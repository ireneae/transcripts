Come on! Come on! Let's do this!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Go! Go! Go!
Rupert and I bought this on our fifth anniversary.
Well, you have exquisite taste.
Do you want it?
But it's a Hockney. It must be worth a million pounds.
Good point. You should've said yes.
Auction pile, please.
Right away, ma'am.
So, Mrs. Mannion-- Excuse me. Ms. Welton.
George is here.
If he's here, why isn't he here?
Yes. Good point.
George.
Higgy boy.
Good one.
Hey. I love what you've done to the place.
Did you do it yourself or get some poof to help you?
I could ask the same of your hair. Please.
She's a cheeky one, isn't she?
Right, love. Listen, I've got training in a minute.
So whatever it is you need to get off your impressive chest, let me have it.
Of course.
You're fired.
Yeah, right.
And I'll be buying out the remainder of your contract. So...
Wish you the best of luck.
Fired? What the fuck for?
I suppose I could go for any number of reasons, really.
Your casual misogyny, for one.
What?
I know, it's a big word.
Ask one of your daughters what it means.
Or perhaps it's your performance, having led this team through yet another remarkably average season.
Or maybe it's because you insist on wearing those tiny shorts that force me to see one of your testicles.
And there's the other one.
Liam and Noel.
Though, perhaps not an oasis.
Still, if I'm being completely honest, George, you're fired because I'm the owner now, and I don't like you.
Now do piss off, you fat twat.
Hey, Higgy boy.
What do you think's worse?
Your husband cheating on you or being the last to know?
Is there someone that could pop out and fetch me a salad?
Nothing with raisins in it, please.
Fuck you.
So, what to do as far as new managers go?
Shall I prepare a list of candidates?
No. That won't be necessary.
This is a bit of surprising news from the other side of the Atlantic.
AFC Richmond announced the hiring of their new manager, one Theodore "Ted" Lasso.
Recently, it was Coach Lasso leading the Division II Wichita State Shockers to their first ever national title in American football.
He took the Shockers from a garbage program all the way to the promised land in his very first season as head coach.
But for a lot of us, that's not how Ted Lasso found his way into our hearts, certainly not into our living rooms.
<i>For me, it'll always be Ted...</i> <i>celebrating a moment of joy with his team</i> <i>in a way that you really have to see to understand.</i> <i>And then, even when you see it...</i> <i>I don't necessarily know that understanding is what we're doing.</i> Right on, Ted. Do your thing, man.
And good luck with the most beautiful game.
Do us proud.
Go, 'Murica.
Oi, mate. This you?
I believe it is, yeah.
Oh, man! Legend.
Can I get an ussie?
That's dope.
You know, back where I'm from, we call those selfies.
Well, it's not "myself," yeah?
It's "us," innit? "Ussie." Yeah. I like that.
Wicked.
You coaching football.
Mate, you are a legend for doing something so stupid.
I mean, it's mental. They're gonna fucking murder you.
Well, you know, I've heard that tune before.
But here I am, still dancing.
Legend.
Yeah. Nice meeting you.
What you reading? Another soccer book.
Coach, you are a sponge.
Come on. Hit me with a fun fact.
They don't say "out of bounds." They say "into touch." Okay, you owe me five bucks if I sneak that into a sentence later.
You're on.
Okay.
<i>Good evening. We'll be dimming the cabin shortly.</i> We should get some sleep. The jet lag will kill us.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are we nuts for doing this?
Yeah, this is nuts.
Hey, but taking on a challenge is a lot like riding a horse, isn't it?
If you're comfortable while you're doing it, probably doing it wrong.
Okay, good night, Coach.
Night, Coach.
Hey, hey, hey!
If we see each other in our dreams, let's goof around a little bit, pretend like we don't know each other.
You got it, stranger.
Nice.
You didn't sleep at all?
Not a wink.
No. My brain just kept on cooking.
At first, I was thinking about not sleeping.
Then I was thinking about thinking about not sleeping. And that-- That's never good.
Next thing you know, they're handing out warm chocolate chip cookies and the plane's landing.
I didn't get a cookie. Did you eat mine?
That's not part of the story. I think this is us right here.
Hey, how ya doin'?
My name's Ted. What's yours?
Ollie.
Ollie. All right.
Let me get your bags.
No, no, no, Ollie. We packed 'em, we'll carry 'em.
Love to make a little pit stop though.
Okay. Follow me.
Yeah. There you go.
Coach, I got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore, right?
I've never actually said that when not in Kansas before.
That's kinda nice.
Yeah.
Well, thanks for indulging us, Ollie.
Ready to boogie whenever you are.
Okay. That's Tower Bridge.
Right. Not the London Bridge, 'cause this one's still up.
You know how they came up with soccer?
So, these Victorian-era headmasters, all they wanted to do was get the boys to stop masturbating.
So they invented a sport where the boys wouldn't use their hands at all, and they thought that might do the trick.
I'm not sure if it worked, but...
Feels different, Coach.
I mean, the same, but different.
Metaphor.
You know it, baby.
Oi!
Oi! Excuse me!
Oi! Hello!
Off! Off!
Stop touching the grass!
Get off! Get off the pitch! Stop touching the grass! Please!
Yep, yep, yep. Yeah.
Who are you?
I'm Ted Lasso. This is Coach Beard here.
Oh, God. You're the new manager.
Yes, sir.
Take all the grass you want.
Oh, no-- We just had it cut. I can go through the garbage.
I can get you some more.
That's all right. No need.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Still, we got to get off the grass.
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
Do we apologize?
Sorry about that, grass.
Sorry, grass.
So, we're supposed to meet with a Rebecca Welton.
Yeah, that's where I'm taking you.
Look at this guy. One step ahead.
Hey, what's your name, by the way?
Me?
Yeah.
No one ever asks my name.
I mean, whenever you're ready.
Oh, it's Nathan.
Nathan! I love that name.
Hey, love your hot dogs.
Yeah. No, I know.
Good, good. Y'all got Nathan's hot dogs here?
No.
Okay.
I love this kid. Love him.
I'll introduce you. Big boss.
Here we go.
Hello.
Hey, how y'all doing? I'm Ted Lasso, your new coach.
You must be Ms. Welton.
Please, call me Rebecca.
Ms. Welton's my father.
If that's a joke, I love it.
If not, I cannot wait to unpack that with you.
This here is Coach Beard.
It is so good to finally meet you both face-to-face.
Higgins?
Sorry. This is Higgins, our current director of communications.
Current?
Could you take Coach Beard and get him their IDs, housing information...
You know, anything they need.
Wi-Fi password, wet wipes.
Humidifier. Way ahead of you, Coach.
Thank you.
Please, take a seat.
Okay.
Can I get you something to drink?
Yes, please.
Didn't get much sleep on the plane, so anything you got, a little boost of caffeine, should do the trick.
You know, mochaccino, Frappuccino...
Any coffee thing, as long as I can't taste a hint of coffee, is good.
How do you take your tea?
Well, usually I take it right back to the counter 'cause someone's made a horrible mistake. But...
when in Rome, right?
Yeah. Look at that. Okay.
Well?
You know, I always figured that tea was just gonna taste like hot brown water.
And you know what?
I was right. Yeah, it's horrible. No, thank you.
Welcome to England.
Yeah. "Get used to it, sucker." Right?
Now, would you like a tour?
I'd love to see Abbey Road.
Of the club.
Yeah, let's start there.
So, this hall represents the club's long, albeit modest, history.
The first match was played in 1897.
During the war, our stadium was used as a makeshift hospital.
Yeah, some of the locals claim they still see fallen soldiers wandering around the pitch.
That's spooky.
Do you believe in ghosts, Ted?
I do.
But more importantly, I think they need to believe in themselves. You know?
Okay.
And this is a wall of our previous owners.
Okay. And now look at this fella up here.
How 'bout the girls and the champagne and everything?
He looks like a good time.
That's my ex-husband.
Well, good times aren't always a good time, I've found.
You know, I heard about all that.
How you holding up?
Yeah, hasn't been the easiest year.
Yeah.
So, we'll need you to speak to the press.
Yeah.
No, after a couple nights' good sleep, I'll be happy to do so.
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew. They're ready for you now.
They're what?
So, without further ado, the new manager of AFC Richmond, Ted Lasso!
Okay.
All right. How y'all doing?
There's Coach.
<i>Oluwa</i> Ted, yo.
Look, our coach.
Oi!
If I don't hear silence, I'm gonna start punching dicks.
One sec. Let me just-- Throat got a little dry.
Did not expect fizzy water there. Sorry.
Look at this twat!
Fucking Yank!
Okay. So, hey.
Why don't we just jump right in? Anybody got any questions?
Oh, yeah, no. Should've saw that coming.
You know what? You can put your hands down.
Real quick-- Yeah.
How about I go ahead and address the larger-than-average elephant in the room.
No, I have never coached the sport that you folks call football at any level.
Jesus.
What?
Heck, you could fill two Internets with what I don't know about football.
But I'll tell you what I do know.
I know that AFC Richmond, like any team I've ever coached, is gonna go out there and give you everything they got for all four quarters.
Halves.
What was that?
Two halves.
Right. Sorry. Halves, yeah.
They're gonna give you everything they got for two halves, win or lose.
Or tie.
Right. Y'all do ties here.
Sorry. That's going to take some getting used to for me.
<i>'Cause back where I'm from, you try to end a game in a tie,</i> well, that might as well be the first sign of the apocalypse.
Now, look here. I respect what you folks in the media do.
And my door is always gonna be open.
All right? You can ask me anything. No topic will be into touch.
All right, one final question.
How about the fellow right there in the second row.
Yeah.
I like your glasses.
Thank you.
Trent Crimm, <i>The Independent</i>.
I just wanna make sure I have this right.
You're an American who's never set foot in England, whose athletic success has only come at the amateur level-- a second-tier one at that-- and is now being charged with the leadership of a Premier League football club, despite clearly possessing very little knowledge of the game.
You got a question in there, Trent?
Yeah.
Is this a fucking joke?
Thank you, Trent!
I love journalists.
I mean, can you even name any footballers?
Well, yeah, you got Ronaldo and the fellow that bends it like himself.
Fucking Beckham! Made a film on it!
You dickhead, mate.
Who the fuck are you?
Do you know how many games are in a Premiership season?
Not off the top of my head, no.
Nobody can understand you.
Who won the league last year?
I actually don't know the answer to that. I'm sorry.
What's a goalie?
The fella with the big Mickey Mouse hands and the-- by the net.
This is bleak.
You need to go back to America.
Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. No, no, I-- The bubbles!
Fucking hell!
Coach Lasso.
Good Lord. You must forgive my fellow countrymen.
Somewhere over the last few years, we seem to have abandoned all sense of manners and hospitality.
My, my, aren't you a salty bunch?
But I can't remember the last time the press room was this full.
Yet here you all are.
Maybe you're not such a mad notion after all.
And despite the number of you here, there is not a single person in this room who has seen Richmond play more than I have.
And in all those years under the stewardship of the previous owner, I've witnessed nothing but profound mediocrity.
Am I wrong?
Well, it's a bit harsh.
Am I wrong?
No.
Now, Coach Lasso may not have the CV that you all find acceptable, but he does have one thing this club doesn't: a trophy from this millennium.
So, like it or not, Richmond are changing the way we do things.
And from now on, that way is the "Lasso way." We look forward to seeing you all at our next match with Crystal Palace.
Thank you so much.
Nice meeting y'all.
And sorry for spittin' on all your stuff up here.
Thank you.
I give him three weeks.
Oh, boy. I'm sorry about that. I don't know what happened.
Ted, don't you think about them for another second.
You have a job to do.
And proving them wrong, just been added to the list.
I appreciate that-- Thank you, Coach.
Yeah.
See, I'm fine when there's no bubbles. You know, I can do that all day.
Okay. You know, I'd love to say hi to the team, if I can.
Can't keep a gaffer from his pitch.
You can say that again. Okay.
I am 0 for 2 in that sentence.
Ms. Welton, I was a bit skeptical, but after hearing you speak in there, I'm excited by your choice.
Coach Lasso is just what we need.
He's an absolute wanker.
I know.
Pardon?
I hope he fails miserably.
See, my ex-husband truly loved only one thing his entire life: this club.
And Ted Lasso is gonna help me burn it to the ground.
'Cause I want to torture Rupert.
I want him to feel like he's being fucked in the ass with a splintered cricket bat.
Just in and out, over and over, in a constant loop.
Like a GIF.
That's what GIFs do, isn't it? They're just...
endless.
That's correct.
Though some people pronounce it "JIF." Thank you, Higgins.
Thank you.
Okay, let me use it in a sentence, so it sticks.
The "gaffer"-- me-- is going out to the "pitch"-- Yeah.
... the grass here-- to watch practice.
"Training." They call practice "training." All this vernacular. Gonna be tough.
You know what? I'm gonna get it though. 'Cause training makes perfect.
There you go.
There's our man.
Jesus, Mary and fuckface Joseph!
Eyes on the man you're marking! Come on!
Who is that?
Roy Kent.
Team captain. Classic old-school box-to-box midfielder.
Definitely lost a step.
But, you know, he's a legend.
Won a Champions League with Chelsea, so...
Eight years ago.
Yeah.
Oh, God, what?
That is a darn fine sports mix, young fella.
Coach, you try this?
That does not come lightly from that fella, I'll tell you that.
You continue to impress, Nathan.
You remembered my name.
Holy smokes! Did you see that?
That fella looked like a kitty cat when it gets spooked by a cucumber.
Who the heck is that?
Jamie Tartt.
Top scorer on the team.
Fuck off.
Nate, what's he like?
Who, Jamie?
He's great.
You know, at football.
Yeah, I know fellas like that.
Sam Obisanya. He's a right back defender outta the Nigerian league.
Nigeria? Like Africa?
So these fellas are from all over the place?
I'm open, boyo.
I mean, he must be from England, yeah?
Wales.
Is that another country?
Yes and no.
How many countries are in this country?
Four.
Four.
It's kinda like America these days.
Right.
I do love a locker room.
Smells like potential.
And am I getting notes of Axe body spray?
Spot on, Coach.
But I think they call it something else here.
Ding, ding, ding.
Lynx.
My favorite of the jungle cats.
Come here. Look at your face. Look at your face.
Thanks, thanks, thanks.
Yeesh.
Last time I saw eyes that cold, they were going head-to-head with Roy Scheider.
<i>-Jaws</i>?
No, <i>All That Jazz</i>.
I'm gonna say something. Howdy, fellas.
Don't stop what you're doing.
My name's Ted Lasso. This here is Coach Beard.
I know we don't officially start quite yet, but, you know, we just wanted to pop in, say howdy, let you know how excited we are to be here-- Knock, knock.
Is everyone in here decent?
Boys, that's disappointing.
Oh, shit. Am I interrupting you?
No, no, that's okay. How can I help you?
No, I'm here to pick up that one.
Yeah. Sorry, Coach.
She made me an appointment. I'm getting waxed.
It's more for the fans than it is for me.
Score a goal, gotta take my shirt off.
Sweetheart.
I mean, I can stay if you want.
No, that's okay.
All right, cheers.
Yeah.
There you go.
All right, kid, after you.
You're gonna be a gentleman now, are you?
No, babe. Just gonna watch your ass.
Fuck off.
Watch it and weep.
Anyhoo, thank you for your time.
Coach. You gotta stay up.
Come on, man. Don't be a sleep cop.
Roy! Hey, Roy!
Yeah? What do you want?
It was real fun watching you out there today.
You know, the boys really respond to you.
It doesn't surprise me though. You've had a heck of a career.
Thank you.
Never thought it would end being coached by Ronald fucking McDonald.
You gonna let him call you that?
I don't think he was referring to me.
He thinks he's mad now, wait till we win him over.
He'll be furious.
You got any tape?
What you doing in there?
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I shouldn't laugh.
It's okay.
No, I was just making some adjustments to the locker room here.
Nice, yeah.
Though, I believe it's crooked.
Now here I am thinking it was the room that was all outta whack.
But you know what? I think you're right.
What you doing back here? Where's Jamie?
He left his phone in his locker.
Why didn't he come get it?
He's still getting waxed. He's surprisingly furry.
The hair was, like, growing back while she was doing it.
Come on, now.
May I?
Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.
Thanks.
Lower it down on that side.
Great.
Keep going. Little bit.
Teeny bit more.
Stop! That's perfect.
All right. How 'bout that? Nice teamwork.
Pow. Yeah.
Old-school.
I'm Keeley, by the way.
Yeah. Hey, I'm Ted Lasso.
No, I know. You're trending hard on Twitter right now.
How 'bout that.
Do you even tweet?
Nah.
But I do beatbox all right.
I never know how to react when a grown man beatboxes in front of me.
Well, I hope you never run into Biz Markie.
All right.
Well, if you get curious and you start searching around on Twitter, I would avoid ♪Richmond.
Okay.
Or wanker. Or dick.
Well, I'll take your word for it.
Welcome to England.
Thank you. Hey, and thanks again for the lift.
That's all right.
Hey, this you, Nate?
That one? God, no. No, couldn't handle that.
This is me. Green one here.
Right. So, get that in there.
Come on.
Already burning the midnight oil, I see, Ted.
Well, as the man once said, "The harder you work, the luckier you get," huh?
On the diagonal.
My apologies, Ted. We should have ordered you a car.
Oh, no. That's okay.
Night, y'all.
Got it.
What is wrong with you?
It's just that everything I've eaten today...
feels like it's stuck right here.
I got it. I got it.
Here we go.
He seems like such a nice man. I'm not sure I can do this.
Obviously, for this to work, I'm going to need the full support of my new director of football operations.
I'm assuming that's a promotion and substantial pay rise that would be of interest to you and your family.
Hey, look, this car's got an invisible steering wheel!
I'm just kidding.
It's my man Nate here running the horn.
You're a godsend, Ted Lasso.
Takes one to know one.
Well?
I accept.
Wonderful.
Oh, and Higgins, I know that there'll be elements to this little adventure that will weigh on you a bit.
But I'm sure it won't be harder than it was to sneak all Rupert's women in and out behind my back all those years.
This is you, Coach.
Okay. All right. You good?
I'm good. You good?
Yeah.
Night, Coach.
Good night, Coach.
I almost forgot.
What's this for?
"Into touch." Get some sleep, Coach.
Yeah, I will.
Hey, big guy. How you doing? How was school today?
Right.
No, I forgot.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a little loopy today.
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.
No, no, that's okay. No. I just wanted to hear your voice.
Yeah. Yeah, go do your thing. Yeah.
Hey, is your mom there?
Okay. Thanks, big guy.
Hey, I miss you.
Yeah, I love you too.
Okay.
Hey, how you doing?
Yeah. Well, you know, so far so good. You know?
It's gonna take some getting used to, yeah.
But I think once we get going, it's gonna go all right.
Yeah. No, that's true, that's true. Yeah.
Well, you know what? It's actually pretty nice. Yeah.
Yeah, and tell you what, they got a cute neighborhood too.
Yeah.
Yeah, you and the little guy gotta get on over here.
Come check it out.
What? No, what did I say?
But that's what I'm doing though. I'm giving you that space.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, and myself. Right.
Okay.
No, no. That's okay. Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Michelle.
I love you.
No, no, that's okay. You don't have to.
Really. Yeah.
Okay.
All right, now. Good night.
Shoot. Now I can't sleep.
 @@@@@@
Morning, Coach.
Morning, Coach.
You wanna grab some breakfast?
Nah, I just had one piece of cereal and I'm pretty stuffed.
Could go for coffee though.
Yeah.
You know what today feels like?
First day of school.
First day of school. That's right.
That's close.
What about you, Coach? How you feeling?
A little nervous.
Well, heck, yeah. No such thing as "last-day jitters." Gotta look right, Coach.
Yeah. I'm gonna get that someday.
<i>So blues</i> <i>I can tell you</i> Check out my man here.
<i>So blues, I can tell you</i> A girl's not gettin' by me.
Sometimes the best way to stick it to the man is go right between his legs, huh?
We gotta go, Coach.
Yeah.
Knock-a-doodle-do.
Good morning, Coach Lasso.
Hey, look at us.
Couple of worm-addicted early birds, am I right?
Well, I'm glad I caught ya. I brought you a little something.
Yeah. Cookies.
Or as y'all call 'em here, biscuits, right?
Though, I do not recommend you smother these in gravy.
Ted, I don't really-- Come on now. Take a lookie there.
Those do look good.
Right?
Go ahead, take a nibble.
That's it. Away you go.
Fuck me.
Where did you get these?
I'm glad you like 'em.
You know what? I'll start bringing these to ya every morning.
Call it "Biscuits with the Boss." That really isn't necessary.
Okay, well, mark this down as the first time we disagree then.
Actually, no, second time. Tea is horrible.
Absolute garbage water. I don't know why y'all do that.
Anyhoo, you know, we can't really be good partners unless we get to know each other, right?
Ted-- We're gonna start simple. Real easy, real easy one.
We're gonna do first concert, best concert.
You go ahead and go first. Go. Right off the bat. Come on.
The Spice Girls. And... the Spice Girls.
Same answer for both? I love that. My turn. First concert.
I mean, come on. It was "The Gambler" himself, Mr. Kenny Rogers.
Okay, I'm sorry-- Ted-- Coach Lasso.
Stop. Ted, I'm sorry.
"Biscuits with the Boss" is not something that I have time for this morning.
Or ever.
I hear ya, boss. Loud and clear.
There we go.
Okay.
You're gonna show up tomorrow with biscuits, aren't you?
Come on now. I would not bet on that.
I mean, unless you wanna win a buttload of money.
High five, tree.
Remember what you said to me our first day coaching at Wichita State?
Lose the ponytail?
Relax. They're just kids.
Well, these fellas sure as heck ain't kids.
Hey, look at Isaac. He looks like a Rodin sculpture in cleats.
Boots.
They call cleats "boots." I thought you said that the trunk of a car was a boot.
Also a boot.
Hold on now. If I were to get fired from my job where I'm puttin' cleats in the trunk of my car-- You got the boot from puttin' boots in the boot.
I love that.
All right, gentlemen. Let's go ahead and do a little seven on seven.
We're gonna call this drill "<i>The Exorcist</i>" 'cause it's all about controlling possession.
All right, let's go!
Fuck!
Someone get some flowers, 'cause this spot here is where Sam died.
It's very sad.
Oi. Walk away, you little prick.
All right, granddad. Keep your wig on.
Thanks, Roy.
Yeah, you're good.
Hey, Sam, come here a sec.
Coach, I'm sorry.
You know what the happiest animal on earth is?
It's a goldfish.
You know why?
No.
Got a ten-second memory.
Be a goldfish, Sam. Yeah?
Yeah, you got it. Go ahead.
Hey, Nate.
Who, me?
Yeah. Until we get another Nate here, I just need you to assume you're my default Nate, okay?
Come on, question for ya. What's the buzz on Sam here?
Seems a little down in the dumps.
Yeah, he's been underachieving since he got here from Nigeria, so...
Yeah, well, first time away from home is never easy.
We're gonna have to do something to Ni-cheer-ia him up, man.
You still laughing at stuff you don't think is funny, huh?
I'm not always sure what's a joke and what isn't.
Yeah, it's tough to tell these days, isn't it?
<i>Go, Lasso! Go, Lasso, go!</i> <i>Go, Lasso! Go, Lasso, go! Go, Lasso! Go, Lasso, go!</i> Higgins.
Ted Lasso was in my office.
"What's the first concert you ever saw?" Boy George.
Not you, you garden gnome.
He wants us to get together every morning to get to know me and hear what I've got to say.
The nerve!
I mean, the man's just relentless and nice.
Everywhere he's been, his players seem to love him.
It's the one thing that could just muck this up.
Hello, boys.
Up top.
Hello, Miss Welton.
Hello, Miss Welton.
Higgins, do you know which of the players has the most sway in the locker room?
No.
So helpful. Then solve me this different mystery.
Find out where Lasso got those biscuits.
Watch out, biscuits! Higgins is on the case.
All right, fellas. Excuse me.
Listen up!
Thank you, Coach.
Now, we got Crystal Palace coming here on Saturday.
Anything we need to know, Coach?
Lot of speed on the outside.
Okay. Anything else?
Lot of speed.
Okay, you heard the man.
Y'all whipped 'em up pretty good earlier this year, so me and Coach ain't gonna mess with the game plan.
But...
we would like to start fiddling with the way we do things in the locker room.
And if the Internet has taught us anything, it's that sometimes it's easier to speak our minds anonymously.
Right? So I asked Nate here to make us a good old-fashioned suggestion box.
Hey, look at that.
Yeah, did it with my niece. She loves crafts, so-- Yeah. I love glimpses into your personal life.
This is lovely.
So, if anything's got y'all hot and bothered, just go ahead and drop us a note.
You could have issue with the color of the towels or, heck, the food in the vending machine.
Sound good?
Okay, great. See y'all tomorrow.
Oi. We're middle of the table, we've lost three of four, and you wanna know if the snacks in the locker room are tasty enough?
Are they?
Jesus Christ.
They are not.
That's a long time to wait, Ted.
Well, I respect you didn't hurry.
So, how was your first official day?
I'm not entirely sure what y'all's smallest unit of measurement is over here, but that's about how much headway I made.
And yet, you seem undeterred.
Solid entrance.
What would you rather be, a lion or a panda?
I don't have time for this.
Okay.
Ted?
Gotta go panda.
Are you mad? Pandas are fat and lazy and have piss-stained fur.
Lions are powerful and majestic and rule the jungle.
Try telling that to an elephant. Can I be an elephant?
Lion or panda.
Panda.
Lion!
What's black and white and red all over?
I don't know. What?
A panda that gets anywhere near a fucking lion. The answer is lion.
All right.
That Rebecca is an intimidating, very tall woman.
I mean, the minute she locked eyes with me, I started sweating.
Oh, no. She got some fences, all right, but you just gotta hop over 'em.
Hi, babe.
Here. Keys.
Hey, Jamie, what would you rather be? A lion or a panda?
Coach, I'm me.
Why would I wanna be anything else?
I'm not sure you realize how psychologically healthy that actually is.
Cheers.
<i>Night Court</i>.
Wow.
He's a lion.
Definitely lion.
You know pandas eat their weight in bamboo? My little boy told me that.
No!
What are you talking about?
Pandas are capable of it.
I don't know how often they actually do that.
<i>Sam's down in every stat since Nigeria.</i> Maybe the Premiership's too much for him.
No, he just needs to get a little more comfy here, that's all.
He turns 20 on Saturday.
There we go. A birthday.
We'll do something special for him.
Nudge that ship in the right direction, yeah?
Hey.
Let's see what we got here.
"Wanker." Let's see what else we got. "Piss off, wanker." "I hope you choke on a Big Mac." Good thing these are anonymous.
No, Roy signed that one.
Roy.
Here's a good one.
"Shower pressure is rubbish." Make a note of that.
"Wanker." Yep.
I'm not gonna say that word out loud.
Another "wanker." You don't wanna let them call you a wanker, Ted. It's bad.
What's a wanker?
I'm a visual learner, so that's very helpful. Thank you.
My pleasure.
Okay, I got one.
What if I joined forces with a swashbuckling cat to play tiny guitars for women of the night as we read Alex Haley's most seminal work?
You'd be in cahoots with Puss in Boots, playing lutes for prostitutes, reading <i>Roots</i>.
No, <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i>. I gotcha.
All right.
Here we go. Hey, hold my beer.
All right, see what you got, young lady. Come on. What you got? What you got?
Are you kidding me?
You see that?
She spun you around like the Tasmanian Devil.
Yeah, she did. Except without all that annoying...
Wrong again.
Why is this so hard for you, Higgins?
What time is it?
It's "Biscuits with the Boss" time!
And Higgins! Hey.
Three's a crowd.
Hey, that's a crowd I don't mind being smack-dab in the middle of, buddy.
Hey, boss. Check this out. Pow.
Let's tie up some loose ends from yesterday.
First concert, Kenny Rogers, right?
Best concert, we got Beastie Boys at HORDE Fest, 1995.
You're gonna love this story.
Actually, did y'all get the O. J. trial over here?
Ted, please. I can't just have you waltzing in here whenever you wish.
What if I soft-shoe in, huh? Little something like that.
Or I can moonwalk in.
Despite recent headlines, it's still a fun dance move to do.
Ted, Ted.
You gotta see the way I see it, okay?
Everybody in this building, part of the team. Part of AFC Richmond.
Team's gotta bond. All right?
I mean, heck, Higgins and I are having lunch today.
Yes. We're having salads in my office.
All right, catch you later, boss.
Higgins, see you at lunch, huh?
Caesar you later.
Yes. Yes.
He's intolerable.
Boy. That is bad.
Somebody ought to check this thing's prostate.
Jeez.
Yeah.
Hey, Sam. You gotta pop upstairs real quick.
Higgins wants to talk to you.
Let's go. Move it, move it.
Yep, yep. He's gone, he's gone.
Shut the door, shut the door. Hey. Yo, hey, guys. Listen up, listen up.
Okay, Sam's birthday is on Saturday.
So I was thinking we'd all chip in and get him something nice.
Nice gift or something. Right?
So, Nate's gonna be coming around with yet another impressive box.
Look at this. It's got a face!
He has a face.
Sorry, it-- He. He.
You put the money in his mouth.
Okay, you hear that, y'all?
You put the money in his mouth. Got it? Okay, good.
Go get 'em, Nate.
Okay? Help him out.
All right. Lovely. Thanks, Colin.
You put the money in his mouth.
Yummy for you.
It's spearmint. Make the money smell nice.
Thank you, Jamie. That's incredibly thoughtful.
Hey, Jamie. Real quick.
Just wanna have a chat. Did you put gum in the box there?
Yeah. Yeah.
Now, why'd you go and do that?
Sorry, Coach.
Nate's just trying to help us out here.
He's part of the team, right?
Yeah, right, Coach. Yeah, yeah.
And I see this team like a band.
I love that.
And if we were the Rolling Stones, I'd be Mick Jagger, 'cause I'm the front man.
Sure.
I got the moves.
Got a tiny waist, yeah. The whole bit. I get it.
And Roy would be Keith Richards, 'cause he's old and everyone's surprised he ain't dead yet.
What the fuck are you saying?
Roy, mate, if you're gonna go to the shower, you should take your sweater off first, pal.
I'm just taking the piss, mate. Yeah.
I'll be better. Promise.
Glad to hear it. Yeah.
Marcus, what you got?
How are you feeling about taking on Crystal Palace this weekend?
A palace made out of crystal seems mighty fragile if you ask me.
Coach.
Coach!
Yeah, right there.
Trent Crimm, <i>The Independent</i>.
I remember, Trent.
I'm just curious. Could you explain the offside rule?
Well, Trent, I'm gonna put it the same way the US Supreme Court did back in 1964 when they defined pornography.
It ain't easy to explain, but you know it when you see it.
Yeah, this gentleman right here.
Ernie Lounds, <i>The Sun</i>.
Thank you.
This question's for Ms. Mannion.
It's "Welton." Of course. My apologies.
Any thoughts on the newest Rupert girl?
Well, Rupert and I are no longer together, so...
He may consort with whatever model-actress, actress-model he pleases.
No, the girl who came forward today is another one who was with Rupert while you were married.
I mean, she says it started five years ago.
And they kept it going until, well, still.
Oh.
And all this time I thought men couldn't multitask.
I'm afraid that's all we have time for.
Thank you so much.
Coach!
Hey. How are you?
Just wanna make sure you're doing okay.
You know, that was pretty rough back there.
I expect nothing less from the press.
Yeah.
Sorry, did you need somebody to post that? Because that person's not me.
No, come on. This is a care package from my little boy.
Maybe something in here can help cheer you up, yeah?
Got a small battalion of army men.
Says here on the card that I'm supposed to set 'em up in my apartment to help keep me safe.
Homemade kazoo.
Excellent.
Only got one of those though, so you can't have that.
Hey now.
Look at that right there.
You know, this right here is some of the best barbecue sauce in Kansas City, which makes it some of the best barbecue sauce in the world.
Yes!
You got some kind of food or something that can teleport you back home, make you feel warm and fuzzy?
No.
Will that be all, Ted?
No.
No, actually, the whole reason I'm here is 'cause I'm having a little trouble figuring out Jamie Tartt's operating instructions, and I was just seeing if you happened to have any advice.
Sorry, I'm afraid-- Your eyes just lit up. You got an idea. What is it? Go on.
I was just gonna say you should go and talk to Keeley.
I mean, you two have an obvious rapport. If anyone knows Jamie, it's her.
See, that's why you're the boss, right?
That's good. Hey, tell you what I'm gonna do though.
I'm gonna give you one of these stinkers. Let's see. Let's get you a good one.
Okay, this right here is gonna be your first line of defense, in case that little turkey Ernie Lounds comes back around, huh?
How about that? We'll aim him right at the door there for you.
All right, thanks, boss. I appreciate you.
Yes! You look beautiful. Just pet the lion.
Exactly!
I love it. Give me a growl, yeah.
Sexy, yeah.
Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah, all right.
Let's set up for the next shot.
Hi.
Hey, how you doing?
Yeah, I'm all right. How are you?
Yeah, not bad. So, you went with the lion, huh?
Yeah.
I'm a little hurt, but it looks cool.
I look insane.
But I do think it's a better look than the panda.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, I'm famished.
Yeah?
Most lions are.
Look. Let's get some food.
Okay.
You hungry?
Yeah, is it free?
Gotta be pretty fun for you, yeah?
Yeah. I'm getting paid a shit ton to get dressed up like an animal and sell caffeinated vodka.
But I do get to go home with the paws.
Well, there's the perks right there. Yeah.
Can I have a bite?
Yeah. There you go.
Thank you.
Careful. You're welcome.
I know that you didn't just pop down to feed me.
No, you're right. I wanted to ask you about Jamie.
Yeah.
What would you say motivates him?
Blow jobs.
Is there a second option?
Go on, give us another bite.
Hey. There you are.
Now, look, I know the kid's gonna be a star.
I was kinda hoping he'd, you know, warm up to the team building I'm trying to do here. That's all.
Actually, he responds well to positive reinforcement.
That's my wheelhouse.
There you go, then.
Okay. Bite.
Go on, give us one more bite.
Here you go.
Yeah.
That was a big one.
Well, yep.
You got some ketchup there.
Looks like you devoured an antelope.
Help me.
Just be careful. Hold on.
Yeah, I feel that. There's a lot of it.
Yeah, it's a lot and I'm just-- Richmond! Richmond!
<i>We are moments away from Crystal Palace facing AFC Richmond</i> <i>and their new manager, Ted Lasso.</i> <i>While on the pitch, all eyes will surely be on young phenom, Jamie Tartt.</i> All right, fellas, here we go. Here we go.
Coach, you got any last words?
Speed on the outside.
Speed on the outside. You heard the man.
That's all we got for you, except for one thing.
And that's Happy Birthday, Sam!
Babatunde's the best.
Hey.
Hey, enjoy.
Hey, man, you guys got me Chin Chin.
Wow, this is all I used to eat growing up.
We know you haven't been home in a while, so we thought we'd bring some home to you.
You guys, man.
Hey. Happy Birthday, Sam.
Thank you, Coach.
We got a few things in there for you.
Coach, what's this?
Well, my little boy gave me a whole bunch of these.
You know, help keep me safe while I'm away.
I miss him, you know.
My dad used to-- always used to pinch my earlobes for good luck.
Give me a fucking break.
Sorry, Coach.
Coach, is it okay if I don't keep this?
I don't really have the same fondness for the American military that you do.
Sure. Right.
Imperialism. Right. Yeah.
Imperialism.
Thank you, Coach. Thank you.
All right, fellas.
Let's get out there and show Crystal Palace whose house this is, right?
<i>West meets South again.</i> <i>It's Derby Day in London, and the atmosphere is electric.</i> <i>With a new owner in the boardroom and a new manager in the dugout,</i> <i>will it be a new dawn for the perennial underdog, AFC Richmond?</i> Welcome to what the home fans call the "Dogtrack." It's Nelson Road Stadium, for AFC Richmond against Crystal Palace.
I'm Arlo White and this is Chris Powell.
<i>And it's great to be here, Arlo.</i> You ready?
Your fly is down.
Thank you.
All right, shall we?
<i>Chris, did you ever play under an American manager?</i> <i>Never did, Arlo. Wouldn't have minded it. I do speak the language.</i> Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!
<i>To the fans at home, we do apologize for the fruity language.</i> Wanker! Wanker!
<i>It was a risky hire by new owner, Rebecca Welton.</i> <i>Does she know something we don't?</i> Wanker! Wanker!
Oi! Give him a chance.
Wanker!
We got 90 minutes to prove 'em wrong, yeah?
Let's give it a shot.
<i>Here we go.</i> <i>And there you go.</i> <i>It's an inauspicious start to the Ted Lasso era.</i> <i>Richmond looked disjointed, uninspired, and, you have to say, joyless.</i> <i>Palace win and Richmond lose 4-1.</i> <i>The only bright spot being the defensive play of Sam Obisanya.</i> Only bright spot?
Without me, it would've been 4-0, you miserable old pricks.
<i>And a meaningless consolation goal for Jamie Tartt in injury time.</i> Thank you!
Jamie. Real quick.
<i>Regarding Jamie Tartt,</i> <i>it was an insignificant goal by the Manchester City loanee,</i> <i>but he celebrated like he'd just won the World Cup.</i> I haven't known you that long, but...
I can honestly say you are the best athlete I have ever coached.
Wow.
Yeah. I mean, I work hard, yeah.
I see it.
You are truly great at everything you do out there.
Except for one thing.
My left foot cross?
No. Jamie, I think that you might be so sure that you're one in a million, that sometimes you forget that out there, you're just one of eleven.
And if you just figure out some way to turn that "me" into "us"...
the sky's the limit for you.
Was a heck of a goal out there, by the way.
Thanks.
<i>Richmond fall to 13th place.</i> <i>I'm sure they won't be there very long.</i> <i>Is that optimism, Chris?</i> <i>No. Actually, I'm wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein.</i> That was fucking embarrassing!
I am equally livid.
Blimey, mate.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God.
Didn't know he had it in him.
Good lad.
Oh, my God.
Hey, come on now.
Hey, let's shake this one off, all right?
Start getting better on Monday. Until then-- Hey, DJ Beard-o, why don't you help pick up the mood in here, all right?
Little Phife Dawg and Q-Tip comin' at you.
Come on now. Everybody get some cake.
You know, it's Sam's birthday. Go ahead, get some sugar in your system.
Go on now.
Hey, y'all.
I come bearing sweet treats to numb the sting of defeat.
Yeah.
Thank you.
And hey, just so you know, we can play a lot better than we showed today.
I know it would mean a lot to the guys if y'all just came down, joined in.
Let 'em know you're still in their corner.
That's all the arm twisting I'm gonna do though, okay?
Ted, you know what might convince me?
If you told me where you got these delicious biscuits.
Well, if I did that, I wouldn't be able to bring you more on Monday, would I?
All right. Hope to see y'all downstairs.
It's good cake.
Jamie! Trent Crimm, <i>The Independent</i>.
That was quite a beating today. How you taking the loss?
Look, it's not just me though, is it? We're a team. I'm just one of eleven.
Candy from a baby.
Okay.
They were rubbish.
Fuck it. Yeah, I am taking it pretty hard, you know?
The rest of them, they're all in there eating cake.
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously, mate.
The new gaffer's got music on in there. It's like a party. It's a joke.
Careful, son. The gaffer's fixed the water pressure.
I hate losing.
Bird by bird, Coach.
Good night, Coach.
Night, Coach.
Here's trouble.
I saw the match.
Yeah? What'd you think?
You were rubbish.
Yeah, maybe so.
Yeah.
I did wanna get your advice on one thing.
What do you think-- Look at that! Got ya!
Yeah? All right, I underestimated you.
Yeah.
See, no one sees me coming. Come on, what you got? What you got?
That was quick. Okay, I'm gonna take my backpack off now.
We're gonna really do this.
Let me stretch here a little bit.
All right. Yeah.
Here we go. Okay. All right, now you're in trouble.
Get your breath back.
What?
I just sent you the pictures.
That's exactly what I wanted.
The star player's girlfriend and the new manager.
Are you sure you want to do this?
<i>The press will eat them alive.</i> <i>Miss Welton?</i> Do it.
 @@@@@@
Fuck!
Siri, call Shithead.
Good morning.
<i>There is nothing in</i> The Sun <i>about Ted and Keeley.</i> Nothing. Are you in your office?
Of course I am.
Then get up here now.
Bye, boys. Tell Mum I love her.
Knock, knock. Hey, boss, I don't know about you, but I had an absolute peach of a Sunday.
Here you go.
Yeah, finally saw Big Ben.
Boy, I thought I'd seen the biggest clock there was.
When I was a kid, my folks took me to the Allen-Bradley Clock Tower up there in Milwaukee.
They ended up leaving me there all by myself.
Yeah, three hours and 42 minutes. You know how I know that?
You were staring at a clock?
I was staring at a clock. That's exactly right. Yeah, bingo.
That's a little bit of a mystery puzzle.
You figured it out right away. You're a sharp cookie.
Ted.
Yeah.
Speaking as we were mere moments ago, about time, I unfortunately don't have any.
I have a branding meeting, so...
I always feel so bad for the cows, but you gotta do it otherwise they get lost.
That was a branding joke.
If we were in Kansas right now, I'd just be sitting here waiting for you to finish laughing. Yeah.
I'll see ya tomorrow, okay?
Okay. Counting the minutes.
Yeah, there you are.
All right. Let's see what we got here. I've got this fella up here, the goalie.
Then all these guys over here, okay?
And going over here, going over that way.
This son of a gun's gonna go all the way down here.
Crystal Palace kicked our booties last week.
And this here, is our current offense that we are running, and I think it stinks!
Get rid of it.
Now, you might be wondering why'd I draw all that up there just to erase it.
And that is because I believe in symbolic gestures.
As do I.
What time did you get home last night?
Didn't.
Really?
Now, look, our whole offense right now is all give-and-go.
Give the ball to Jamie and everyone else can go to hell.
So, I am officially on the prowl for any new ideas, you hear?
You got something, Nate?
No.
So...
No. No. God, no. Never mind, I'm sorry.
Come on now. You're one of us. Let's go. Fire away. What do you got?
Okay, right. Well, it's just... No, other pocket.
It's just something that I thought of.
Sorry. Jesus.
Not that one.
You know what, it's not even very good.
It's probably really bad. It's embarrassing even.
I just-- Sorry, Nate.
I have a real tricky time hearing folks that don't believe in themselves.
I'm gonna ask you real quick again.
Do you think this idea will work?
Yeah, I do.
Why you screaming at us, Nate?
God!
We're right here.
All right, come on now. Walk us through it.
Okay. So, I thought if we started the attack on the wing, Jamie could run through nearside, then when the defense follows, Sam could fill his spot.
So, use Jamie as a decoy?
No.
No. Well, yeah, in-- Yeah, in this case, yes.
Let's give it a shot.
What, you're gonna use my play?
Yeah. I mean, we're gonna try it on, see if it fits.
You know, it might not.
Then again, it might be a very flattering silhouette, and I might wear it right outta the store.
Makes me feel good and I start to strut.
I'm like, "I like this. I like the way this makes me feel." Show him your strut, Coach.
Yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah. Yep, that's how to strut.
Let me see you strut, Nate. Come on.
There you go, Nate. Yeah, that's one way to do it.
There you go.
You look a little angry, but that's all right.
That's my fault. I forgot the pitch is right this way.
Come on, let's go. Strut this way. Here we go.
Still strutting.
I'll see you later. Yeah.
Yeah.
Ted! Hey, have you got a minute?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything okay?
Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine, yeah.
It's not fine. Everything's shit.
Oh, no.
This was gonna be the front page of <i>The Sun</i> today.
"Manager Shags Star Player's Girlfriend." I think a more accurate headline would be, "Manager Innocently Feeds Young Woman Whose Relationship Does Not Define Her." Ted, this is really bad!
Except I look insanely fit in this picture.
Yeah, no, it's beautiful light.
My friend who works at the paper said he can hold this story for one day as a favor.
When this shit hits, Jamie is going to go mental.
There's going to be photographers all over us.
Right, right.
The next picture of me will not be this perfect.
I am gonna be mid-sneeze face, like-- Guess what the headline will be.
Gesundheit?
"Jamie's Tart Breaks Tartt's Heart." Did you just come up with that?
Yeah.
Everyone would read that.
Of course they would.
You have no idea the power of rhyming in this goddamn country.
Yeah.
"Lasso Makes Passo and Creates Team Fiasco." Keeley's got bars.
Yeah, I'm cute as a button and I can rhyme my ass off.
God, it's no wonder they want to destroy me.
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry, it took me so long to get up the stairs.
I was... stopped to talk by about a hundred people.
Still nothing.
Get someone to run the story about Ted and Keeley.
Hey, boss.
Ted! And Keeley. Hello.
Hey, I found that in the hall. Yeah.
So, we got ourselves a situation here.
Go ahead, show her the picture, yeah.
See? And the fucking <i>Sun</i> is running it tomorrow.
Honestly, these people, they just have no regard for people's privacy and dignity.
Yeah, I'm gonna find the piece of shit that took this and who hired them.
No, no. Not necessary.
I know the owner of the paper. I can get this stopped with a phone call.
Really? Oh, my God. Thank you.
See, what I tell ya, huh?
This woman right here is strong, confident and powerful.
Boss, I tell ya, I'd hate to see you and Michelle Obama arm wrestle, but I wouldn't be able to take my eyes off it either.
That's not a compliment I've had before.
You do have perfect action figure-y arms.
Yeah.
There's another one. Anyway, glad to help.
All right. Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay.
See y'all later.
There's no way she can trace that photo back to me, can she?
Yes.
What do you mean "yes"?
Did you not use an alias or a burner phone?
I'm not a spy, Rebecca. I'm just the director of football operations.
And equally proficient at both.
Well, thank you. Wait...
Okay, here we go. Sam lays it for Dickson.
Okay, nice touch.
Switch to Bumbercatch.
Jamie decoys through.
Sam wide open.
There it is!
Nice play, Nate. How you feel?
I just don't know. So many new feelings. Yeah.
Kinda like getting your first pube, right?
Yeah. What?
Here we go.
All right. Hey. Nice work.
Okay, now, gentlemen, here's the other thing we're gonna start focusing on.
Making quicker transitions from offense to defense.
Y'all gotta start making your hellos goodbyes. You understand?
Easiest way to get that done well is to do it well.
But aside from that, you gotta be in great shape, right?
So, we are all gonna run two laps around this field.
Anyone who loses to me has to run four more. Let's go!
Okay, come on. What you got?
What's going on?
You're catching up. Don't cut that corner!
Come on. You can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man.
Faster, boys!
Look at his face.
Colin, Isaac, please stop.
Yeah, it really hurts now. It really hurts.
Be careful, Colin, now. That's our new coach.
Oh, right, boyo.
Yeah.
Sorry, gaffer.
Thank you.
Okay, way to run out there today, fellas.
You guys are much faster than me.
Except Coach Beard.
What's going on? I thought you ran track in high school or something.
Chess team, Coach.
Illinois State Champs, baby.
Okay, yeah. Illinois is a state, fellas.
One last thing, there are some gifts up in y'all's lockers.
In your little cubbies up there. So, hope you enjoy 'em.
It's a fucking book.
Nice one, bitch boy.
Hey.
Yeah, I just thought you should know that your boy Nathan's being harassed every single day by Jamie and his little... side-pricks.
Right.
So you know already?
Yep.
So, you'll take care of it?
No.
What the fuck?
Roy, I learned two pretty big lessons on the rough-and-tumble playgrounds of Brookridge Elementary School.
One, if little Ronnie Fowch offers you a candy bar, you immediately say no, and you get the hell outta there.
'Cause there's a good chance that little son of a gun has just pooped inside of a Butterfinger wrapper.
No one ever saw him do it, but a couple people ate it.
Number two, if the teacher tells the bully not to pick on someone, it's just gonna make it worse.
So, you're not gonna do anything?
No.
Why you winding him up?
He's the one, Coach.
If we're gonna make an impact here, the first domino that needs to fall is right inside that man's heart.
Yes.
Jamie, can I ask you something?
It's 40 kilos. I do three sets of ten.
And then I alternate between bis and tris.
I don't give a shit what you lift, you little pretty boy.
Yeah, you do, 'cause you asked.
Can you curl 40 kilos?
No, but I can use your balls as a speed bag.
Do you wanna try that?
Not especially.
Do you even understand the influence you have on this team?
I'm the shit, yeah.
No, you're a bellend.
But because your right foot was kissed by God the boys look up to you.
It's made me question my own faith.
So, when they pick on Nate...
and you laugh...
Yeah.
... they think it's okay.
Right, 'cause Nate's a weak baby and he can't do anything about it.
Yeah, all right. I'll take care of it. Nate's a good lad.
Good.
Hey, Roy. You comin' to the club tonight?
Hold on, will you be there?
Of course, bruv.
Then fuck no.
Colin, Isaac, come here.
You know how you two are always messing with Nate?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Keep it up. Makes me laugh.
Good morning, Higgins.
Good morning. I was just-- Waiting at the entrance so I'd see you were here on time.
Exactly. You seem in good spirits.
Yes, I am. I've just realized something.
Who cares if we can't run that picture?
The bigger issue is that the local community is getting behind the team no matter how badly they play.
It is an outstanding fan base.
Yes, one I believe I can put an end to.
Hooray.
No.
Okay. I'll go back there.
Here you go.
Thank you.
So, I spoke to the owner of <i>The Sun</i>.
You spoke to God?
No, the newspaper.
Oh, right.
And he has agreed to not run the photo of you and Keeley.
MVP! MVP! MVP!
Left leg! Right leg, not as good!
Okay.
Yeah!
Yes. Okay, thank you, Ted.
Sorry. Yeah, no. You were saying. Go ahead.
In exchange, I've agreed for his more reputable newspaper, <i>The Independent</i>, to do a profile on you.
"One-on-One with Coach Lasso." Yeah, okay.
The writer will be Trent Crimm.
And he's very good, and the supporters really listen to him.
Oh, no. I know Trent, yeah. He's a tough cookie.
Really?
Yeah, but that's okay.
You know what you do with tough cookies, don't ya?
No.
Dip 'em in milk.
All right, let's run that new one.
Hey, there he is.
Hello, Coach Ted Lasso from America.
Hello, Trent Crimm from <i>The Independent</i>.
Hey, excited to spend the day with ya. Gonna be fun.
And please, call me Ted.
All right, let's go!
Wide open.
Yeah!
Snuck it by him.
Thataway, Sammy. How'd that feel?
Oh, wonderful, Coach. I felt that one in my penis.
Yeah. No, that sounds about right. That's good. Yeah.
Hey, Jamie, you gotta sell that run-through hard, baby.
Make the defense believe you. Watch, like this.
Ball! Ball! Give me the ball!
I want the ball! Give me the ball! I would like the ball, please!
Make it a performance.
I want you winning an Oscar at the ESPYs next year.
You want me to run decoy?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a joke.
Unfortunately for you, though, no one thinks it's funny.
That true?
Agree to disagree. I find it hilarious.
I thought it was funnier than <i>Step Brothers</i>.
High praise.
That scene where the bunk bed collapses...
I used to think that was the funniest thing I'd ever seen, but then I just saw that.
And now I'm gonna have to rethink my order of what I think is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
Yeah, that's when sports and art combine, as far as I'm concerned.
All right, fellas, let's run it again. Let's go.
Cheers.
Yeah, they're getting it. They're getting it.
Interesting play, Ted. Did you come up with this?
Oh, no, no, no.
This is all cooked up by our very own Nate the Great.
Who's "Nate the Great"?
Oh, yeah. There he is.
Someone's been walking their dog here. Found another poo.
Okay.
What exactly does "Nate the Great" do?
I'm not exactly sure what his title is.
Hey, Coach. What is Nate's job around here?
Kit man.
There you go. Kit man.
Do you mean to tell me you're entrusting a Premier League team's attack to the kit man?
That young fellow's forgotten more about this sport than I'll ever know.
Heck, might be a genius.
Anything to add, Coach?
Good kid.
Boy, oh boy.
If you knew Coach Beard, you'd know what a big deal that was.
You mean that, don't you?
Well, hell. There's your story right there.
Got a headline and everything. "Man Nods Head." Watch your back, Gay Talese.
There's a new iconic profile about to be typed up by one Trent Crimm.
Tighten up those lines!
Let 'em know, Coach.
Come on.
Get a towel.
Oh, God. No, no, no.
Get a towel.
Let go. Please, God. Stop it. No.
Oi, oi!
What the fuck are you doing?
Jamie not talk to you about leaving him alone?
Fuck's sake.
You look like you've forgotten something.
Hi, Keeley.
I'm looking for your prick boyfriend. You know how to pick 'em, don't ya?
Didn't your last girlfriend steal your Rolex and sell it for drug money?
So? I don't need a phone and a watch.
Look, I didn't sign up to be your boyfriend's minder, okay?
But the new gaffer's trying to make me feel responsible for fucking Nate, whose last name I don't even know.
It's Barnes.
No. It's Shelley.
Yeah, I know.
I don't like being tricked.
Not by you and not by, "Howdy y'all, cowboys.
My name is Ted Lasso and I'm from Kansas." Wow, you're, like, really, really bad at impressions, man.
I know he's trying to push my buttons, but I cannot be manipulated.
Come on. I could push all of your buttons right now if I wanted to.
No, you couldn't, Keeley-- I think, actually, I could.
You couldn't, Keeley-- No, Keeley.
What was that? I can't seem to hear you.
Keeley, if you would listen to me-- I'm trying to listen to you.
I could tell you why-- So tell me.
Is that making you mad?
No.
"I'm Roy Kent and I get paid to play a game, but I'm mad all the time." That's actually pretty good.
Hey, Trent.
You know who you remind me of right now?
No. Who?
One of them robot vacuums.
Just kinda wandering around looking for dirt.
Roomba.
That's the one.
Actually, I have a question.
After your resounding loss to Crystal Palace, one of your players said there was a party in the locker room.
Do you feel it sends the right message having a party after a loss?
Well, Trent, I've never really concerned myself too much with wins and losses.
Now that's a quote I'll probably use.
You should get going.
Hey, will you let Roy know we're heading out soon?
Copy.
Thanks, Coach.
You wanna tag along? We're gonna go speak to some schoolkids.
Oh, what a coincidence.
The day of our interview you just happen to be visiting a local school.
Well, that's the funny thing about coincidences, ain't it?
Sometimes they just happen.
Come on now.
Come in.
I just wanted to come and thank you again for stopping that picture from running.
And I bought you a present.
Made me think of you.
It's strong and a bit prickly.
You know, I've decided to not be scared of you anymore.
I didn't know you were.
Yeah. I was, like, fucking terrified of you.
My God, Jamie would have been so pissed off with reporters poking around in our love life.
I don't know why I'm telling you. You know all about that, don't you?
Remember when you got divorced?
It rings a bell.
Yeah, I mean, didn't it, like, make you really mad that they went after you and not Rupert?
'Cause he was the one that cheated and he came across like Prince Charming.
It really pissed me off.
Well, the press are never awful to men.
No one ever pays a fortune for a photo of a naked man on a yacht in Mallorca a week after his divorce.
That's like a very specific scenario.
Oh, my God. That means there's a picture of you naked on a yacht.
Can I see it? Is it here?
Come on. You wouldn't have said something if you weren't dying to show someone.
Please.
It was taken from a helicopter while I was sunbathing.
Holy shit, Rebecca.
Are those your real tits?
I feel like a teenage boy. I can't stop staring at them.
Where did you get those?
My mum.
I can't believe you stopped this from running.
I would have shown everyone.
Right. I really need to get on.
Oh, sorry. Yeah.
Thank you.
Bye.
Shoes.
Shoes. Yes.
Wow, you really blew my brains out with those beautiful breasts of yours, Rebecca.
When I first saw our school football squad, I didn't think that Richmond Primary would win a single game, much less the league championship.
To celebrate, please welcome the new manager of AFC Richmond, Ed Lasso.
Thank you. I appreciate you.
All right. Hey, gang. How y'all doing?
Wanker.
Jacob.
It's all right.
Look, I just wanted to come down and congratulate y'all on a heck of a season.
But hey, I know someone else who's really excited to meet all of ya.
So if you please help me welcome the captain of your AFC Richmond squad, Roy Kent.
Roy! Roy! Roy! Roy!
Right.
Never been much for public speaking or school, really.
Always seemed like a waste of time to me.
Why don't we get out of this stuffy auditorium, go out on the pitch and have a proper fuck-about?
I think it's really cool you do this.
Only doing it 'cause my fucking niece goes here.
Oh, yeah? Which one is she?
That idiot.
Oh boy, here she comes.
Can we do headers, Uncle Roy?
Yeah, all right. Come on then.
All right. Come on, you lot. Line up.
Heads. Lovely.
Next. Go. Perfect.
Next. Heads.
Next.
Well done. Next.
Next. Sweet.
Lovely. I liked it.
Good.
Roy, come on.
You hop in there, show 'em how it's done. I'll do a couple.
How you doing? Ready? Come on.
That's the spot. Come on.
Here we go, Phoebe. Let's see what you got.
Hey, nice catch. We might have ourselves a goalie.
Boy, oh boy. That was right in the button.
Good job, Phoebe.
Oh boy.
Sorry about the blood there.
There you go.
Don't use it to clone me.
Nice meeting you. Take care now.
That's the longest anyone's ever stayed for something like this.
Hey, thanks for having us.
Cheers.
Thanks again.
Roy, that was a blast.
And I tell you what, that niece of yours is a real cutie patootie.
Enough. I've had it with your mind games and your stupid gifts.
I mean, what even is <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>?
It's a lovely novel.
It's the story of a young girl's struggle with the burden of leadership as she journeys through space.
Yeah. That's it.
Am I supposed to be the little girl?
I'd like you to be.
Right. None of this matters.
'Cause I'm just doing what everyone in this town is doing, and I'm counting down the days until you're gone.
Trent, you're a colossal prick. You always have been.
Phoebe, come on.
Are you hungry?
Little tradition.
Let battle commence.
Ted Lasso?
Hey there, Ollie.
Leave it out. What are you doing here?
Well, I mean, you invited me, remember?
I invite every person who's been in my car.
Hey, Ollie. This is my friend Trent.
Trent, this is my buddy Ollie.
Pleased to meet you.
Congrats. You both just met a cool person.
Right, gentlemen. You know what you're having?
Yeah. Well, you know, whatever the chef recommends.
That would be my father-in-law. Are you okay with a little bit of spice?
Have him make it for us like we're a couple members of the family.
You're a brave man.
Oh, man. Mad respect.
That might not be the wisest of choices.
Here you go, boys.
Dig in.
Can't wait.
The smell's already deep inside my brain.
Gonna love it.
I appreciate it.
I can't imagine they have good Indian food in Kansas.
I have no idea. I've never had Indian food.
Wow, that-- I mean, that's hot.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Feel like I'm about to breathe fire.
I don't think I can eat that.
What? No, no, no. Come on now. We gotta put a decent dent in this, otherwise we're gonna embarrass Ollie in front of his family.
No, really, I can't.
Come on, just dump it on my plate.
Yeah, yeah. You're good.
So, if you love Kansas so much, why did you-- Why did you leave to coach a sport you can barely-- you know anything about?
Was it just the money?
Wait, I'm supposed to be getting paid?
Are you enjoying the food?
Tell your father-in-law it's perfect.
Dad! He says it's perfect!
Ted. What you're doing is irresponsible.
This club actually means something to this town.
I know that.
I do.
Trent, what do you love?
Is it writing?
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, good, 'cause you're darn good at it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Me? I love coaching.
Now, I'm gonna say this again just so you didn't think it was a mistake the first time I said it.
For me, success is not about the wins and losses.
It's about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves on and off the field.
And it ain't always easy, Trent, but neither is growing up without someone believing in you.
Let me ask you this.
Is my tongue still in my mouth?
'Cause I am about to hallucinate from all the heat here.
I really should go.
Deadlines and all.
Hey, gotta do the work.
Hey, I'll say this though.
I really enjoyed getting to spend this time with you, Trent.
You actually mean that, don't you?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You all right?
Normally, one dish is plenty, but we know how you Americans like to eat, innit?
Let's do it, huh?
Try that one.
Beautiful, right?
It's beyond beautiful. It's hot.
"Mrs. Which's voice was grave.
'What do you understand?' 'That it has to be me.
Can't be anyone else.'" Fuck!
That's a bad word, Uncle Roy.
Mind your own business, Phoebe.
Be good.
Yes?
I have an advance copy of the article.
Read it to me.
Title: "Wayward Ted." <i>"Whatever you think of Ted Lasso as a football coach,</i> <i>I assure you, the truth is harder to swallow."</i> Hey, how you doing?
Good. How's your nose, Coach?
It's fine. Thank you for asking.
<i>"And swallow you must,</i> <i>because Ted is out there in the community</i> <i>either bravely or stupidly facing the music."</i> Hey, fellas. How you doing?
<i>"That's for you to decide."</i> Piss off, wanker!
Hi.
Yeah.
Stop it.
Every time.
<i>"And yes, he's in over his head.</i> <i>He insisted twice that he didn't care if Richmond won or lost.</i> <i>But if the Lasso way is wrong, it's hard to imagine being right."</i> Why have you stopped reading?
Please do me the favor of remembering that these aren't my words, it's Trent Crimm.
Keep going.
"In a business that celebrates ego, <i>... celebrates ego,</i> Ted reins his in." <i>Ted reins his in.</i> <i>His coaching style is subtle. It never hits you over the head.</i> Hello, Roy. I didn't know it was a retirement party.
Shit!
Stop messing with Nate!
Now, I don't know which one of you I nutted, 'cause I don't see so well at night anymore, but that goes for all of you!
<i>Slowly growing until you can no longer ignore its presence.</i> Vanilla vodka.
Such a child.
Keeley.
Roy.
<i>Whether that means allowing followers to become leaders,</i> <i>or in a show of respect, eating food so spicy</i> <i>it's sure to wreak massive havoc on his intestinal system.</i> Keys, keys, keys.
Okay, here we go. Oh boy. Oh boy.
<i>And though I believe that Ted Lasso will fail here</i> <i>and Richmond will suffer the embarrassment of relegation,</i> <i>I won't gloat when it happens.</i> <i>Because I can't help but root for him.</i> Fuck!
 @@@@@@
<i>You're hearing AFC Richmond being booed lustily by their home fans,</i> <i>and you have to say, not without good reason.</i> 2-0. We're better than that!
Jamie. Jamie. Sorry, I didn't put that cross where you wanted it.
Forget it, mate.
Hey, would it be too forward if I gave you some advice that might help improve your game a bit?
No. Please, anything.
What you need to do is get yourself a time machine, and go back to the moment when your mom was about to fuck a sad little man with no athletic talent.
Pull her off him, fly her to Argentina, and drop her onto Maradona's cock.
Hope that helps, mate.
Right, that's it.
I'm done with you being a prick to everyone.
So, either I beat up an old man, or I let an old man beat me up.
Fuck it. Let's go.
Fucking-- Hey, hey, hey!
Easy, easy, easy now!
Coach, tell these boys what the first rule of my fight club is.
No fight club!
No fight club. Okay? You understand?
For the love of Pistol Pete, y'all. We still got a second half to play.
Now, please, sit down. Everybody.
Gaffer saved you, old man.
Call me old...
one more time.
Sorry...
granddad.
I'll fucking kill you!
Table four is done and shall from now on be known as the boring table.
But that's where I'm sitting.
I haven't placed Elaine Kenner. Awful woman.
She won't be attending tonight. She was kicked in the face by her horse.
That poor thing. Is the horse okay?
Looks like we still got ourselves a team divided here.
Coach, you know what I'm thinkin' about right now?
<i>West Side Story</i>?
You know it. Sharks and Jets.
You think these fellas could solve their problems with a dance-off at a gymnasium?
Course, if memory serves, Riff and Bernardo ended up getting knifed to death at that particular event.
No, they didn't die until the rumble afterwards.
Right. Right, right, right.
When I was 15, I was understudy for Anita.
All-boys school.
We have peeled yet another juicy layer of the Nathan onion.
Coach Beard!
For dinner tonight, it's either chicken or steak!
You can't tick both!
Okay!
Busted.
And Ted!
Yeah!
I need to know who your plus-one is!
Well, that'd be Mr. Two Entrées here.
No, he's already bringing a date!
Hey, you free tonight?
I'm free every night, yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna bring Nathan!
Who?
Nate the Great! He's gonna be my date!
And for obvious reasons, we'd love to be at table eight!
No!
And Beard, you're having chicken!
Hey, boss.
Pajama Friday? Wish I woulda known.
You're gonna get a kick outta this story.
When I was 17-- Ted, let me just stop you there before you tell me a folksy anecdote about you and pajamas.
Okay. When you change your mind, just let me know, 'cause this one is a doozy.
Sorry, was there anything you needed? 'Cause I'm really-- I was wondering if me, Roy and Jamie could all sit at the same table tonight.
Is that possible?
Yes.
Great! 'Cause I got some fences I need to mend, and I think that might do the trick.
Ted, I just said yes.
Right.
Oh, God, that one's absolutely beautiful, but...
I don't think I can get away with that anymore.
Sure you could. Fashion's all about confidence.
If I didn't have any confidence, I never would've worn pajamas to my prom and ended up in jail the rest of that night.
But you don't wanna hear that story, so I ain't gonna tell it.
You know what? I'll get outta your hair.
You're probably all revved up because of the big shindig, right?
No, no, no. I'm absolutely fine.
I mean, even when Rupert and I were running the gala together, I did most of the work myself.
So, I'm not revved up at all.
I'm actually, really, feeling quite mellow.
Good afternoon. We have a huge problem.
Our musical guest, Robbie Williams, has canceled.
God!
Oh, no. Who is that?
No, no, no. That's absolutely fine. It's not a problem. Let me just think.
All right, here's what we're going to do, Higgins.
Tonight, when I tell everyone that Robbie has canceled, by then it won't matter because you will have found someone better.
There ya are.
Right.
I am a world-class problem solver.
There it is. You got it. Catch it! Yep! Look at that!
You got this, Higgins!
And Rebecca's grateful for all your hard work!
Thank you, Ted!
No. I hate it, babe.
It's just not me. There's no hood, no zips.
There's no graffiti.
No graffiti.
Mad. I look like a banker.
Not with trousers that tight around the crotch, you don't.
Fine. I look like a banker with a great cock.
Babe, if those existed, we wouldn't be together.
Whatever.
Okay.
Look, you're gonna get more endorsements when you start embracing high fashion.
I'm just trying to help build up your brand.
Jamie, no. What are you doing?
I'm doing...
style.
Yeah, people don't know it, but I'm good at this fashion shit.
Are you?
Yeah, I'm like a progeny.
Oh, yeah?
Oi. Down, boy.
That's a good boy. Find the treat, yeah.
Hey, hon.
Shoot, I was hoping I'd catch ya. Got your message.
Playing a little phone tag, it appears. And you are now it.
Hey. Guess what.
I'm wearing the suit you told me I should bring.
You were right, as always.
Yeah. Okay, so, that's it. I love-- I miss ya.
And just go ahead and give the little guy a squeeze for me.
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
Hey. All right, now.
Gotta love a troubadour.
Here we go.
Holy moly, look at you.
Hope I'm not too early.
No.
Or too late. I was trying to go for somewhere in between.
Yeah, no. You threaded that needle perfectly, Nate.
Good.
Yeah, nailed it.
Hey, let me ask you something.
Are you one of those guys that likes it if your friends tell you you got a piece of food in your teeth?
Absolutely, yeah.
Okay, good. 'Cause that suit does not fit at all.
Really?
Yeah.
I was gonna buy one, but, you know, they're so expensive.
I just thought I'd borrow my dad's.
I hear ya.
Hey. We'll make a little pit stop. Come on, follow me.
Yeah.
What you lookin' at?
You boys all right? How's my suit? All good? Yeah?
This is great.
Hey, thank you, guys, so much for taking my picture.
What are your names?
So you're Jerry, and you're Dave.
What you all came for.
Left eyebrow. Right eyebrow.
Confused look.
Yeah, now for the one that you'll actually use.
That's it, darling. How about a kiss?
Romance is not dead.
Guys, sorry, sorry. I just-- Gonna let them take a picture.
Yeah. Yeah.
I just need to get inside. Okay.
Rebecca, over here!
Nice, ladies.
Rebecca, over here!
You look perfect.
Now, look to your left.
I hate this part.
Miss Welton.
Lovely. Nice.
Hey.
Just put one foot in front of the other, yeah?
And then put your hand on your hip and make, like, a claw shape.
It's the most flattering.
Rebecca, give us a smile.
Rebecca!
Look at her. She's fucking fit!
Don't strut. Let the suit do the work.
Ted Lasso. My God.
Right back at ya, boss.
I had a hunch you were gonna pick this dress.
And may I say, you are wearing the heck out of it.
Thank you.
Check out Nate. Looking pretty dapper himself, huh?
Great to see you again.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
If you'll both excuse me.
Absolutely, yeah. Go do your thing.
Look, there's Beard over there.
That's his new gal, Jane.
Yeah, they met at his Friday night chess club.
Apparently, they liked each other's moves.
That wasn't a joke.
Was it not?
I guess it kinda was.
No. No. Fuck off. Fuck you. No. No.
Yeah, I know.
This is gonna be so uncomfortable.
I'm switching tables.
No, no, no. Hey. Come on back here.
This is my doing.
I parent trapped y'all. Take a seat.
Now, listen. You two knuckleheads have split our locker room in half.
And when it comes to locker rooms, I like 'em just like my mother's bathing suits.
I only wanna see 'em in one piece, you hear?
So we're fixing this.
Tell me what's the biggest issue you got with each other. Go.
He's a piece of shit.
If his brain was on fire, I wouldn't piss in his ear.
Well, hey. You don't need to be best friends to be great teammates.
Think about Shaq and Kobe, right? Lennon and McCartney.
Heck, even Woody and Buzz got under each other's plastic.
Wasn't Woody made out of cloth?
I appreciate you, Nate, but now's not the time.
You know what all those dynamic duos had in common?
Mutual respect.
Y'all gotta find some common ground. So who wants to get the ball rollin'?
I do.
Nate, that's a very nice suit. I think you look chic.
Thank you. It's actually only the second suit I've ever owned.
The first one was my suit when I was a naked baby.
Sorry, it's funny when Ted says it. I-- Well, the term "birthday suit" woulda helped you a ton there, yeah.
Oh, God, yeah.
Come on, let's try this again, all right? Hey, Jamie. You wanna go?
Pass.
Roy.
He's a piece of shit.
You're gonna stick with that, huh? Okay.
Here's an idea that's gonna help a little or hurt a whole lot.
Who needs a drink?
Any progress with the musical guest?
I've talked to a number of agents and made a fairly extensive list of those who cannot make it.
Process of elimination. We're on our way.
Hey, there she is.
You're working on your speech, huh?
Rupert was always very good at the public speaking part.
Hey, here's a little trick of the trade.
Just make fun of yourself right off the bat, a little joke.
Folks will love that.
Okay, so, what should I make fun of myself about?
Right, right, right.
You know-- You know what would be-- No. Okay.
You're not gonna walk into that one, are you, Ted?
No, ma'am. Nope, nope, nope. Okay.
Good luck though.
You know what? I thought of something. No, no, no.
Queen to rook four.
Wait, are y'all playing a game without a board?
Sorry to interrupt. My fault. Sorry. Carry on.
Knight to king five.
Good evening, and welcome to the Tenth Annual Benefit for Underprivileged Children.
If I could hug each of you as a thank you for your kind donations, well...
I probably wouldn't because, as we all know, I'm not much of a hugger.
Now, I do hope you've all brought your checkbooks with you for our auction later.
Because you can all bid on our very own Richmond players.
Same rule as always, no hanky-panky unless the player signs a waiver.
Rupert?
Hello, darling.
What a... lovely surprise.
Weren't you expecting me?
Only 'cause you RSVP'd no.
Well, one of the perks of being a wealthy good-for-nothing.
Sometimes my nights just magically free up.
May I? Thank you.
Gals and gents, with your help, we raised £800,000 last year.
And this year, hopefully even more.
Well, I know I'm crashing your party, but I so badly wanna help.
My fingers and toes are crossed that you will have me.
Of course.
Let's get him a seat at the boring table.
Only joking.
Table four. Rupert Mannion, everyone.
Thanks, doll.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
That-- Nathe, Nathe, Nathe. Come on.
Look, guys, this is a brand-new suit.
Rather than messing with me tonight, can you just get me two times tomorrow?
Roy said we're not allowed anymore.
He fucking headbutted me. I'm still dizzy half the time.
The doctors told me not to drink.
Shit.
Yet another reason shirts exist.
Shut up, it's not funny. Burned my nipple.
I wish I was that ice cube.
I will be bidding for a night with you.
Thanks, love.
Yeah, it's just a date though. It's not a whole night. So...
We'll see.
Mate, I've done these before.
If she bids over 3,000, you will have to fuck her.
Is that true?
You don't have to go all the way.
Just, like, some of the way.
Fingering.
Fuck you. Fuck this table.
Jamie, it was a joke.
It was a joke. Jamie.
What happened now?
Just the usual. Jamie being a little bitch prima donna.
Roy, let me ask you something.
What were you like when you were 23?
Playing in this league, making all that money.
Little bitch prima donna.
Yeah.
You know how they say that "youth is wasted on the young"?
Well, I say don't let the wisdom of age be wasted on you.
Ted?
I just came up with that. I feel pretty good about it.
I just wanted to say thanks for talking to Colin and Isaac.
Why is your face so close to mine?
Well, my initial plan was to hug you, but I just chickened out just now.
Right.
Okay, we're done.
Yeah.
Ted, I'd like to introduce you to Rupert Mannion.
Mr. Mannion, how are you?
It's Rupert, Ted.
Especially for the man who's managing my club.
Used to be your club.
Of course, of course, but... it's still my club in here, love.
Love of a sports team is a lifetime obsession.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Kinda like your best friend's older sister, right?
Hey, but do me a favor.
If you're ever in Kansas City and come across a fella named Tom Dineen, don't tell him I said that.
I love that.
I don't love our last two losses though.
Horrible showing.
Yeah.
Had to say it, wish I didn't.
It's okay. Who knows? Maybe we'll turn it around, huh?
Oh, my God. I believe you.
Do you believe him?
Night's gonna take a turn for the worse if you say no.
Of course I believe in Ted.
He's exactly what we've needed.
Not too much champagne now, dear.
Gotta stay sharp for the auction.
Why don't you do the auction?
No, I couldn't. This is your night.
We both know they'd rather see you.
And besides, it's... for the children.
For the children.
Right. If you'll excuse me, I need to speak to the other guests.
I must say, I love that dress.
It's very youthful.
Good for you for getting back out there looking like that.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Ted.
It's been a hard year for her. Is she okay?
Yeah, she's great.
You know, a lot of moving pieces putting together a thing like this though.
And then she had this fella... Robbie Williams cancel on her and-- Robbie?
Yeah.
Well, he's an old pal of mine.
I'm happy to text him. I bet you I can get his ass over here.
I bet she'd love it.
I'll go track her down and run it up the flagpole, huh?
I'm sorry. That's an expression from back home.
Just means I'm gonna ask her.
Fabulous. Showtime.
All right, go get 'em.
Can I get something stronger, like a Jack on the rocks or something?
A double and a single in one. A triple.
Ladies and gentlemen, slight change in plans.
I have been cajoled into being your auctioneer for this evening.
And our first victim is Jamie Tartt.
Babe, you have to win me.
I can't bid on my own boyfriend. I'll look pathetic.
Babe, it's 2020. Women can do anything.
No, it's not happening. Come on, you look hot. Go up there!
Look at him, folks. Young, gorgeous, charming. The bastard.
So, we'll start with £5,000.
I want him, Rupert.
Five thousand from Cheryl Barnaby.
Richmond's premier breeder of Shetland ponies.
Do we hear six?
Six thousand.
Six. Thank you.
Seven thousand.
Seven thousand.
Ten thousand.
Stunning.
And that applies to the bid and the bidder.
I don't think so.
Twelve thousand pounds.
Fourteen thousand.
Fourteen thousand!
Sixteen thousand.
Eighteen.
Eighteen thousand. Do I hear any advance?
Yeah. Twenty-five thousand.
Twenty-five thousand! Going once. Twice.
Sold to Keeley Jones.
Why spend the time with your boyfriend for free when you can have him for 25 grand?
You owe me.
Hey. There you are. Getting a little fresh air, huh?
Yeah. Those rickshaw bike things are so silly, but they do look like fun.
Yeah.
You ever been on one?
No, ma'am.
My wife and I once rented one of those tandem bikes on vacation a while back.
Not the best experience. She broke her arm and I actually...
Well, I chipped a tooth, and I bruised my perineum.
Hey, you okay?
It's just...
That man, he knows me.
I used to think his blunt honesty was noble rather than what it really is.
Which is just...
the cruelest way of hiding his own insecurities.
He'd say wear this, eat that.
And I listened.
But now I'm alone.
I'm alone, Ted. Just like he said I would be if I left.
I don't want to be alone.
Hey. It's okay. Okay.
You wanna hop on this thing and get the heck outta Dodge? Come on.
I wish.
Not right now. Thank you though.
Has he started the auction?
Yeah, yeah.
Good. I'm glad he's done that. We'll get much more money.
No matter what he does, they just love him.
You wanna head back in?
No, you go ahead.
I need to freshen up.
I probably look like Robert Smith after he's woken up from a nap.
Very emotional man. Yeah.
Okay, I'll see you inside.
When I was coming up, there was this old geezer at the club, Doug Stashwick.
He was always on me. Hated each other.
You wanna know how we won the league?
No.
It was the same shit Yankee Doodle was peddling.
He sat me down and he said, "Let's get it all out there.
You tell me why I'm a prick, and I'll tell you why you are." You're a nasty bastard-- No, I'm going first.
Even though I know I should pass to you...
you're so selfish and arrogant.
Every time I do, it makes me want to fucking puke.
You know, I had a poster of you on my wall when I was a kid.
Used to love watching you play.
But you're not the player that you used to be, and just because you won a few trophies, you walk around here expecting everyone to kiss your ring.
Yeah, I can be like that.
Now's the bit where you admit to what I said.
I don't wanna.
Even if it is just...
a little bit true.
You and that Doug bloke, you ever become friends?
Fuck no. I hope he's dead.
To you dying.
Such a prick.
Howdy, partner.
So, you ask Rebecca what she thought about texting Robbie?
You know what? I couldn't find her. I say don't worry about it.
If you change your mind, say the word and-- sent.
He'll be right over. Top up.
Hey, Rupert, something just occurred to me.
If you could've texted Robbie Williams asking him to come tonight...
you could've probably just as easily asked him not to come.
Well, now, that would've made me a real piece of shit, wouldn't it?
Hey, Ted. Do you think Rebecca knows what the real Adele looks like?
I need to go on a little adventure, and I need a copilot.
And you want me?
Yeah. Forget the rest, I need the best.
Come on, follow me.
Thank you, by the way.
Huh?
The red carpet photos are already online, and I actually look all right for once.
Glad to help.
Keeley?
I think you should know that the young woman that was bidding on Jamie was actually his other plus-one.
Cheeky little prick.
Can I have a sip of your drink?
Yes.
Thanks.
In anything else, I hate olives.
I think the little, like, orange clitoris thing is really freaky.
Have you ever dated a footballer?
What?
Sorry.
I shouldn't laugh. It sounds... judgy.
No, it's okay. You are a bit judgy.
So when I was 18, I dated a footballer that was 23.
Now I'm close to 30, and I am still dating a 23-year-old footballer.
I'm Leonardo DiCaprio.
They are pretty fun though.
Simple, rich, fit.
What about accountable?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, everyone makes mistakes, but...
I was married to a man for 12 years who never once took responsibility for any single one of them.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Keeley.
Hi, I'm Bex.
Really nice to meet you, Bex.
Nice to meet you.
Do you mind if I just have a minute on my own with this one?
Yeah, sure. Lovely to meet you.
She your new girlfriend?
Relax, babe. It's all part of the branding plan, innit?
If I've got two women bidding on me, it makes me look more valuable.
Do you know what I mean?
It's fucking smart, eh?
And now, the only former Champions League winner on the menu, say hello to Roy Kent.
Granddad.
And the highest bidder gets to spend a day at a swanky hotel by the pool drinking frozen daiquiris and soaking up the rays-- No, we said there's no daiquiris and no rays.
There's not gonna be a fucking pool either. We're not leaving SW14.
You looked so jealous. It was so cool.
You think jealousy is cool, do you?
Don't know, babe. I don't get jealous.
Well, can we have 100 quid for what's turning out to be a very boring date?
All right. A thousand pounds.
Any advances on that?
Two thousand pounds!
Cheryl's got fire inside her.
Three thousand pounds.
Babe, you're just embarrassing yourself.
Four thousand pounds!
Five thousand!
Six thousand pounds.
Any advance on six?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay, sold to Cheryl.
That concludes the auction, apart from one small surprise.
I am personally donating £1 million to the cause.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
And that, I believe, gets Rebecca over her goal of 800,000. Thank you.
For the children, eh?
Rebecca.
This here is Cam Cole. He's an undiscovered mega-talent.
Go on, Cam. Show 'em what you got.
Are you insane?
Hey, Rebecca. You do not wanna judge this book by its cover right here, okay?
The hell with it.
Yes.
Hello again. Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you that...
Robbie Williams is unable to be here tonight due to an emergency.
But we have a brilliant replacement for you who you are just going to love.
Or, at least, have lots to talk about on the way home.
All the way from outside... please welcome Cam something.
Bollocks.
What does that mean?
<i>Mama, sweet mama nature Please forgive us and what we've done</i> Can we just forget about the game and go and have a dance?
Queen to king five. Checkmate.
<i>We've gone and hurt our mama</i> <i>And her wrath has begun</i> <i>'Cause I'm a good boy to my mama</i> <i>But</i> <i>I've got bad siblings</i> Thank you so much.
You're so welcome.
We really had a great time.
Thank you so much.
Good night.
Thank you again for such an unbelievable donation.
See you again next year.
Can't wait.
What a charmer, huh?
Indeed.
You may think that you're the only one that can see who he really is...
but you're not.
Oh, boy. You all right, buddy?
Quick.
All right.
Fun night.
Hey, wait, hold on. Slow down, Coach.
Will you stop being mad at me now?
I'm sorry, babe.
Do you even know what you're sorry for, Jamie?
You always ask me that.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't use me as a prop in your little fights.
Made me feel like an idiot.
I'm sorry. I-- I shouldn't have done that.
Thanks.
No one was bidding on you anyway, mate. Just fuck off.
Go on.
What are you saying sorry to him for?
Being accountable matters, Jamie.
We're done.
I'll see you around.
Whatever.
Excuse me, can I take these?
Two?
Do you wanna go get, like, really drunk?
Yes, I do.
Then we can go rob a bank or something.
Michelle and Henry are coming out next weekend.
Hey, that's great, Coach.
Yeah.
So come on, tell me about you and Jane. What happened?
I did it again.
Put the game before the dame, huh?
Yup.
When are you gonna learn, Coach?
 @@@@@@
I'm sorry about this.
Don't you dare apologize. Thanks to you, we can afford to get the other car fixed.
Tell him, boys.
Bye, Dad.
It's all right, Dad.
Whatever.
Love you.
Love you, darling.
And tell your boss I hope she gets heart disease.
Morning, Ted.
Hey, Higgins-- Is he dead?
I mean, you know, it's my fault for staring at my phone.
I just can't stop checking on my family's flight.
You know, I haven't shared this with too many folks, but Michelle and I, we've been having some marital issues.
Ted, you really don't have to talk about this if you don't want to.
I don't mind.
Tried couples therapy.
Didn't like the other couple though.
It feels good to laugh.
Yeah, you know, our therapist gave us this code word to use.
So if either of us says "Oklahoma," the other one has to tell the God's honest truth.
Yeah, you know, it's pretty helpful.
Did ruin the musical for me though.
So now every time I hear, "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'," or... what-- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top," or-- "Shall We Dance?" No, that's from <i>King and I</i>.
Anyway, if I hear any of those tunes, I immediately think about my wife telling me that my constant optimism is too much.
And this... sharing of feelings is 'cause I opened up to you about my ex-husband at the gala.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, that's a lesson learned.
Come on now.
I bet deep down you kinda dig we're getting so close, right?
I do.
Oklahoma?
I do not.
Jamie?
You up?
Hello?
Is Jamie here?
Oh, my God. You're Keeley Jones.
Yeah, I am.
Hi, Jamie.
No, no. No. You can't get mad. You broke up with me.
Like, 24 hours ago.
How long's a man meant to be alone?
What am I supposed to do? Shower by myself?
Sorry, can I just say, I'm your biggest fan.
I follow your Insta, your Snap, everything.
Wow, thank you.
And, Jamie, thank you.
Whenever I break up with someone, I spend months questioning it, wondering if I made a huge fucking mistake.
But you have really helped me to feel good about this decision, just by...
being you.
You're welcome.
What?
You said I made you feel good about your decision.
Yeah.
Did you mean it?
Yes.
Well, then you're welcome.
I like to make people feel good.
You still gonna be around for the promo shoot later?
The promo shoot that I've spent weeks setting up for you?
Yes.
It was nice to meet you.
Yes, yes, yes! Here!
Yes, Jamie! Jamie, Jamie!
Jamie, I'm open. Jamie!
What are you doing? That was going in.
Well, we'll never know.
Jamie, how many times I gotta tell you to make the extra pass?
Come on. Sam was more open than the jar of peanut butter on my kitchen counter.
What? What's he talking about?
That's right. Y'all don't know I like to keep the peanut butter open.
That way, whenever I walk by, I can just stick my finger in there.
It's a fucking good idea, to be fair.
Yeah, it is.
Now look, when Sam is that open, you gotta pass to him, okay?
But why? Even when Sam's open, Sam is still shit.
I heard my name. What did he say?
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
Guys, we gotta play like a team tomorrow.
Otherwise we're gonna get our butts kicked. Extra passes.
We're gonna keep doing this until we get it right. Let's go.
Dad!
Practice is canceled.
That is a lot longer run than he thinks, though.
Metaphor.
Hey!
Daddy!
I kinda thought y'all would meet me halfway, but hey, that's all right.
Hey, buddy!
Helicopter!
You got it. Two spins. How about that?
Boy, you're gonna be a dizzy fella there.
Slower helicopter.
No way. Come on now.
I missed you so much.
Group hug.
Hey! There he is.
Hey, big guy. Look how tall you got. What the heck?
And look at this. I mean, you, what-- You got teeth now?
I already had teeth!
And you can talk!
Also, Ms. Welton, sorry to report, but this weekend's match will not be completely sold out.
Not a surprise. We've lost four matches in a row, and we're facing relegation.
But why be sorry?
I think it's all going rather smashingly.
I'm happy to be the new brand ambassador for Darsteiner.
The favorite beer of Jamie Tartt.
Wait, wait, wait. Get my tats.
Get that one. It's very important to me. Chinese for "arm." Jamie.
What?
Just drink the beer.
Yeah.
No judgment, but are you back with that twat?
<i>Bon appétit</i>.
No. We're done. God, I love that you care though.
I'll kiss you on the mouth if I can reach those lips.
You know, I put this whole thing together. I get 10%.
Hey, do you like mythology?
You've seen a unicorn. You ever seen a brewnicorn?
That's fucking funny.
Oh, no.
What's that? It's my beerby.
Come on.
Okay.
Y'all getting all this for free. Not even extra for that.
Keeley.
If any of the other players needed some branding work done, is that something you'd be interested in?
I don't want you to offer me a job just 'cause I was nice to you in the loo the other night.
Why not? Men give each other jobs in toilets all the time.
Yeah, they do.
I meant employment. Like job-jobs.
So not hand, or blow, or foot?
Foot?
You're right. Technically it would be... feet, right?
Just give it a thought. Unless you want to carry on doing-- What is it you do again?
I'm sort of famous for being almost famous.
Excellent.
Maybe think of it as a plan B.
Yeah.
Okay, now, little tip for y'all, all right?
Fries are called "chips." Chips are called "crisps." And "bangers" aren't great songs, but they do make you feel like dancing 'cause they're so darn tasty.
When you gonna win a game, you fucking wanker?
Hey, Baz. Fellas. This here-- This is my wife, Michelle.
Absolute pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Lasso.
Nice recovery. Well executed.
Yeah, coach's wife. She's heard it all.
Yeah.
Hi, Ted. Hello, young man.
Here are the darts. There's the board. Try not to hit any regulars.
Yeah, go have fun.
Your table's this way.
Go on. After you.
Three fish-and-chips?
Yes, please. And two pints.
I like your style.
Yeah.
Look at this.
Do they wrap the fish-and-chips in newspaper? I read they do that here.
No, no. I wish. Boy, I'd love that. Having my food teach me stuff?
Yeah, that's your dream scenario, right?
A doughnut that knows about Rosa Parks or something.
Yeah. Exactly, yeah.
Yeah.
Can fit a lot of wisdom just in the hole.
Yeah.
You already done, bud?
Yeah, he probably should be.
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Happens all the time.
What are you doing?
I'm just curious, yeah?
The photographer's gonna send me over the pictures, and I'll just kill the ones where you look like shit.
Then I'll send them over to you.
Firstly, babe, there won't be any where I look like shit because...
And B, why don't you just bring them over to my place and we can look at them together?
Maybe we're naked.
Hard no. Thank you again, Jamie.
Smart move.
Excuse me?
I have to hang out with that prick.
The fact that you would choose to be with him is frankly mind-blowing.
I'm not with him. We broke up.
We're working together, actually. And who asked you anyway, huh?
Right.
I didn't know that, so... apologies.
No, it's fine. You should definitely weigh in on my life.
I'll make sure that I text you anytime I have to make a decision, yeah?
It's just that in training, Sam was wide open, and Jamie wouldn't pass to him.
But Sam was wide open.
Now that's what I'm dealing with.
Yes.
Here it is.
Yeah. Okay. Now, hold on a second.
Think we might have missed a page. Oh, boy.
Don't you wanna go ride a real double-decker bus?
After we finish.
See? I like that.
First we gotta build it, then we can ride it.
It's kind of a <i>Field of Dreams</i> paradigm.
Okay.
Well, six hands are better than four.
Good morning.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, look at that scarf. I like it.
Oi! Wanker.
Don't you fuck up the match.
I appreciate you. We'll see what happens, huh?
Hey, check it out.
You never-- Never seen one of these before.
That right there, that's a scone, okay?
It's like a muffin, except it sucks all the spit out of your mouth.
There's your breakfast. All right? Hey! What do you say?
Thanks, Dad!
Okay. There you go. Some people's kids, holy moly.
It's pretty nice out there, isn't it?
Yeah.
Hey.
I can make us some breakfast.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'm just a little jet-lagged is all.
I'm fine, Ted.
No, no. No. Michelle, you gotta talk to me.
Okay? Hey, hey. Oklahoma.
Every day...
I wake up hoping that I'll feel the way I felt in the beginning.
But maybe that's just what marriage is, right?
I'll keep trying. You know I will.
Ready to go!
I mean, you're gonna need pants, kiddo.
Yeah.
You know-- Let's get some pants. Come on.
I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Marriage. Just so, you know, so complicated.
So many different challenges and...
I think-- I don't know. Sorry.
You ever been married?
Yeah, Nate. Coach's views on romantic relationships are not too dissimilar from his views on cooking steak.
You know, you spend any more than five minutes on one, loses its flavor.
That sound about right, Coach?
Yeah.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question then?
Fire away.
If you were worried about your relationship, then why did you fly 4,438 miles away?
That is a very specific number to know off the top of your head.
Well, my dad used to be a cartographer.
Used to say I was .001 miles tall.
Yeah. Well, it's a good question. Why do it?
I think at some point I realized that me being around so much was doing more harm than good.
Like, anytime I tried to solve any of her problems, or...
do something sweet for her, it just would backfire.
And then she and this therapist we were working with decided that maybe the best thing to do would be to give her a little space.
And so... well, I gave her 4,400 and...
Thirty-eight.
Thirty-eight miles worth of it.
Sorry to interrupt. I was told one of you had my phone.
Thank heavens.
I deleted some apps to optimize performance.
Not Battleships, I hope.
Oh, well. I was playing that too much anyway.
I'll leave you lads to your match day planning.
Now, well, hold your horse there, amigo.
You mind if I get your take on something?
Wow, of course.
Very exciting to be invited into the inner sanctum.
Team Lasso, as it were.
You and the missus. Y'all been together a while, yeah?
Yes, 28 years.
Five boys, three dogs, one 20-year-old cat whose impending death will wreck me emotionally, and one small house that manages to fit us all in it.
Sounds like a full life right there.
But I assume y'all have had your fair share of hard times though, yeah?
Did you not hear the five boys, tiny house, dying cat part?
That's the thing though, isn't it?
If you're with the right person, even the hard times are easy.
Someone call 911. I want to report a truth bomb.
I think they do 999 here.
It is 999.
Yes. It is, yeah.
For emergencies?
Boy, that seems troublesome to me.
You know, toddlers and, just, butt dials and-- 'Cause it's one key.
Yeah.
You'd probably have police cars and ambulances just zipping all over the place.
Yeah.
Well, that happens a lot, doesn't it?
It does. Yeah, yeah.
That explains it, actually.
There you have it.
<i>Arlo White here with Chris Powell.</i> Live from Nelson Road Stadium, the home of AFC Richmond.
All right, everyone! Get in a fucking circle.
Let's throw this down!
Come on, boys!
Right, hands in.
On three. One, two, three...
Richmond!
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Jamie, you a germophobe?
'Cause I'm trying to think of a reason you didn't put your hand in with the rest of the team.
Didn't want to.
I gotta say, man, sometimes you remind me of my grandma with the channel hopper.
You just push all the wrong buttons.
Well, then how's about you and me make a deal?
Okay, I'm listening.
You get to keep on preaching all of your yeehaw bullshit, and in exchange, I'll keep ignoring you, because this team is tragic.
I score all the goals, and I'm the only one they come to see.
Does that sound fair? Hands in.
You know, I'd love to hash out some of the nuances there, but I'm not having the best of days-- Actually, it doesn't matter what you say.
'Cause in my head, I'm just hearing the crowd cheer my name after I score a goal tonight.
<i>Jamie Tartt... Jamie Tartt...</i> As undeniably catchy as that tune is, I need you to cut the crap right now-- Dad!
Hey, big guy. There he is. Hey.
Jamie Tartt?
Hello, little lad.
Would you sign my shirt?
All right, turn around.
That's pretty cool, huh?
Now, next time I score a goal, it won't just be for me.
It'll be for you too.
And for me. But... just for us.
Cool.
Good lad.
Good boy.
Come on, let's get out there.
<i>Jamie Tartt... Jamie Tartt...</i> Come on, goalie!
<i>Link finds space.</i> <i>He rears back to shoot it.</i> <i>A stunning goal by the Canadian midfielder!</i> Fuck's sake!
I hate that poxy wanker! Fucking Lasso!
Nice family though.
Damn it, Paul! Don't humanize him!
Well, after only six minutes, Richmond are 2-0 down.
Wanker! Wanker!
<i>And the Richmond supporters are making their feelings known.</i> Wanker! Wanker!
<i>Chris, you have to think, if this continues,</i> <i>Lasso's time with Richmond will be short and not very sweet.</i> <i>Tartt receives the ball. Clever there.</i> Go on, Jamie.
<i>He finds space.</i> <i>He has Obisanya on the right.</i> <i>No, he's doing it himself. And what a finish!</i> <i>Jamie Tartt with an incredible solo goal!</i> Jamie Tartt, you fucking king!
<i>Jamie Tartt... Jamie Tartt...</i> <i>And thanks to budding superstar, Jamie Tartt,</i> <i>Richmond are right back in it at 2-1 in the 29th minute!</i> Me!
What's he yelling?
"Me." He's pointing at the name on his back and repeatedly yelling "me." Me!
I thought he was saying "meat." But, yeah, yours makes a lot more sense. Okay.
Come on!
<i>Obisanya joins the attack.</i> <i>The Nigerian is taken out!</i> Bullshit!
Come on, ref! They gotta knock that off!
<i>It'll be a yellow card here for Benson.</i> <i>And you have to say he got off easy there. And Obisanya is still down.</i> He might be hurt.
Yeah.
Excuse me, mate.
Oi! Check on your fucking teammate.
<i>The captain dispensing some wisdom to the young superstar.</i> <i>Nothing wrong with that.</i> Sam?
Yeah?
I'm gonna have to move you there. There you go.
What is your fucking problem?
<i>What is this?</i> <i>Kent and Tartt are at each other's throats!</i> Okay. Hey, guys! Come on! Knock it off!
<i>Hopefully cooler heads will prevail.</i> Fucking kill you!
Same team!
<i>Unacceptable, Arlo.</i> <i>Chris, have you ever struck a teammate?</i> Are you mad? So what?
<i>No, but I've wanted to.</i> He's my own player.
Yeah, yeah.
<i>I'm actually a bit jealous.</i> You gotta be-- <i>We haven't seen this since 2001 in Newcastle.</i> <i>And a season of lows for Richmond sinks even further still.</i> You all right, Sam?
Honestly, it doesn't even hurt anymore.
But everyone was making such a fuss, I thought I should just stay down.
No. Listen.
I'm gonna pull you up, you're gonna pretend to limp very badly, and you're gonna gesture like you think you can bravely go on.
They'll love it.
Okay.
<i>Obisanya is on his feet, but can he continue?</i> Is he okay?
<i>Looks like he'll play through the pain.</i> <i>Such determination. You love to see it.</i> Attaboy, Sam!
<i>Tartt steps up to take the free kick, with an opportunity to tie the game.</i> <i>Will he find a teammate or go for glory?</i> <i>With Tartt, that's usually a rhetorical question.</i> <i>And he's done it!</i> That's two for Jamie Tartt, and Richmond are level in the 38th minute!
<i>He's a special player, Arlo.</i> Look at this.
<i>And you have to wonder, where would Richmond be without him.</i> I'll be right back.
Me! Me!
<i>We certainly haven't seen this before. Ted Lasso is running into the stands.</i> Well, where the hell is he off to?
<i>He's not slowing down on those steps.</i> That's some real impressive cardio from Ted Lasso there.
<i>Is he okay?</i> Hey, Rebecca.
Hello, Ted.
You're doing great, Dad.
Yeah, you got this.
Thanks, guys.
I wanna bench Jamie.
But I didn't wanna do it without checking with you first.
But, Ted, you're the manager.
So whatever you decide, you have my full support.
Thanks, boss. All right. Later, alligators.
Bye, Dad.
<i>And it appears Coach Lasso has decided to rejoin the match already in progress.</i> Roberts, warm up. You're going in. Let's go. Come on.
Hey, highlighter. We got ourselves a sub.
Sixteen's going in for nine. Okay?
Okay.
Appreciate you, sir. Thank you.
Okay.
Well, it looks like Lasso is making an early substitution here.
<i>He's bringing Roberts on, and he's taking off...</i> <i>Jamie Tartt?</i> He's our best player!
Me?
You don't know what you're doing! You don't know what you're doing!
What on earth?
<i>He's taking off his best player.</i> <i>And with less than a minute remaining in the half.</i> Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!
<i>Number 16, Robbie Roberts,</i> <i>for number 9, Jamie Tartt.</i> Hey, way to play out there. Way to get us back in.
Shut up. Fucking stupid twat.
<i>The referee looks at his watch, and that's halftime.</i> <i>What kind of reception awaits Lasso in his locker room?</i> Oi, sit down and listen.
We got ourselves a tied game.
Nice work.
Fellas, we're broken. We need to change.
And, look, I know change can be scary.
One minute, you're playing freeze tag out there at recess with all your buddies.
Next thing you know, you're getting zits, your voice gets low.
And every time your art teacher, Ms. Scanlon, leans over your desk to check and see how your project's going, you feel all squiggly inside.
She was a striking woman. Not classically beautiful, but striking.
First time I ever saw tan lines.
Most of the time, change is a good thing.
Now, I think that's what it's all about.
Embracing change.
Being brave.
Doing whatever you have to, so that everyone in your life...
can move forward with theirs.
'Cause maybe...
it's the only way you can truly help her be happy.
Obviously by "her," I'm referring to Lady Football.
Good save.
Sam, we're gonna shift you to midfield for the second half.
And Beard's gonna walk y'all through the rest of the changes.
Hey, hey, hey. One last thing.
And I want everyone's eyes on me when I say this. Look at me.
Never really liked Tartt.
We know, Roy.
Everybody, come on.
<i>Two minutes of added time remaining.</i> <i>Still level at two goals apiece.</i> <i>Richmond have played well, even without Jamie Tartt.</i> Here we go.
He's open. He's open. He's open. There you go.
<i>A through ball from Cockburn. And Kent is off to the races!</i> Come on!
<i>Kent has only one man to beat.</i> <i>He could take it himself,</i> <i>but he makes the extra pass to a wide open Obisanya!</i> <i>And he buries it!</i> Oh, my God!
<i>Richmond take the lead with barely a minute of stoppage time left.</i> <i>Scorer for Richmond's third goal, number 24, Sam Obisanya.</i> Yeah!
I'm so sorry! I'm just so happy!
No, I love it! I love this energy!
Here, Coach. Take this guy from me.
Yeah!
That's the way you do it!
Nicely done, gentlemen! Nicely done! Way to do it! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Took balls, what you did.
That's all we got is balls, Roy. It's all we got.
All right! Yeah! There you go. Way to play.
How about that, Coach?
You hear that, Coach?
Wanker! Wanker!
Well, same word, ain't it?
Yeah, but different.
Yeah, kinda like back in the '80s when bad meant good, right?
Who was president back then?
Ronald Reagan.
"Ronald Reagan? The actor?" Oh, man. I love it when you do Doc Brown. You walked me right into that.
Daddy! Dad!
Hey! There he is!
How about that, huh? We won one.
Daddy?
Yeah?
What's a wanker?
Well, kiddo. That is a...
That's a man that likes to be alone with his thoughts. Make sense?
Let's give you a better view of all this. Ready?
Get up there, kiddo. Look at that.
Wave to the people. That's it. Let them know. Let them see, huh?
Shit.
Yeah.
One touch.
I just keep thinking about the first time we met, back at school.
Us being the only two people in that big old parking lot at the exact same time.
So random.
No way for us to know that it was going to be the start of something.
Hey.
Did I scare you?
You snuck up on a woman in a parking lot at night.
Yeah, Roy, well done.
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I was also an idiot yesterday, so...
It's okay.
Good night, Keeley.
Good night, Roy.
<i>I look back at everything we've been through,</i> and I wouldn't change a single thing.
Even now.
What are you saying?
Michelle, if there is something I could... do or something I could say that would make you be happy...
just being with me, I'd do it.
I'd do it in a nanosecond.
But I ain't got no control over any of that.
You don't have to keep trying anymore.
It's okay.
I'm gonna be okay. Yeah?
Okay, quick feet. There we go.
Shoot.
I promised myself I would never quit anything in my life.
But you're not quitting, Ted.
You're just letting me go.
Yeah.
Come on.
You ready?
Yeah.
Yes. Thank you.
It's all right.
I appreciate you, Shannon. Thank you.
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna see you the second after the season's over, okay?
And we're gonna talk every day?
Absolutely. Just like we do, big guy. You know it. Okay?
Well, gimme a hug, please. Yeah.
Okay now, okay.
Hey, I love you. Go ahead, get on.
Oi, wanker. Good job tonight.
Thank you, sir.
Keep an eye on us. We might be turning this thing around.
 @@@@@@
Oh, boy.
Morning, fellas. Sorry I'm late.
Just needed to clear my head so I decided to, you know, walk to work.
Turns out that clearing and walking in a town you don't know all too well can be a little tricky.
Ended up getting lost but, you know, then I got unlost, then I got lost again but...
Well, you know, now I'm here, you know. Beard's here, Nate's here, which is great because the world can be a sad, lonely place, but-- Hey, come on now, let's get to work, shall we?
Michelle.
Which is fine.
You know, it's okay, 'cause it's a great time now for me to, you know, bury myself in my work here.
And so-- Although, I'm not crazy-- I don't love the word "bury," you know what I mean?
It's just got a negative connotation to it, don't it?
What's another word I could say?
Everyone loves a good bath, right? Just a nice warm bath, right? Yeah?
So that's what I'll say. I'll say, "I'm gonna bathe myself in work." How 'bout that? That's good. That's good.
Nate, you got a favorite bath bomb, buddy?
No, I just don't really enjoy baths, just 'cause my skin gets really wrinkly, and I'm deeply worried about aging.
Okay, I get that. What about you, Coach? You got a favorite bath bomb?
Crème brûlée honey.
Honey? Is that an ingredient or something you just called me?
Ingredient.
Shoot.
I was hoping it was the other one. But that's kind of a fun idea.
Maybe we start calling each other little pet names.
You know? Like "honey" or "babe," you know?
It might be nice, right? What do you think, Coach?
Nate, will you do me a favor here?
Will you just help Coach plan practice for today?
Absolutely. Yeah.
All right. Thank you, sweetie.
Okay, I'll see y'all in a little bit.
Is he all right?
No.
All right. Shall we? Sarah, why don't you lead us off?
So, Coach Lasso. You finally won your first match.
How's it feel?
Well, Sarah, I believe you can outscore your opponent and still lose.
Just like you can score less than them and win.
But last week we definitely won, which is pretty darn fun.
All right, next question.
Trent Crimm, <i>The Independent</i>.
Is it safe to assume that Jamie Tartt will be back on the pitch next match?
Well, you know what they say when you assume, Trent?
You make an arse outta you and me. Yeah?
And that right there is another example of how our English and y'all's English sometimes do not jive, innit?
But are you honestly gonna keep your best player on the bench?
Well, that depends on Jamie. He knows what we need from him.
Let's keep it going, yeah? Kip, come on, hit me.
Ted. Just the man I wanted to see.
Hey, boss.
Your decision to bench Jamie Tartt was very brave.
Thank you.
I mean, a masterstroke.
I don't think we're allowed to talk like that at work anymore.
There's just one complication now.
Manchester City have called, and they've inquired about terminating Jamie's loan.
They're gonna take his house?
No.
Ted, Jamie's contract is owned by Manchester City, and they, in turn, loaned him to Richmond for the season.
Okay. I get it.
They want Jamie back if you are planning to bench him.
I'm not planning on that. No, my plan is for my plan to work.
But you know what they say about the best-laid plans, right?
Said "plan" too many times. Word's lost all its meaning now.
Plan. Plan. Plan. Doesn't matter.
Hey, you tell Man City that this man has a plan.
Plan. Plan. Plan?
Plan.
Plan?
Not plan.
Plan.
Like "flan." Plan.
Flan? That dessert?
Yes, like "flan." No, I don't dig on flan.
Plan. Plan.
Plan. Plan?
Word become a sound?
What's that called again?
Semantic satiation.
Yeah.
Okay. All right.
Is that new kid from Mexico here yet?
He's getting treatment on his knee.
Okay, good.
What's his name again?
Dani Rojas.
Yeah. It's a great name. Okay.
How's Jamie doing?
What?
Says he can't practice today. Says he's hurt.
Oh, boy.
Hey, Jamie.
I heard you're not gonna be able to run with us today. That true?
Yep.
Why's that?
'Cause I'm hurt.
Really sorry to hear that.
Relax, Ted. It's just practice.
Hey.
If you can't practice, you can't practice.
If you're hurt, you're hurt. It's as simple as that.
But it ain't about that... at all.
You're sitting in here. You're supposed to be the franchise player.
And yet here we are, talking about you missing practice.
We're talking about practice.
You understand me? Practice.
Not a game.
Not a game. Not the game you go out there and die for. Right?
Play every weekend like it's your last, right?
No, we're talking about practice, man.
Practice! You know you're supposed to be out there.
You know you're supposed to lead by example.
You're just shoving that all aside.
And so here we are, Jamie. We're talking about practice.
Not a game.
Not the game.
We're talking about practice, with your team. With your teammates.
The only place we get to play together, we got control over.
Rest of the time it's us 11 against those 11.
We're talking about practice, man!
I'm talking about practice! And you can't do it 'cause you're hurt.
Right?
It's fine by me.
Tell you what. Do me a favor.
When you get out there, set up the cones so the other reserves can do a little passing drill.
You want me to set up cones?
I really appreciate it.
Colin, go set the cones up.
I think he asked you, mate.
Was I talking to you, big man?
Colin, set up the cones.
Isaac's right. He asked you. You are a second-teamer.
That's gotta sting.
Cheers.
I must say, it's quite nice seeing Jamie put in his place for once.
Thrilling even, innit?
No, no, no.
This is a no schadenfreude zone, all right?
<i>Nein schadenfreude.</i> All right.
The new kid, what's his-- Dani what?
Rojas.
Rojas, yeah. Is he any good?
Came here in the summer transfer window, was immediately injured, so no one's really seen him play.
That's okay.
You know, 'cause once Jamie sees someone else playing his position, you know... I mean, it's gonna hurt his soul.
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't be happy about that.
Okay, let's be sure to help Dani get acclimated, all right?
First time in this league can be very overwhelming.
Dani Rojas, Rojas! Dani Rojas!
Rojas, Dani Rojas! Rojas, Rojas, Rojas!
Hey! Hello, coaches.
Thank you for the opportunity.
Yeah. You are a spirited fella, Dani.
Just go on out there, and get the striker spot for us, okay?
Yes! Just like back in Guadalajara, you say it, I do it, Coach.
Football is life!
I like him.
Jamie doesn't.
Chipper dickheads like that can never back it up on the pitch.
Beautiful cross, Sam!
Football is life!
Oh, boy.
Did you see that?
I can't really tell, but it seems like he's very good.
Cheers, again.
And some unemployed gaffers are asking if we'll have an opening soon.
Tony Pulis. Alan Curbishley. Harry Redknapp called three times.
Hi. I've been up all night doing deep dives on all the players.
Did you know that Richard was raised on a goat farm?
And that Isaac's mother has two left hands?
And I called a couple of contacts about some sponsorship opportunities.
Even got myself a little work planner.
You couldn't get one without the word "unicorn" written on it?
Fuck off. It's adorable.
Sorry, I couldn't help but think how you'd react if I told you to F off.
That'll be all, Higgins.
Of course.
I'm really glad to see that you're laughing.
I just came by to see if you're okay, really.
Why wouldn't I be?
Oh, Christ. Have you not seen the news yet?
I really wanted to be the one to comfort you, not to break it to you.
So, you remember that stunning girl, Bex?
The one that Rupert left with the night of the gala?
Do you really want me to pretend that she wasn't mad fit?
I'd appreciate it.
Okay, well. That hideous cow, whose name's Bex, which is actually short for...
Rebecca.
Yep, which is also your name, as you know.
So the press is calling her-- "New Rebecca." Shit.
Nope.
The press is calling her "Rebecca," and you're...
"Old Rebecca." What?
Old Rebecca.
Old Rebecca?
Don't worry about it. You've got this.
And if you ever have a moment, or if you don't got this, then you just call me, right?
Wow! That was on purpose, yes?
Yeah. Look, mate.
You're good, yeah, but up here, there's a difference between good and great.
1-1. Your turn, <i>amigo</i>.
Fuck's sake.
Right, watch this then. Left post.
Wow. That was good.
I know.
Yeah!
I got lucky.
Again tomorrow, Jamie Tartt?
We'll see.
Football is life!
Dani Rojas, Rojas! Dani Rojas!
Oh, boy. I tell you, man.
I feel like we fell out of a lucky tree, hit every branch on the way down, ended up in a pool full of cash and Sour Patch Kids.
I mean, Jamie is an ace, right?
You know, whose attitude turned him into a seven of clubs.
So then we bring in another fella to help turn him back into an ace and then that fella ends up being an ace himself.
And so now we got two aces.
Aces. Aces. Oh, heck. I did it again. I'm stuck.
Aces.
That's the word, yeah?
Aces.
Aces.
Ace.
Aces? Oh, now I'm in there.
See? Okay, good.
Aces? Aces.
I hope it's not contagious.
Aces.
Aces. Aces.
Aces? Aces.
Aces.
Aces.
Isis.
No, that sounds like "ISIS." I did say "ISIS." I didn't mean to.
Okay, what if we cloned the lead guitarist from Kiss?
You'd have two-- Frehleys.
It's lovely weather we've been having, don't you think?
I love this time of year.
All the smells of fresh leaves.
What's happening?
I was just pretending that the two of us were on a walk.
I'm trying to read.
I've been doing a lot of reading myself, actually, recently.
I read this mad story about a kid who grew up in a shit part of South London.
And who got sent off to play as a child in Sunderland, of all places.
And who later was forced to rap his own verse in a charity single which was called "Winner, Winner, Football Dinner." That was for world hunger.
And I believe it was the cure.
How do you know all this anyway? What are you doing now? Stalking me?
No. I'm reading all the players' bios.
Rebecca's got me in to help with the team's PR.
Well, you leave me out of it. I'm not one of your show ponies.
You wear a number, trot around while people clap, so I wouldn't be too high and mighty about it.
Later, Roy.
Dani Rojas! Dani, Dani!
Okay.
Okay, okay, I don't understand. What the heck happened, all right?
Did you trip over something?
That's the thing, Coach.
I did not trip over something. Something tripped me.
Something not there.
Yeah. Okay, Doc. Let's go get him looked at.
Okay. You're okay.
God, this is all my fault.
I saw Dani go into the treatment room before training, and I didn't say anything.
That was a mistake.
How could you not say anything?
Well, I hope you've all said your goodbyes, 'cause we're never gonna see him again.
Hey, that's enough!
One more person says something that me and Beard don't understand, I'm gonna have one of my son's classic temper tantrums.
It's basically just him calling me a bunch of silly names, you know, like, I don't know, "dummy head" or "poo-poo face" or "poo-poo dummy" or-- I don't know. What am I missing?
"Pee-pee fingers." "Pee-pee fingers." Come on, now. Spill.
The treatment room is cursed.
What?
It's true.
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this?
Well, I think it has a lot to do with grown men being embarrassed to admit that they believe in all this hoodoo, voodoo, juju business.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Okay, good.
Then me and you, we're gonna go look in that room.
No.
Why not?
Because... No.
Heck! Oh, man.
I mean, Dani was out there, what, an hour ago?
Running circles on that pitch like a joyous raven-haired golden retriever.
Coach, is it true in America you guys have so many beautiful dogs in pounds that some get put down for no reason?
That is true, Sam.
But it's also something a lot of female singer-songwriters are trying to change.
Look, we're not gonna put Dani Rojas down. I'll tell you that right now.
Gentlemen, I need you to gather up the rest of the fellas.
'Cause we got ourselves a curse to reverse.
What the fuck's wrong with you two?
The whole Richmond team's here.
Holy shit.
Hey, Coach. Jamie?
Okay. That's okay.
Hey, guys.
Hey, fellas. Fellas, listen up.
Thank you, guys, for coming out.
Look, I don't know a lot about this stuff, you know.
I don't know about curses.
But I do know this, they don't last forever.
Okay, look at the Boston Red Sox curse. That's over.
Chicago Cubs, over.
Heck, even Mr. Martin Scorsese finally won his Oscar.
But I think we can all agree that <i>The Departed</i> is not necessarily his best work.
No.
Yeah.
That belongs to <i>The Color of Money</i>.
No, it's <i>Goodfellas</i>.
Agree to disagree.
Nah, nah. It's <i>Age of Innocence</i>, bruv.
<i>Cape Fear.</i> <i>Silence</i>!
Oi, once the word gets out you lot are in here, this place will turn into a fucking zoo.
And the answer's <i>Mean Streets</i>.
Yeah. That's a good one.
Yeah.
You're all here because of this poster behind me.
Mr. Higgins.
"Are you a fast, fit, fan of football?" That's solid alliteration right there.
Hundreds of those posters were put up around Richmond on the 18th of November, 1914.
It was an invitation for young men to try out to be a professional footballer.
It said to come to our stadium that day.
And it was a lie.
In 1914, the war was raging. There was no tryout.
Just recruiters, waiting to encourage those boys to fight the fight.
They enlisted 400 lads that day.
Very few of them came home.
And after they enlisted...
do you know where they went for their physical?
Oh, Christ, it's our treatment room, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
Hey, no, no, no. Hey, no, fellas. No, it was not, okay?
It was. I'm sorry, I'm lying to ya. I don't even know why I'm lying.
I'm sorry. I just wanted y'all to take a breath for a second.
Wait, wait, wait. What you're telling me is that we've got 400 ghosts?
That's too many ghosts.
We cannot fight them all.
We're not going to have to fight them, Richard.
Wait, so, Coach, how do we fix this?
We can't change the past.
No, Sam. No, we cannot.
But we can choose to honor it.
Now, those young men, they made the ultimate sacrifice.
So I think it's only fair that we sacrifice something of our own.
I'm gonna ask each and every one of you to go home tonight, find something, an item.
Something personal. Something that you truly value.
And I want you to bring it tonight to the clubhouse, at midnight.
No. That is bullshit.
We're all going to fucking do it!
All right.
That's your captain talking right there.
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!
Told you.
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!
Hi, Jamie. What do you need?
Babe, I said it was important. We can't go inside your house?
No way! We can't.
Sex was, like, the only thing that you and I was good at.
I've had three glasses of wine. It's Pavlovian.
Pavlovian? What is that? Is that the wine?
Babe, can we not at least just get inside my car? It's cold.
No. You don't remember how many times we shagged in this thing?
So the car's also Pavlovian?
Think I'm getting it now.
So, what's up, Jamie?
Fucking Ted Lasso.
He's really gotten up your bum, hasn't he?
Babe, he's not even a real coach.
Do you know what we're supposed to do tonight?
Apparently, some bullshit sacrifice, show-and-tell bullshit.
Okay. You gonna go?
No, 'course I'm not.
Is everyone else doing it?
Yeah, but I'm Jamie Tartt.
I'm not like everyone else.
Do you think that I could've got from a council estate in North Manchester to the Premier League, if I did what everyone else did?
No. I don't.
You're a battler, Jamie.
It's really hot.
But maybe someday you should stop battling the people that just wanna help you.
I feel like you want me to come in.
It's Pavlovian.
Have a good night, Jamie Tartt.
Come in.
Excuse me, Ms. Welton. Hi, I'm Sam. Sam Obisanya. I play for the team.
Yes, Sam. I know who you are.
Is there something I can help you with?
This is really awkward, but are you free tonight?
Sam, I am very flattered, but-- No, no, no. It's not for romance.
It's just to get rid of this curse. I can understand why you misinterpreted.
I mean, you're so lovely you must get romantic invitations all the time.
That's nice.
Gosh, I'm dealing with my own sort of curse. Anyway, thank you.
I'm from Nigeria, and so I feel like whenever the subject of curses comes up, people are like, "I bet the African guy is really into this." You're obviously not?
No, no, no. I really am.
But that's mainly from loving Harry Potter.
Do you know J. K. Rowling has more money than the Queen?
I did.
I like the idea of someone becoming rich, because of what they gave to the world.
Not just because of who their family is.
Well, Ms. Welton, I really hope you can participate in this ceremony that we're having later tonight.
I don't think so.
I apologize, but I can't take no for an answer.
Coach thinks it will only work if the whole team is there, and Ms. Welton, it's your team.
So you have to be there. Please.
At least think about it.
For you, Sam, I will.
Thank you.
See you tonight.
See ya.
Gentlemen, I am, by nature, a believer.
Ghosts, spirit guides, aliens.
Still, I can't actually tell you what lives beyond our physical world and what doesn't.
What I can tell you, is that with the exception of the wit and wisdom of <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, not much lasts forever.
Hey, boss. Glad you could join us.
Hello. Yeah.
Roy, why don't you get things started for us?
I was nine when I got scouted by Sunderland, and I'd never left London before.
My granddad drove me all the way there, and it was freezing, and I was terrified.
I was fucking nine. Say something.
When I got there, he gave me this old blanket.
He said it was to keep me warm and to remind me of home.
And that was the last time I saw him.
'Cause he'd passed away by the time I got back for Christmas, so...
That is why blankie means so much to me.
Did you just say "blankie"?
No, I said "blanket." Conversation over. Sam, go.
This is a picture of the 1994 Nigerian World Cup team.
I pledged I wouldn't take this down until I made the team myself...
and I still intend to do that.
This sand is from a beach in St. Barts.
This is the first beach where I ever...
It's the first beach where I ever slept with a supermodel.
Smile because it happened.
Thanks.
Sam and Richard coming at ya from both ends of the spectrum there.
Appreciate that.
A girl once said I look like Clive Owen in these sunglasses.
I don't think I can do it.
Come on, Nate. Throw 'em in.
You got it, Nate. Give it a toss.
Nice.
Good boy, Nate.
Thank you. Thank you.
Is that today's paper?
There's something in there about me, as usual, and I'm trying not to care.
Fuck the haters.
Word.
This is my cat's collar. She was a faithful companion for 20 years.
Gonna miss you, Cindy Clawford.
It's the only pen I can write my name with.
The keys to my Lamborghini.
How you getting home?
All right. Everybody go?
Yeah.
No. I wanna go.
These aren't my first boots or anything. My mum gave 'em me.
She was the one who got me into football in the first place.
Her and me dad split up when I was just a sexy little baby.
She's the reason I work so hard. Just wanted to make her proud.
She doesn't even care if I'm any good.
Just wants me to be happy. Be a good lad.
Once I got good though, me old man started showing up, didn't he?
You know, bragging to all his mates every time I scored a goal.
Calling me "soft" if I didn't... dominate, you know.
And I hated that.
I actually fucking hated that.
So, I made a vow to be so tough that he could never call me "soft" again.
I wonder if sometimes...
I forget about making her proud.
I don't think that she would be lately.
Well, gentlemen...
What do you say we burn this crap?
Maybe we should do this part outside.
Yeah.
That's a good call.
Yeah. That's smart. Okay.
Hey, would you guys mind grabbing this for me?
Excuse me, Ted. The eagle has landed.
Hey, fellas.
I think the only way to know if the curse has been lifted or not, we need to ask the spirits for a sign.
Spirits...
speak to us.
Dani Rojas! Rojas! Dani Rojas.
I brought a bottle of mezcal to throw into the curse fire.
Hey, hey, hey. Rojas, look.
Whatever ghosts it were that made you trip over, they're gone now, I promise, yeah.
Crack that bastard open.
Yeah, boy!
Yeah.
Jamie's not wrong. Ghosts prefer empty bottles that we've all drunk.
Fact.
Let us celebrate, <i>amigos</i>.
That is a team united.
You're very lucky that everything's fine with Dani's injury.
I just never had you pegged as a gambler, Ted.
I'm not. We knew Dani's okay hours ago.
In fact, it was my man Higgins' idea not to share that info with the boys until after the ceremony.
You don't say.
Yeah.
Putting the team first, eh, Higgins?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
Hey, Coach, you joining the party or what?
What do you say, boss? A lot warmer over there by the fire.
I'll respectfully pass.
Higgins, coming with me?
Off you go.
All right now, what's this going on?
What's going on here? What's going on?
Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die. We're Richmond till we die.
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die. We're Richmond till we die.
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die. We're Richmond till we die.
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die. We're Richmond till we die.
We know we are, we're sure we are. We're Richmond till we die.
Morning. How y'all doin'?
Hey. That's cool.
Oh, boy. Here we go.
I got it.
Interception. Easy, gentlemen, easy.
Good morning, honey bunch.
You hear that buzz out there? I love it.
How you doing?
You got rid of Jamie?
Man City recalled him.
I told you, Ted. They were concerned he wasn't playing.
I finally got through to him!
I mean, you saw it.
With him and Dani, we had two aces, Rebecca.
I thought that was what you wanted.
Yeah, well, you thought wrong!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for my tone there, okay. That was rude.
Look, I'm trying to be cool about this, but I am just seeing red everywhere.
Well, perhaps you should leave before you say something you'll regret.
No, actually, you know what? Here you go.
Your biscuits.
I hope they're not as good as they usually are.
But dang it, they're the best batch yet. I finally cracked the recipe!
Coach?
Football is life.
 @@@@@@
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, Trevor, no. The bag has to go all the way in, okay?
Use all the space. Out the way. Thank you.
What's gone on back here? Right.
These need to be moved around, 'cause this is gonna jiggle about, otherwise.
Now, can we move-- Hello?
There's someone in here. Oh, my God.
Hey, almost forgot. You know how we're playing Everton tomorrow?
<i>Yeah.</i> Well, that's not a town.
It's actually a team in Liverpool!
<i>Like the Beatles!</i> <i>If you see John, Paul, George or Ringo, will you take a picture, please?</i> Hey, you got it, big guy.
Okay, hey, I better get a roll on here, all right?
<i>Okay. And Mom wants to talk to you. Hold on.</i> I love you, buddy.
<i>Love you too.</i> Still haven't told him John and George are dead?
They're what?
It was Keith Richards.
<i>Hey, Ted.</i> Hey. How you doing?
<i>Good.</i> How's work going? Everything all right?
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry. I know this isn't easy, but the paperwork the lawyer sent?</i> I know. Oh, hey.
Got it right here.
I'll, uh, look it all over, sign it, send it right back. I promise.
<i>Okay, thanks. Hey, good luck tomorrow. We'll be watching.</i> All right now.
Whoo-hoo!
Girls' trip!
Mm. Liverpool, here we come.
I just want to say up front that I'm really flattered you asked me to come this weekend.
Oh. Come on now.
But, hey, we're both single. I think you are super hot.
If I'm gonna dip my toe back into the lady pool, I can't think of a finer body of water to do it with than you.
No. Keeley, I think you're confused.
I was, at first. Then I was like, "Come on, Keeley.
Blow off some steam and have some wicked sex with your new friend." I'm fucking with you.
Oh, my God.
I thought you were being serious. I mean, can you imagine?
Oh, I have.
<i>Do-da do-da do do do do doo</i> Looks like we have a new passenger on today's flight.
Actually, Keeley will be taking your seat on the jet, Higgins.
Oh.
Sorry.
I'm gonna go spend a penny before we take off.
See you downstairs, Rebecca.
Oh, that's okay. I always enjoy the antics on the team bus.
No. I need you to stay here this weekend.
Doing work that doesn't matter.
All right, gentlemen. Who's ready to go show Everton what we got?
Whoo!
Thank you, Dani.
Jeez, Louise. Why's everybody so down in the dumps?
What happened? Did Beyoncé dump Jay-Z or something?
No, nothing like that.
Thank goodness. Just saying it out loud made me immediately sad.
Let me see what's going on here.
Hey, guys. Seriously, come on. Talk to me. What's up?
Well, we're fine.
Mm.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Okay.
We're in a shit fucking mood because we never fucking win at Everton and it sucks fucking shit!
Ah, come on, fellas.
How long has it been since y'all won up at Everton?
Sixty years ago.
Jesus Christ.
Wow. That is a heck of a long time. Okay.
So we got that going on.
And obviously we're bummed out that O'Brien tore his butt.
It's my upper hamstring, Coach.
You tore your butt, son. There's nothing to be ashamed of, okay? It happens.
People tear their butts all the time in athletics. You're not alone, man.
Hey, Coach, you've torn your butt a few times, right?
Three times.
Three times.
Butt's an amazing muscle. God as my witness, your butt will heal.
The silver lining here, with O'Brien's tore butt, is that my man from Montreal is gonna be filling in at goalie.
Give it up for Zorro.
Oh. It's pronounced, um, "Zoreaux." I'm sorry. Zorro.
"Zoreaux." You-- I don't know what I'm doing wrong here.
Point is, gentlemen, unless one of y'all got a crystal ball, we don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
That's why we play the game.
So let me hear it! Richmond on three! One, two, three!
Richmond!
Right, come on. Let's go.
Hey, Coach.
Howdy, fellas. How can I help you?
Um, so, uh, since Jamie Tartt has gone back to Man City, uh, you've lost one, you've drawn one, you've not scored any goals.
Yeah.
So I'm wondering, how worried are you about the threat of relegation?
Lloyd, right now I'm mostly concerned with the definition of relegation.
What you got for me, Marcus?
Just wanted to know how you're feeling about the departure of Jamie Tartt.
Yeah. Um...
Well, if I'm being honest, it, uh, breaks my heart a little.
I think one of the neatest things about being a coach is the connection you get to make with your players.
That's a loss that hits me a lot harder and is gonna stay with me a lot longer than anything that happens while playing a game on a patch of grass.
All right. See you fellas in Liverpool, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh. Hey! Last one there is a Scotch egg! Whoo!
What?
Hey, there he is.
Good to see you, buddy.
All right, let's go.
Here we go. It's the presidential suite. Hope it's to your satisfaction.
Would you like me to show you the various room amenities?
No, thank you.
My lady and I wanna have a quick shag and a shower before we hit the town tonight.
Welcome to Liverpool.
What? He would've spent a cash tip in, like, a minute.
Come on. The image I just gave him is gonna last for a lifetime.
No, it's-- it's not you. It's-- Oh, fuck.
This is Rupert's and my anniversary weekend. And-- It's the first one I've spent by myself-- Hey, it's okay.
Thank you.
Mm.
Ooh. That's a long hug.
So, just to remind you, the hotel furniture stays in the rooms, not the hallway or the pool.
Nor are you allowed to ship it to your homes or other hotels, okay?
All right, fellas, we got team meal in an hour.
After that, it's either gonna be movie night or a pillow fight.
What's it gonna be this time around?
Movie night.
All right. But I tell you what, y'all say "pillow fight" one time, and we'll never watch another movie together again.
That's for you, Coach.
Thank you, sir.
And that's for you.
Thank you.
Whoo! Room 5150. Finally.
Sammy Hagar, greatest lead singer in Van Halen history.
In the post-David Lee Roth era.
Thank you.
Coach, what room you got?
5148.
Hey.
Howdy, neighbor.
Yes, hello. We still haven't received the champagne I ordered. Thank you.
Ah. Good question. One second.
Should I get the concierge to make us a reservation somewhere tonight?
Shipley's steak house is unmatched in its cuisine and ambience.
Mm. Is it now? Cool, I can do steak.
Uh, yes. The steak house for two, please.
Does 8:00 p. m. work for you?
The business center is open 24 hours a day.
Okay.
What was that about the business center?
<i>Guests also have access to our state-of-the-art gym,</i> <i>filled with the latest in workout technology.</i> <i>Like kettlebells!</i> Oh, my God.
<i>Liverpool has much to offer when it comes to nightlife.</i> <i>From pubs and clubs, to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!</i> I don't even remember doing this.
<i>And if you're the artsy type--</i> Right, enough.
This weekend is moving forward.
When that champagne arrives, we are going to get drunk, have a nice meal, and leave the past in the past.
Sound good?
Sounds fucking great.
Oh. Speak of the devil.
Hello, Stinky.
Still giving you the big room even without old gray walnuts footing the bill.
Good. Fuck Rupert!
Oh. Who's this then? Is this your concubine? Is she Russian?
Are you Russian?
A, I love you. B, who are you?
Let me introduce Flo Collins, my best mate since we were little.
Brilliant child psychologist and proud, newly single...
Mm-hmm.
... mother to the most amazing 12-year-old little girl called Nora, my goddaughter.
Wow.
Both of whom I've completely neglected to speak to in the last six years.
Oh, Jesus, Stinky.
Remind me to bury you in the set list for speeches at my funeral.
Hi, I'm Flo. Or you can call me "Sassy." I don't care which.
So, you heard about the divorce?
Yeah. I bumped into Derren at a party. He told me right after he hit on me.
Hey, what's new? Still, weird order for him to roll out that information.
Right, what's in the plan for tonight, then?
Shall I call down? Get myself a robe?
Oh!
Look what I've got.
Ta-da!
Stole it off a room service trolley outside.
You're amazing!
I'm Keeley, by the way. Hi!
Oh!
Yeah, I know who you are, honey.
My ex used to masturbate to you like a maniac, so...
Am I cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs thinking we can beat these guys tomorrow?
No, we match up perfectly.
Exactly.
What about you, Nate? You believe these guys can win?
I believe this team can do anything.
See? There you go. That's what I'm talking about.
Okay, Nate. So if you were me, what would you tell these guys?
Oh, no. I wouldn't-- No, I don't-- Hey. I'm just asking for your opinion. You understand that, yeah?
Yeah.
And you got one, yes?
Yeah.
Locked, loaded, ready to rip?
Mm-hmm.
Let me hear it.
No.
Why not? What are you afraid's gonna happen if you tell me?
That you won't like my idea and it makes you hate me.
Then you fire me.
Then I have to move back in with my parents and they'll be ashamed of me.
Then everyone finds out back home and laughs at me until my face melts off.
Excuse me.
Well, at least he didn't stammer.
Mm.
I gotta go take care of a couple things. I'll see you in the morning, all right?
Hey, do me a favor. Keep an eye on these guys, 'cause around the 74 minute mark, there's gonna be a room full of grown men crying.
I'll be one of 'em.
Right, so I hadn't prepared anything.
Not the brightest idea for a maid of honor, especially with an open bar.
Yeah, she was the star of the weekend.
Yeah, I gave Elton John a boner.
You did what?
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
He has repeatedly denied that.
Ah. Classic "she said, she said," innit?
Would you ladies like another bottle? A little dessert perhaps?
My sexy and extremely single friend here actually prefers her desserts on the larger side.
If that's something you could possibly accommodate.
I'll give you a few minutes.
Thank you. Sorry.
I can't believe you just did that.
Oh, shut up. You love it.
Right. I'm going for a smoke. Stinky?
No. Don't smoke anymore.
And yet, you're still on fire.
Hmm.
Yeah, I don't know. Just-- May I suggest flushing it again but harder? Okay, bye.
Hi, how can I help you?
Hey, how you doing? I was wondering if y'all had a fax machine.
Fax machine?
Oh, okay. Um, that's a good question. If you bear with me a second, I'll just check with a colleague and see what I can find out.
A fax machine, hey? Are you sending something to the year 1997?
Yeah, just a little note to myself telling me to buy Apple stock.
Oh. Good idea.
Can you tell me to murder J. K. Rowling and write the first Harry Potter book as well?
Can do. Yeah. I'll probably write "handle" instead of "murder," so there's no paper trail.
Yeah, I'm Ted, by the way.
Oh. Sassy.
Sassy, huh? Like the Smurf, right?
Don't think there was a Sassy Smurf, was there?
That's too bad.
Seems like a Smurf with an attitude would've been a lot of fun to watch.
All right, yeah, I'll tell him. Let me know how the trial goes. Okay, bye.
Right, we no longer have a fax machine on the premises.
But the concierge was able to locate one at a tanning salon eight miles away in Croxteth.
You know what, that's okay.
I'm just gonna hit this manicurist nearby that has carrier pigeons.
Thank you though. All right.
Okay.
Nice meeting you.
Right, how can I help you?
Well, I was gonna go out for a smoke and hope my friend picks up the check while I was gone.
Then I saw Magnum, P. I. in line, figured I'd flirt with him as well.
See what happens, you know?
Oh, well, good luck.
Yeah, I think I fucked it.
I-- I actually get off in about 30 minutes if you'd like to, uh-- Of course not, why would you?
<i>You are who you choose to be.</i> <i>Superman.</i> Okay, so I just met the fucking Marlboro Man in the-- Where's Stinky gone? She abandoned you?
No, she just went to pee.
Oh.
Where does "Stinky" come from?
I remember the day she moved into our town.
She was already taller than me, had bigger boobs.
Family was rich. So, first day of year seven, I told everyone her nickname was "Stinky." That's genius.
To the ties that bind us.
To Rebecca.
Yeah, that's not Rebecca.
How do you mean?
No, the real Rebecca is silly.
Strong, yeah, but not cold.
Have you ever heard her sing?
No.
Ah. Beautiful voice.
Her and Nora would sing through the door for hours.
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i> Who's Nora?
My daughter.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, if you like that woman, you are gonna love Rebecca.
Ready?
What about the bill?
Thank you, Miss Welton.
Okay.
Do you wanna do that thing where you pretend you wanted to pay?
Oh, yeah, yeah. This is really good fun. Join in.
Oh, you absolute piece of shit! I was about to do that!
I was just about to get my card out.
I can't believe that you've done this.
We were gonna split. That was so nice.
Six years I've waited for this...
What the hell are you doing?
I'm-- I'm so sorry. I just-- You're what?
What is this?
It's just my thoughts on the team.
Go, Nathan. Come on, it's past curfew.
Go! Get outta here!
Sorry.
<i>Liverpool has much to offer when it comes to nightlife.</i> <i>From pubs and clubs, to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!</i> <i>And if you're the artsy type, or you're just trying to impress a date,</i> <i>Liverpool has more museums and galleries...</i> <i>Welcome to Goodison Park. I'm Arlo White here with Chris Powell.</i> Okay, guys! Got some snacks here!
Whoo-hoo!
Let's try not to eat them all in the first half. Come on, Richmond!
<i>It's eighth-place Everton hosting AFC Richmond,</i> <i>in 18th and staring relegation in the face.</i> <i>The last time Richmond left here with a win,</i> <i>the number one song in the UK was by Elvis Presley, "It's Now or Never."</i> <i>And that's certainly the case for Ted Lasso's men tonight.</i> Nate, can I speak with you, please?
Yeah.
You all right?
I wanted to apologize for last night. I bit your head off for no good reason, and I'm really sorry about that and I hope you can forgive me.
Yeah, of cour-- Yes, of course.
Thank you. Also, I read through your thoughts.
Yeah.
They're great.
And I agree with every last one of 'em.
But I can't say this to them.
But they need to hear it.
I agree.
That's why you're gonna do it.
Are you drunk?
You're giving the pregame talk, and you're gonna read them this.
I ju-- I don't know.
It'll be fun.
No. No, no, no.
Oh, my God.
All right, listen up, fellas.
As of late, I feel like y'all have heard enough of my jibber-jabber.
So I asked Nate the Great here to jot down a few of his thoughts and ideas about you guys and today's game.
So let's focus up.
All yours, Nate.
Okay.
Let's go, Nate.
Come on, boy. You got this.
You got this, Nate. It's okay.
Okay. Thank you. Let's do it.
Isaac.
Hmm?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you got this, bruv, all right?
Yeah.
I've noticed of late...
that you've been playing like a big, dumb pussy.
Wow.
What the fuck did you say to me, bruv?
You're more concerned about looking tough than actually being tough.
There's a way to be intimidating without being physical.
I hope you don't mind me saying.
Um...
Sam.
Oh, no.
You're constantly getting beat on the wings.
It's 'cause you're indecisive.
You second-guess more than a shitty psychic.
The only African I know more imprisoned by their own thoughts is goddamn Nelson Mandela.
Did you hear that?
You think that's funny, do you, Colin? You and all your fancy step over bullshit.
Let me ask you this. Do you wax your pubes?
What?
Did I stutter, dickhead? Do you wax your pubes? Yes or no.
No.
Then why are you always trying to play like a Brazilian?
Yeah.
What just happened?
Uh, Rojas.
Whoo! Roast me, <i>amigo.</i> All right. You say that football is life, right?
Football is life.
Yeah, well, then your defense is death.
Oh!
The only person I've seen lose their man more often is Carrie fucking Bradshaw.
Oh!
<i>Sex and the City</i>.
Shh.
Yeah.
Tough but fair.
Right. Roy.
Go on. Say what you're gonna say.
Okay.
Don't read it.
Say it to my face.
The great Roy Kent.
You're old now.
And slow. And your focus drifts.
But your speed and your smarts were never what made you who you are.
It's your anger. That's your superpower.
That's what made you one of the best midfielders in the history of this league.
But I haven't seen it on the pitch at all this season, Roy.
I mean, you used to run like you were angry at the grass.
You'd kick the ball like you'd caught it fucking your wife, for Christ's sake.
But that anger doesn't come out anymore when you play.
But it's still in there.
And I'm afraid of what it's gonna do to you if you just keep it all for yourself.
Ooh!
Let's go get these fuckers.
See? Told you it'd be fun.
<i>And the impossible has happened. Richmond have won at Everton 1-0.</i> Yes, Ted! Yeah!
<i>Thanks to a rare goal from Roy Kent.</i> <i>Kent was absolutely brilliant today.</i> <i>He was like a man possessed.</i> Yeah!
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die. We're Richmond...
Oh, my God!
Come on, give us a hug, Nate. Yeah.
Ted!
Hey!
Congratulations.
Thanks, boss.
Could I, uh, just introduce you to-- Sassy Smurf!
Marlboro Man! Oh, my God.
We know we are, we're sure we are...
I didn't know you were here.
Surprise!
I've been thinking about you a lot this weekend.
Oh, yeah? How come?
'Cause you and your crazy hair keep popping up every time I turn on my TV.
Oi! Listen up!
None of you are going back to the hotel tonight.
'Cause we did something today that no one thought we could do, including us!
So, we're going out, we're celebrating, and we're gonna rub it in this city's fucking face!
Roy! Roy! Where are we going?
Keeley?
Well, Liverpool has much to offer.
From pubs to clubs to the great Asian pastime of...
<i>I said maybe</i> <i>Said maybe</i> <i>You're gonna be the one that saves me</i> <i>Saves me</i> <i>And after all</i> <i>You're my wonderwall</i> I'm going for a smoke.
Can I join you?
Come on.
Thank you, Richmond FC!
So, what's Marlboro Man's story, then?
'Cause I kinda wanna grab him by the ears and ride that little mustache like a Jet Ski.
It's so good to see you, Sass.
You too, Stinky.
God. You know, today would've been my-- Of course I know. Why do you think I'm here?
Mate, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for disappearing from you, from Nora.
I really am.
Thank you for saying that.
Mm.
God, that man took so much from me.
No.
Rupert is a horrible man who built an ivory tower he kept you captive in.
But you climbed every single step of that tower on your own.
You're the one who stopped coming home, stopped calling.
Who made a six-year-old girl wonder what she'd done wrong.
I'll always be your biggest defender, but you have to own up to the part that you played.
You're right.
Course I'm right. I'm always right.
You're not always right. Most of the time you're an arse.
There you are. Fucking hell. I thought you guys ditched me.
No!
As if!
Jesus, I didn't know that I had abandonment issues till right now.
Come on, Rebecca. Your song's up next.
What?
Yeah.
No, I didn't put a song in.
Well, then someone else must've done it for you.
Who could've done that?
See? You are an arse.
<i>Caught in a bad romance</i> <i>Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah Roma-roma-ma</i> <i>Gaga, ooh-la-la</i> <i>Want your bad romance</i> All right, who's next?
Me, me, me.
Your turn, Rebecca. Get on up here.
Thank you. Oh, God.
Okay. Uh, I don't even know what song I'm singing.
But I would like to dedicate it to the best friend a girl could ever have.
That is me! She's talking about me!
This is also dedicated to my goddaughter, Nora.
I love you.
<i>The snow glows white On the mountain tonight</i> <i>Not a footprint to be seen</i> <i>A kingdom of isolation And it looks like I'm the queen</i> <i>The wind is howling Like this swirling storm inside</i> <i>Couldn't keep it in Heaven knows I've tried</i> <i>Don't let them in, don't let them see Be the good girl you always have to be</i> <i>Conceal, don't feel Don't let them know</i> <i>Well, now they know</i> <i>Let it go, let it go</i> <i>Can't hold it back anymore</i> <i>Let it go, let it go</i> <i>Turn away and slam the door</i> <i>I don't care what they're going to say</i> <i>Let the storm rage on</i> <i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i> <i>Ted.</i> <i>Dad?</i> Ted?
Ted.
It's okay.
Try to breathe.
I can't. I don't know what's going on. I'm-- I'm sorry.
It's okay. You're having a panic attack. Just breathe.
Am I going crazy?
No more than anyone else.
All right. You're all right.
There we go. There we go. There we go. Come on.
Come on.
There we go.
I think I need to call it a night.
Gonna go back to the hotel and just get a good night's rest, you know?
Would you like me to walk back with you?
Do you want to take my car?
No, no, no. I'm okay. Thank you though. I appreciate it.
All right.
Okay.
Hey, do me a favor. Just, uh, let Beard know I went back to the hotel.
Of course. You just get home safely.
Okay, thank you.
All right.
Okay.
Excuse me. Very drunk man coming through.
Yeah.
Guys. Guys, guys, guys. I think we should take the boys to the pub.
Oh, I am so done, Sass. Sorry.
Think I'm tapping out for the evening too, actually.
So I have to take 18 young, handsome men all by myself?
Oh, trauma.
All right then. See you later.
Bye. I love you.
<i>Amigos,</i> I can't find my tropical shirt.
He's so drunk.
You won't need it, you won't need it.
Right, want a lift back to the hotel?
Oh, no. Um, I think I'm gonna walk, actually.
Unless you want me to come with you, 'cause that I can do.
I'm fine. Really.
Yeah?
Besides, that was yesterday.
You're wasting valuable time.
Yeah, yeah. I'm going, I'm going.
Oh, this is me.
I'm sharing a suite with Rebecca. We've got separate bedrooms though.
Good night.
 @@@@@@
Hello, <i>mon cher.</i> Coach! Over here.
Thank God.
Z-man, Dani.
He looks like a beautiful angel-man.
Good morning, sunshine.
You okay?
I didn't want to miss the bus, so I just slept in here.
Sorry, I'm gonna vomit. Sorry.
Oh, my God.
Wait. What am I doing? This is my fucking room.
Oi! Out.
Hey, you.
Hey. Good morning.
I got you a coffee.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You been up long?
Hour or two.
You know? I guess three hours total.
Last night was fun.
Oh, yeah. Five stars. Certified fresh.
Have you got to go?
Yeah.
But, you know, you don't need to rush out or anything.
I got you a late checkout.
That's very thoughtful of you.
Go on then. You go.
I'm gonna go back to sleep, and then I'm gonna order a huge breakfast on your tab.
That's a pro move right there. Yeah.
Hey, I'll be your Underhills anytime.
Okay. Well... I'll see you around, I guess.
Coach.
Hey, Coach.
Coach.
Yeah?
Something on your mind, Coach?
No, why?
We just had a five-hour bus ride where you didn't talk a lick, and that's a record by about five hours.
Okay, look. I'm gonna tell you something but then I don't wanna talk about it ever again, okay?
Okay.
I'm serious.
I don't want to make jokes about it.
I don't want you giving me any knowing glances.
You know what I mean? Okay.
Okay.
Last night, I...
I slept with Rebecca's friend Sassy.
Want to talk about it?
I'd love to. Yeah. Immediately.
There you are.
I thought this room was haunted.
No. We sorted that.
Is now a good time?
Yeah. You can come in. She can't hear anything with those in.
You sure?
Gail, you think the royal family are lizards, right?
Twenty-three. So young.
What's she listening to?
Always murder podcasts.
Last night was crazy.
Right, yeah. It was pretty sloppy.
I could really use a bucket of coffee to nurse this hangover.
Do you wanna go get one with me when you're done?
Not today. I can't. I'm busy.
He's lying.
Right. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, 'cause she's about to go to town on my hamstrings and I make a lot of noises, and I don't like people hearing my noises.
Cool. All right. I'll see you around, yeah?
Okay.
'Cause, look, it's just not something I've ever done before, okay?
And look, I got no judgment on people that have one-night stands, okay?
I mean, if you are, you know, nuts for butts, have at it. That's what I say.
Coach, did you have fun?
Come on, Coach. I don't like all that kiss-and-tell stuff.
Coach, did you have fun?
And did she have fun?
Yeah, that movement's making me feel queasy.
Okay. So, then what's the problem?
I mean, maybe I just haven't really come to peace with the fact that I went from having a mental breakdown at a karaoke joint in Liverpool to, you know, sleeping with a woman I just met.
And then somewhere in between there, getting a divorce.
Well, it makes sense to me.
I must say that this is lovely.
Ever since I was little, I always used to dream about sitting down with a bunch of mates talking about the complex dynamics between men and women.
Okay, here's another question for y'all. Should I tell Rebecca?
No.
Come on now. Why not?
I mean, it'd break my heart if I found out she was hiding something from me.
What's happening? You having a meeting?
Yep. I'm having lady problems.
I'd love to get your perspective on it.
No.
Ted, can I be honest with you?
Come on, let it rip.
You seem intent on going 12 rounds with yourself. Why?
What did you do wrong?
He's right.
Time to get you some of these.
What, scissors?
Yeah. To cut yourself some slack.
Wow.
Y'all stuck the landing on that. That was nice.
Tell you what, I gotta get you all some satin jackets made, with "Ted Lasso's Personal Dilemma Squad" embroidered on the back there.
That's a clunky name. There's gotta be something better here.
Let me think. I know. How about the "EQ Warriors"?
The "Knights of Support"?
Nah. Sounds like a brand of jockstrap.
The "Proud Boys"?
What about the "Diamond Dogs"?
Attaboy, Nate. Diamond Dogs it is.
Come on, Roy.
I thought you were supposed to be in Manchester.
We played West Ham, so I'm in town.
Yeah. Come in. How you doing?
Yeah, I'm good.
I had ten touches, I had two completed dribbles, and in the 89th minute they let me take a free kick.
I scored. Got half a chub.
So you thought you'd bring your half-chub over here then, right?
No. No, I just... wanted to talk.
You know, everything happened so fast when Lasso dumped me.
Oi. Come on. Lasso didn't dump you. Man City wanted you back.
No, no. Lasso could have stopped it, but he didn't. Yeah.
Just let me finish, yeah?
I dated a lot of girls, right?
But you, you saw an even greater Jamie inside an already great Jamie.
You made me cultured. Took me to plays and shit.
You hated all of that.
Yeah, 'cause it's confusing.
They do all these emotional things, make you feel all these emotional ways.
And then they get mad when you start trying to shout out and talk to them during a performance.
It's weird.
You also taught me to try to not get in me own way so much.
So... thank you for that.
You're welcome, Jamie.
You know, this is the first time you've been over to this house and you haven't sent me some, like, weird sex emoji.
Like the eggplant or the squirting water.
Or the little squirrel.
The little squirrel. I never understood that one.
Well, he's holding a little nut, isn't he?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He is. Yeah.
Right.
Do you wanna have a drink with me?
Nah.
Unless by "drink" you mean...
So that's how you get sex?
By not trying for sex?
Sometimes that is exactly how it works.
I never knew that.
Morning, boss.
Now, you don't just get biscuits today.
I also got you a little box of chocolate truffles.
Oh, you fucker. Don't do this to me.
What you should do is take one of them truffles and smoosh it in between the biscuits like it's a little breakfast sandwich-- Yeah, there you go. You got it.
Yeah.
Yeah. And hey, I wanna thank you again for being there for me up in Liverpool.
It was nothing, Ted.
No, no. It was something.
You got a coupon for life, young lady. Yeah. I got your back.
Think of me as your own personal metaphorical Saint Bernard.
You don't need to be dealing with a metaphorical avalanche to avail yourself to the metaphorical bourbon hanging around my neck.
Metaphorically speaking. Okay?
All right now.
Actually, Ted.
If you do want to be there for me, I have a meeting later with two minority owners of the club.
The Milk sisters.
The most horrible human cocktail of being terribly dull and yet, they never shut up.
Please join me.
Done and doner.
Perfect. I can just introduce you all, leave you wittering on, and slip out and do anything else.
How much of the club they own?
2.9%.
I'm gonna round that down to two. Then I can call those gals the "2% Milks." Oh, God. They're gonna adore you.
It's gonna be fun. All right. I'll leave you be. See ya now.
In my experience, I've always found that endorsements work best if you really believe in the product.
So, I can find good opportunities for you guys if you let me know what you're into.
I love Air Jordans.
I'd fuck a pair of Jordans.
All right. So, athletic wear then, yeah?
I'm into issue-oriented products.
You know, pro-environment or anti-pollution.
That kind of thing.
Oh, and also Air Jordans.
But I don't want to sleep with them.
Isaac, what about you?
Rolos.
So, sweets and chocolate then?
No. Just Rolos, yeah?
And none of that Sour Patch bullshit either, yeah?
Okay.
Well, that's a great start from you guys. Thank you.
Hey, Captain.
What's all this?
Rebecca's letting me use this room as my office until she sets me up with somewhere proper. That's why I have this.
So if they need to use the room, I can just shove everything into it.
Efficient. Do you want to see a movie later?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What?
I asked you if you wanted to go get coffee with me yesterday and you said you were busy.
I was busy.
You never texted me back last night.
Yeah. I was busy.
What about the kiss? You took off like it was a shit kiss, and it was not a shit kiss. I was on fire.
I agree.
So what is your fucking problem, Roy?
Listen, I'm a professional footballer.
I have had a million one-night stands.
So have I.
Great.
I don't know why we're bragging about it.
Neither do I.
And they always feel empty. Well, not the first part.
No, at first they're wicked.
They're fucking great.
But when it's all done, I feel like-- Like shit.
Exactly. And I always end up with my watch being stolen or a story in the press about how my penis has a curve in it.
Does it actually?
No, I just make it feel like it does with my hips.
Anyway, the point is, I'm trying to do this differently.
I should have told you that. I apologize.
And I am trying to be more honest.
Thank you.
Okay, then.
I think you should know that I slept with Jamie.
Yes, I am aware of that.
I mean last night.
I didn't think you were into me.
I didn't know what you wanted, and I knew exactly what he wanted.
So you fucked him to get back at me for something I didn't even know I did.
No. I-- No.
No.
Yes.
Yup. That's exactly what I did.
I fucked up, Roy. I'm really sorry.
But I need you to be okay with this.
Well, why don't you just come and tell me how you feel about it once you've figured out how to speak again?
Hi, Roy.
Something on your mind?
Is that grunt all I get to go on?
That's okay. I'll give it a shot here. Let's see.
You are thinking about buying your first house.
No, not that. Okay.
You just realized your dad might be a little racist.
Stop. He's in his 60s and he's from South London.
Of course my dad's a little racist.
Look, me and Keeley might be starting up a thing, but every time I think about her, all I think about is Jamie fucking Tartt.
Sounds to me like someone's trapped inside life's most complicated shape.
A love triangle.
Second place of course is the "I just walked in on my mother-in-law changing into her swimsuit" dodecahedron.
Does my face look like it's in the mood for shape-based jokes?
No, Roy, it does not.
But, in my defense, it rarely does.
I know exactly what to do here, though.
What are you doing?
Don't you fret, my fine furry fella.
In a matter of minutes, your relationship dilemma will be in the past.
For I am rounding up the Diamond Dogs.
Who the fuck are the Diamond Dogs?
It's just a group of people who care, Roy.
Not unlike folks at a hip-hop concert whose hands are not in the air.
Okay, so this is about you and Keeley, right?
Saw this coming.
Nothing like the early days of courtship.
Okay, this is my fucking nightmare.
I think the idea of you and Keeley is like cookies and cream.
And I think we all agree, two great tastes that go great together, right?
Yeah.
Perfect analogy.
Yes, I am into her. But we all know who her ex-boyfriend is.
The prince prick of all pricks.
And I've got him stuck right in here.
I don't understand the problem.
I mean, Keeley's just so kind.
You know, to be liked by someone like her must be... 's wonderful.
Shout out to the Gershwin brothers right there.
Fuck yeah, the Gershwins.
But dang it, fellas, you're still not getting it!
Thank you.
Sure, Roy here has slept with a bunch of different people in his past.
But Keeley's got her own romantic and sexual history that predates Roy.
And that's not okay!
He means the opposite.
I love it when Coach does sarcasm.
I can't control my feelings.
Well, then by all means you should let them control you.
He's doing it again.
Good eye.
Look, Roy, all this Chandler Bing-ing aside, do me a favor.
Don't let her past muck around with y'all's future, okay?
She slept with him last night.
I mean, are you two officially dating?
No.
Have you already slept together?
No.
Coach, you wanna bring this home?
Grow up and get over it.
The Diamond Dogs have struck again.
You're all pricks.
All righty. See the Milk sisters anywhere?
You want me to go skim the back room?
Don't make me regret this, Ted.
Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm gonna be an udder gentleman, okay?
Hey, I wonder if they've ever seen the movie <i>Bridget Jones's Dairy</i>.
Sorry, that's not my breast milk pun. I can do better.
Oh, my God, this was a horrible idea. Seriously, please go home.
Come on. It's gonna be fun.
Stop.
There she is.
Rupert, what are you doing here?
We came to celebrate.
Rebecca, Rebecca. Rebecca, Rebecca.
It's nice to see you again.
And this is Ted.
Howdy.
Yeah. Join us for a drink.
Here you go, Rupert. Anything else?
A couple more glasses for our friends here. Thank you, Mae.
You are as delicious as ever. From your West End to your Marble Arch.
Keep your Big Ben in your pants.
Thank you for your invitation, but we're actually here to meet with the Milk sisters.
They won't be coming now.
Oh, no. Did they expire?
What?
So, yeah, I...
I know I'm not allowed an ownership stake in the club, but they were nice enough to sell their minority share to Bex here.
I always thought I'd finish paying off my student loans before I purchased a football club.
Obviously, she needed a little financial aid from yours truly.
But, well, when we're married, what's hers will be mine and what's mine... well, that'll stay mine 'cause I've learned from you.
You're engaged?
Hey. Congratulations.
So you better join us for a drink.
Everyone! Drinks with us. It's on me.
Three lagers, please, Mae. They're free. We want the boots.
To Richmond!
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!
Right. The product you'd most like to get into business with is joy?
<i>Sí. Mucho, mucho</i> joy.
I don't know if I can get you paid for that though, Dani.
I like to give away joy for free.
All right, thanks, Dani.
You're welcome.
Hey. Football is life, <i>Capitán.</i> Yup.
I'm done being mad about Jamie.
I'm a grown man. I'm not a baby child.
I'm over it.
Right. Would you mind saying that to the rest of the room?
I mean, the press deserves to know.
Mr. Kent!
Yeah.
Hi. Keeley Jones, The Independent Woman.
Would you please repeat what you just said?
I'm over it.
Can I take you out tonight? Please?
Yeah. You.
Keeley Jones, The Independent Woman Online Edition.
So, why should I trust this sudden change of heart?
'Cause I like you more than I hate him.
I mean, barely. It's very close.
Yeah. Woman with the hair.
Keeley Jones, The Independent Woman Magazine.
Where would you take me if I did say yes?
I don't know. Coffee?
Can't do any better?
Dinner.
Yeah, that sounds great.
Yeah, woman with the fucking eyes.
Keeley Jones, The Independent Woman insert on Sunday.
Could you please elaborate on the hip movement that makes your penis feel like it has a curve in it?
Right, no more questions. We'll see you on the pitch.
To Rupert!
Friends, Richmonds, countrymen.
Our club's nightmare is over now. I'm back.
Thank God. 'Cause Ted Lasso sucks.
No offense, Ted.
All good, Baz.
You, Jeremy, and Paul have been refreshingly candid about y'all's feelings.
Pretty cool Premier League gaffer knows our names.
I know, right?
Shut up, you twats.
I'm trying again. No help.
Right. So, if she hits the board, I want it to sound like we just won the FA Cup.
You wanna leave?
I don't wanna give him the satisfaction.
So, Rebecca, it's time to be friends again.
Especially since Bex and I are gonna be sitting with you every week in that owner's box.
I'm not going every week.
Well, I am.
And every week, when they shove a camera in my face and ask me how I think you're doing, I will tell them.
It'll be relentless.
So, Rupert, y'all take your darts over here pretty seriously, huh?
This and... what's the billiard game y'all do that sounds like a brand of cookies?
Snooker?
That's it. That's the one, yup.
Boy, I'd love to curl up on a couch under a weighted blanket, watch <i>You've Got Mail</i> and devour a box of Snookers.
See what we got here.
Hey! There it is.
Do you like darts, Ted?
They're okay.
I'm more of a, you know, cornhole man myself. Yeah.
How about a game?
We could, you know, maybe wager, say, £10,000?
Well, as my doctor told me when I got addicted to fettuccine Alfredo, that's a little rich for my blood.
How about this? If you win, I'll let you pick the starting lineup of the last two games of the season.
But if I win, you can't go anywhere near the owner's box, at least not while Rebecca's still in charge.
Ted.
What the hell are you doing?
I believe some folks call it white knighting, but I'm just following my gut here.
It's okay.
No. Ted.
What do you think?
You're on.
Okay.
Double in, double out.
Whatever you say, Rupe-a-dupes. Yeah.
Just let me know if I'm winning or losing, all right?
I forgot I had these on me.
Yeah. Wait a second.
I forgot I'm left-handed.
This is gonna be a hoot.
So where are we going for dinner?
It's a surprise.
Cool.
I need to ask you something.
So, the other day when you said you were too busy to text me back...
Yeah, 'cause I was busy.
But you never told me what you were too busy with.
Yeah, 'cause it was private.
Are you dating other people?
It's okay if you are. It's just that I wanna know so that I don't look stupid.
It was yoga, okay?
I do yoga with a group of women in their 60s.
They have no idea who I am, it's twice a week and it's really good for my core.
Normally only takes an hour, but Maureen's been going through a divorce and she needed to talk about it and blow off some steam.
We all ended up at G-A-Y till 2:00 a. m.
and then we had crepes in Balham with some drag queens.
Like I said, it's private.
I'm gonna kiss you now.
Unless it's gonna make you run away again.
I know that you wanna take this slow and I really do respect that, but it-- Maybe I could just touch your arse a little bit or you could touch mine-- Where's your manners?
You're supposed to ask before you take something.
For example, may I take this?
No.
Well, I'm fucking taking it.
Here. It's pictures of our first date.
Come on. I'm cooking for you.
One hundred and eighty!
Well in, Rupert. Get in!
Shut your stupid little twat mouth or I will shut it for you.
Shall I be giving you the lineup card now, Ted?
I shall be putting Obisanya back on defense where he belongs.
That's exactly what I said, didn't I?
Now, now, it's not all Ted's fault.
My ex-wife's the one who brought the hillbilly to our shores.
I know she's always been a bit randy, but I never thought she would fuck over an entire team.
Hey!
Better manners when I'm holding a dart.
Please.
Mae. What do I need to win?
Two triple 20s and a bull's-eye.
Good luck.
You know, Rupert, guys have underestimated me my entire life.
And for years, I never understood why. It used to really bother me.
But then one day, I was driving my little boy to school and I saw this quote by Walt Whitman and it was painted on the wall there.
It said, "Be curious, not judgmental." I like that.
So I get back in my car and I'm driving to work, and all of a sudden it hits me.
All them fellas that used to belittle me, not a single one of them were curious.
They thought they had everything all figured out.
So they judged everything, and they judged everyone.
And I realized that their underestimating me...
who I was had nothing to do with it.
'Cause if they were curious, they would've asked questions.
You know?
Questions like, "Have you played a lot of darts, Ted?" To which I would've answered, "Yes, sir.
Every Sunday afternoon at a sports bar with my father, from age ten till I was 16, when he passed away." Barbecue sauce.
Good game, Rupert.
Come on, let's go.
You are a very lovely consolation prize.
Rebecca, Ted, enjoy your evening.
Mae, as always.
Holy shit, that felt good.
That was fun. Yeah.
Only one thing left to do now.
What's that?
Do I have to?
Drinks are on me!
Fellas, I could watch you do this jaunty North Korean military thing you do all day, but I need a favor.
We'll die for you, Coach!
That's a little dramatic, Sam, but I see how you got there with me invoking the military and all.
Now here's what we're gonna do.
How many of you fellas ever seen <i>Sesame Street</i>?
Good morning, Higgins.
Good morning. One sec.
Yeah, that's good. Straighten up. All right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on one sec. Let me get in my spot.
Okay. Here it comes, here it comes. Let's go.
Hi, Ted.
Can't hear you!
Hi!
Yeah! Yeah!
We felt it, she felt it!
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah! Yeah!
Got up too fast.
Ted embarrassed the hell out of Rupert yesterday.
That's good.
Bit of bad news.
We have ten thousand unsold seats for the final match of the season.
Release them to the visitors.
But Rebecca, Man City will snap those up.
Our home stadium will be a sea of sky blue.
That'll kill Rupert.
It'll hurt our chances. We're on the brink of relegation.
Just do it, Higgins.
Oh, you know, fuck off!
Excuse me?
I'm sick of it.
You won't take away your pain by constantly punishing Rupert.
Where were these morals when you were having lunches with me so Rupert could have sex in our house?
I thought we were friends.
You had every opportunity to do the right thing and you never did.
Fucking pussy.
You're right. I deserve to carry that around. I do.
I should've been braver, and I'm sorry for that. I am.
But I'm saying this to you now. Stop it.
Or what?
I quit.
I know how this goes.
You'll come back, grovel for your job, and I'll take you back, but I will make your life just that little bit worse.
Hi.
You arranged for the photographer to take this.
Roy and I found it on a paparazzi camera card.
He said you hired him.
Don't deny it or pretend that you don't know.
Either you come clean to Ted or I'll do it for you.
 @@@@@@
<i>Lisa Cramlin here with Graham Paul,</i> <i>breaking down this afternoon's Richmond-Arsenal match.</i> <i>Welcome, Graham.</i> <i>Pleasure to be here, Lisa.</i> <i>So today was another tough day for Roy Kent in a stretch of bad days.</i> <i>In his last nine games, Kent has had...</i> <i>... while his turnovers have nearly doubled.</i> <i>And today, it was an ignominious own goal...</i> There you are.
Everyone gone?
Yes, sir. Well, except Rojas.
Darn kid's out on the practice pitch still doing drills.
What a fucking asshole.
Right?
Yeah.
Somebody order a Roy on the rocks, huh?
How we doing in here?
That is cold, man.
Just looking at you in there is making me all chilly inside.
Can you just tell me I fucked up and then go?
Not gonna do that, bud.
I lost us the game. I'm a piece of shit.
Easy now. You had a bad day. Big whoop.
"Big whoop"?
Yeah, big whoop.
You beating yourself up is like Woody Allen playing the clarinet.
I don't wanna hear it. All right?
So just, you know, knock it off. Go easy on yourself. Okay?
Hey. I got your back. Ain't nothing gonna change that.
Look at you in there, looking like a brunette Oscar the Grouch.
On or off?
Off.
<i>You gotta stop holding on, Roy, please, for us, for you.</i> <i>Let it go.</i> <i>There you go.</i> <i>Hola,</i> Roy.
<i>We're taking a break. When we return,</i> <i>we'll take a look at Jamie Tartt's brilliant day for Manchester City.</i> That's it. Right there. Yep. Beautiful.
Oh, snap. Watch your back, Kate Moss.
There's a new bad girl on the British modeling scene.
Huh? Yeah?
Okay, I think we've got it.
Brought these in case you need a little biscuit boost. Yeah?
Man, oh, man. You get nervous doing this kind of stuff?
It's a profile on women in football. It's not a big deal.
There's, like, four of us: me, Karen, Delia and Posh Spice.
Come on, now. Being a role model's a huge deal.
Don't you realize that there's probably a little girl out there somewhere rocking a tiny eggplant-colored power suit, and she's just dreaming about becoming a sports executive someday.
She's gonna read this article and she's gonna think, "Holy smokes. My dreams are possible." In this scenario of yours, little girls read <i>The Football Financial Quarterly</i>?
Well, who knows? Little girls are mysterious.
And silly and powerful. I gave up trying to figure them out years ago.
Tell you what, I wish Higgins was here to see this, 'cause he'd be real happy for you too.
I don't know about that, Ted.
When Higgins decided to quit, he made it quite clear what he thought about me, and it wasn't supportive.
Nope. I'm filing that under stinkin' thinkin' right there. Okay?
I guarantee you, he'll come around.
Right. I'm changing the subject.
Go ahead.
How's the team morale going into the final weekend?
I mean, I'm still heartbroken about the last loss.
Are you?
Of course.
Hey, Keeley.
Hi, Ted.
Hey, did those marketing folks from Tom Ford ever get back to you?
Yeah, they did.
They said they're gonna stick with the models they already have.
Nuts.
I know. But they did say that if they ever do an everyman campaign or something satirical, your name's on their list.
All right. There you go. That's not bad.
Can I borrow you for a second, Rebecca?
Come on.
My God, it smells of feet in here.
I mean, it just hits you immediately, doesn't it?
It's hot. Like feet funk, right up your nose. Can you smell it?
You're being a right floppy cock, Rebecca.
Why haven't you told Ted yet?
I'm going to.
When?
Imagine doing something unforgivable to someone who doesn't deserve it and then having to look them in the eye and tell them what you've done.
I don't have to imagine. I've done it.
Year Eight, I took a shit in Joanna Wellington's locker.
I apologized, I was uninvited to her birthday party, and then we patched it up a week later.
Just fucking tell him.
Sorry, why did you do a shit in her locker?
I don't know. I was 13.
What? Teenage girls are, like, mysterious and dark and dangerous.
All right.
That is not the point!
Okay.
Oh, God.
Sorry. Wow.
I know women like shoes, but, girls, come on, this is silly.
Sorry, that was really sexist.
I just wasn't expecting there to be anyone in here.
But you are in here, and that's great.
Take as long as you need. Yeah. I'll go. Sorry.
I mean, what would be the point of telling Ted now?
It doesn't change anything.
It would change how I feel about you.
You know, David, we got one final game this season against Man City, and our goal is to go out like Willie Nelson, on a high.
Yeah?
How about Trent Crimm?
And if memory serves, you're from the <i>Daily Planet</i>, yeah?
Trent Crimm, <i>The Independent</i>.
Yes. That's the one. Okay. What's your question, Trent?
Many of your young players have improved during your tenure.
Then there's Roy Kent.
He played dismally last match. Thoughts?
Well, I think you could ask Roy himself. He'd tell you it wasn't his best day.
But I'll let you know right now that Roy Kent is the backbone of this team.
All right, let's mix it up in here a little.
If you're an introvert, I want y'all to raise your hand.
You guys get the next few questions.
That was a trick!
If y'all were really introverts, you would've been quiet as a church mouse.
Unless that church was Westboro Baptist. Those turkeys won't shut up.
Hi, guys. What's up?
Please have a seat.
Okay.
I feel like y'all are about to do some improv comedy or tell me that you're dating each other.
Either one's cool with me. 'Cause your suggestion is ally.
We have to take Roy out of the starting lineup.
I see. Okay.
It wasn't just one bad game, Coach.
He's showing his age, and he's made significant mistakes in each of the last five matches.
We just haven't been bitten in the ass by them yet.
But yesterday our butts had teeth marks.
Deep ones. The kind you usually have to pay for.
Guys... I'm not benching Roy.
He's our captain.
But I want you to know that I value each of your opinions.
Even when they're wrong.
I was really hoping it was going to be improv.
I'm Audi 5000.
You paid someone to bite you?
No, of course not.
Sorry. I...
Been paid.
Where?
Hey. What's up?
I have something I need to tell you.
I'm all ears.
Right, I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
I'm just gonna... get straight to the point.
No faffing around, 'cause that's just annoying, and definitely no procrastinating.
Procrast-- Procrast-- That's a good word, isn't it?
Procrastinating. Procrastinating.
I wonder what the etymology of that word is.
Obviously, "pro," very good, but "crast"? Crast...
I have no idea. Hey! Why don't we look it up?
Have you got a dictionary?
Not on me. Are you doing okay?
Me?
Yeah.
I'm brilliant!
Yeah, I am top of the pops.
Ted, do you think you could do this later?
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'll just hit the rewind button.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Just do it. Just do it. I'm a big girl.
I can fucking just-- Just tidy up your mess.
Tidy up your mess. Right. Oh, God.
Surprise.
Rupert.
You seem anxious.
Where's Higgins?
I fired him.
Why? Higgins is first class.
Except the only negative about the man was that whenever he borrowed a pen from me, he would nibble the top like some anxious little puppy.
Good boy.
Yeah, well, he's gone.
Shame. Oh, well. Maybe he'll accept my offer now.
Look, Rupert, are you here to try and buy back the club or-- No, I wanted to tell you something before you heard it somewhere else.
Bex and I are having a baby.
Surprise, again.
But you always said that-- I thought we could be mature about this.
You're mature enough, all right.
You're nearly 70, and you're having a baby?
I mean, what are you, a character from the fucking Bible?
When your kid hits puberty, you'll be nothing but a pile of dust and a black Amex card.
Now, now, darling.
Don't call me that.
People change. I do want a child.
I just suppose I didn't want one with...
Before.
I mean, in the end, it's just about being with the right person, isn't it?
Of course.
I'm so glad I got to tell you this in person.
I would have hated for you to read it in the press.
Good luck against Man City.
I have something I need to tell you.
Déjà vu.
I'm a fucking bitch.
Nope, that's new.
Ted, I lied to you.
I hired you because I wanted this team to lose.
I wanted you to fail, and I sabotaged you every chance I've had.
It was me who hired that photographer to take the photo of you and Keeley.
I set up the interview with Trent Crimm, hoping that he would humiliate you.
And I instigated the transfer of Jamie Tartt, even though you'd asked me not to.
This club is all that Rupert has ever cared about, and I wanted to destroy it.
To cause him as much pain and suffering as he has caused me.
And I didn't care who I used or who I hurt.
All you good people just trying to make a difference.
Ted, I'm so sorry.
If you want to quit or call the press, I'll completely understand.
I forgive you.
You-- What? Why?
Divorce is hard.
It doesn't matter if you're the one leaving or if... you're the one who got left.
It makes folks do crazy things.
Hell, I'm coaching soccer for heaven's sake. In London.
I mean, that's nuts.
Yeah.
But this job you gave me has changed my life.
It gave me the distance I needed to see what was really going on.
Yeah, but you and me...
We're okay.
Ted.
Come on, just shake this hand. My arm's starting to get-- You know, I think that if you care about someone and you got a little love in your heart, there ain't nothing you can't get through together.
You know what I'm saying?
You're not just talking about us now, are you?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Okay.
I'm gonna go change for practice-- training.
Whatever. Who cares?
Nice seeing you down here, boss.
You liven up the place.
All right, let's get it going, huh?
Let's go. Gather up. Come on, now.
All right, fellas, you gotta remember, your body is like day-old rice.
If it ain't warmed up properly, something real bad could happen.
Food poisoning is no joke.
One time, I was being sick, and at the same time, I was having diarrhea.
Yep. That'll happen. Anybody else wanna share?
To be able to do both those things at the same time?
The body is a miracle.
Yeah. Good perspective. I appreciate that.
So, fellas, we all know speed is important.
But being able to stop and change directions quickly?
Well, that's like Kanye's <i>808s & Heartbreak</i>.
It don't get nearly enough credit.
Okay, so let's line up on these cones Nate put out. Let's go.
All right, here's the deal.
Last one to start, stop, then start again is a rotten egg. Let's do it.
Hey, Coach, I thought of a joke this morning in the shower.
What does a British owl say?
Coach, what does a British owl-- I was saying earlier that-- You're acting like I'm chasing you with a booger or something.
Okay. All right. I see what's going on here.
This is about Roy, ain't it?
So you gonna give me the cold shoulder and the silent treatment. That's a combo.
Does it come with a medium drink?
Fine.
Hey, Nate, what does a British owl say?
You gonna do that move where you act like you don't hear me and then you just walk away, huh?
Yeah.
It's like that now, huh?
Heck with both of you guys. I'm just gonna focus up here on practice.
There you go, Dani. Dig in, baby. Come on.
Fuck.
It's all right, Roy.
Fuck!
Keep up, Roy!
You got this, Roy.
Fuck!
That's it. Swear it out, Roy. Swear it out.
Shoot.
Okay.
Yeah.
There you are.
Hey.
There's a lot of other seats.
Well, yeah, this is what my ticket says.
How you doing, Roy?
Fine. You?
Good, good, yeah.
I saw this video online of a kitten and a little baby chicken becoming friends and just hanging out together.
It was-- Well, here, let me show it to you. I got it right here.
What's this about?
It's funny, 'cause whenever my mom has something tough to talk about with me, she'll... you know, she'll start it off saying something about, I don't know, something weird, something overtly nice.
And, yeah, I just thought the idea of a cat and a bird being all simpatico was nice.
Look, Roy, we've been talking about the starting lineup against Man City-- Don't you dare. You're not fucking benching me.
Well, no. I'm just talking here, Roy. I-- Yeah, talking. That's all you do is talk.
Talking all that bullshit about how you've got my back.
No. Hey, I do have your back.
Bullshit!
You pretended to be a man of your word. You're fucking full of shit.
You can go fuck yourself. Fuck you!
There are a lot of surprises happening here.
Like that tiny little beard.
It's called a Van Dyke after the 17th century Flemish painter.
Right.
And I think it makes me look how I feel.
Chill.
How does Mrs. Higgins feel about it?
She hates it with a white-hot intensity.
Right. Look...
I came clean to Ted. I told him everything.
How did that go?
You know what the little shit did? He forgave me.
Fucking asshole.
I know.
But that's not actually why I'm here.
I wanted to apologize to you for...
treating you so poorly and forcing you to be an accomplice in my moronically childish scheme.
I am truly sorry, Higgins.
Wow.
Thank you, Rebecca.
I lost my way for a minute.
Yeah.
But I'm on the road back.
I can tell. You know what, it suits you.
Unlike that beard.
Sorry. Had to.
I don't think I've ever had a child in my house before.
What about Jamie?
We can't let her go snooping around though.
I don't want her to find my vibrator.
Yeah, that's gonna be a problem. Her mum said no electronics.
So, how are you doing?
Fine.
I do kind of think kids are pretty incredible.
I mean, she's got new teeth that push out her old teeth.
The body is a miracle.
You know, the last time I was on the bench...
You are ready to talk about real stuff.
That's great.
Wait one second.
Come sit here.
Take this.
Okay, we're both ready. Lay it on me.
Roy Kent has been the best player on every team he's been on since he was a kid.
I like being Roy Kent.
I don't know if I can handle just being some loser has-been called Roy.
"All right, Roy?" Yeah. "What you been up to?" Fuck all.
God. I think men who feel sorry for themselves are so sexy.
Stop it.
No, seriously. I do.
And if you start telling me how hard it is playing a game for a living, I think I might come.
It's not just a game to me.
It's all I've ever known.
It's who I am.
It's all I am.
Phoebe? Phoebe?
Can you come here for a second?
You were right. Zeppelin is amazing.
Wait till you hear Cream.
But first, I need you to close your eyes for me, yeah?
Okay. Can you describe your Uncle Roy?
Everything that you can think of. Go.
Well, he's my uncle. His beard is scratchy.
He buys me ice cream.
He swears a lot.
He's really funny.
And I love him.
Well done, Phoebe.
See? I didn't hear anything about being a footballer.
Who gives a shit what she has to say? She's six.
The point is, you don't know what people think about Roy Kent.
Secondly, all that matters, Roy Kent, is what you think about Roy.
That your old girl playing chess with some other bloke?
Yep.
That's fucking brutal.
She's just playing her game.
You stay strong, you hear?
You're a beautiful man.
Hey, fellas.
Well, that's a lot of pints just for us.
I thought you might've had a tough time with Roy.
Coach, you are a natural-born caregiver. Like Chief from <i>Cuckoo's Nest</i>.
I was always more of a Taber guy.
But if I'm being honest, I actually never got around to telling Roy.
Now, don't give me those eyes. He figured it out all on his own.
I can see you're happy now, but don't be.
'Cause I've been thinking about it and...
well, I'm starting Roy against Man City and that's that.
Look, putting him on the bench wouldn't just be humiliating to him, it could actually affect his livelihood.
And you know better than anyone that all this ain't about winning to me.
'Cause that ain't how we measure success, right?
Damn it, it is!
Hey. Who put a firecracker up your butt and lit it?
You did! And I'm sick of it.
Look, I understood this mission when we were in Kansas.
But those were kids and these are professionals and winning does matter to them.
And it matters to me. And that's okay.
Ain't that right, Mae?
A-fucking-men it is.
How do you not get it? Losing has repercussions.
We lose, we get relegated.
We get relegated, this is over and we will have built nothing.
And if you wanna pick a player's feelings over a coach's duty to make a point...
I don't wanna drink with someone that selfish.
That was the sexiest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
Get your things.
She's been toying with you.
Checkmate, mate.
I'm good.
You got a nut allergy?
I got a finger allergy.
What else have I got to offer you here? We got red wine.
We got tea.
Two-day-old pasta water.
Tea's fine.
Look, I'm sorry I told you to go fuck yourself.
I'm usually better at hiding my anger.
You think so, huh?
Know thyself.
Rest in peace, Socrates.
Told my niece I might not be playing.
She asked if we could go get ice cream.
Well, hey, at least you had someone you could talk to, right?
How was the ice cream?
Good. It's fucking ice cream.
Yeah, right? Ice cream's the best.
It's kinda like seeing Billy Joel perform live, you know?
It never disappoints.
It does give me the toots though.
The ice cream, not Billy Joel.
I asked her if she was still gonna watch the match if I wasn't playing.
Yeah?
Little shit said yes. Didn't even blink. Just straight into my face.
Well, hey. That's showbiz, ain't it?
I promised myself I was never gonna watch <i>Fresh Prince</i> again when they swapped out Aunt Vivs.
But truth be told, as long as they let Carlton do his thing, I was always gonna take a minute and just sit right there.
Sidebar: Alfonso Ribeiro, the greatest physical comedian of the 19th, 20th and 21st century.
Case in point right here.
Iconic, yeah?
I never know how to react when a grown man does the Carlton in front of me.
You could see a silhouette doing this, you know exactly what it is, you know exactly who's doing it. It is the one, the only, Alfonso-- Knock it off!
Sorry, Ms. Shipley!
It has been a whole thing this last week.
Anyway. You know what we could do?
You've been hurt off and on all season.
Why don't we just say you're injured, you can't play? No shame in that.
That would help protect my stock if I wanna move next season.
Maybe to a club that actually wants to start me.
Come on.
What if, God forbid, I end up having to play in fucking America, where I'd dominate, by the way.
They'd be like, "Oh, is this football then?" Well, obviously, my preference would be to have you there.
At practice tomorrow and the game.
But hey, you gotta do what's right for you.
Can I think about it?
I'd call you a big dummy, poo-poo face if you didn't.
Be honest with me. It's a prank, right? The tea.
Like, when us tourist folks aren't around, y'all know this tastes like garbage.
No. I love it.
You don't love it. It's pigeon sweat.
Horrible. Horrible.
Yeah.
No, get rid of the small one and bring back the tall one. He's got bigger hands.
It's biscuits o'clock.
Higgins! You're back!
Yeah!
All right. Well, hey, I know I may be a little too old-school for some folks, but I'm gonna say it anyway. Hell to the yeah.
Good to see you.
Nice to see you too.
Here you go, boss. Those are yours.
Thank you, Ted.
You've got to try one of these.
No, he does not. Caring is sharing, but I brought Higgins his own.
What?
How did you know?
Well, I had a hunch you were gonna be here.
Yeah.
Wow.
Actually, those were for Trent Crimm's daughter. She turns three today.
But it means more to me if you had 'em.
What? No. No, no. Come on.
No. It's okay. She won't remember.
Ted, you've already told her?
Yeah, weeks ago. She's been looking forward to it.
But she's three. She'll bounce right back. It'll be fine.
No way.
No, no. I insist. I insist.
I'm screwing with you. I'm just messing around.
I predicted this whole thing, and I made those myself for you.
Thank you.
Okay, y'all. I'll see you in a little bit, okay? Let's go, Greyhounds.
Yeah, these are definitely for a little girl.
Maybe he thinks you're silly and playful and mysterious.
Oh, sure.
Okay, fellas! Need y'all to listen up.
Coach.
Now-- I know now's not the best time, Coach, but I have been feeling physically sick since walking away from you the other day.
Plus last night, I had a horrible nightmare that I was pecking you to death like a crow.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay, Nate. We're all good in the hood, all right?
Yeah.
But hey, but do me a favor.
Try to apologize to me in your dream so we're good on that side of things too.
Yeah. Of course.
Thank you.
Now, fellas, we got ourselves a heck of a match comin' up, yeah?
And what I'm gonna need from all of y'all-- Sorry, mate.
My six-year-old niece found my girlfriend's vibrator.
So I had to take her to get her ears pierced in an attempt to erase the memory.
Been there.
Can I say something?
Floor is yours, Captain.
Second team's gonna kick first team's fucking asses today.
All right, fellas! Finish getting ready, and then we'll do what the man says.
We'll settle this out on the pitch. Let's go.
 @@@@@@
Right.
Who the hell are you?
Oh, hi! Hello. I'm Will. I'm the new clubhouse attendant.
No, you're not. I'm the clubhouse attendant.
Hey, Higgins, where are you?
Ted, what the fuck's going on?
I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out myself.
Figure what out? Have I been sacked?
Has he been fired?
I don't know anything about this, Ted.
There you are.
There you are.
Is this because I called Isaac a pussy?
I don't know-- Good morning, everyone.
You shrew. You did this, didn't you?
Why so hostile, Nathan?
Right, I'll tell you why-- You know my name?
Well, I had to spell it correctly for your contract.
Nate-dawg, you haven't been fired. It's worse.
You've been promoted.
Nate! Nate! Nate!
Nathan Shelley, I present to you this whistle.
But it is sad. Do you know why?
No.
Because it has never been blown.
Is that the same reason why Colin's sad?
By the power vested in me by the Associative Football Club of Richmond, I now pronounce you Coach Nate.
Thanks a lot. Thank you.
No, no! Not inside.
Sorry. Sorry.
It got confusing, 'cause they don't call it jock itch here.
So you didn't know what spray to buy?
Yeah.
Yeah. What'd you go with?
Mr Muscle.
Huh.
Hey, Roy.
Not sure if you know this, but the rules say you gotta pick a new captain.
Oh.
No, sir. You're my captain. That's the rule.
No. The captain has to be on the pitch. That's the rule.
I say that the current captain has to pick the new captain.
That's my new rule.
Don't want to.
Well, you have to.
I decline.
I insist.
Can't make me.
Roy Kent, until you choose your successor, your duties as captain of this squad remain unfulfilled.
This is why it's hard to love you.
You heard it, right?
He loves you.
All right, gang. Here's the unskinny bop.
Manchester City is coming into our house for the final match, but preparation-wise, we gonna treat it like it's any other game.
But it's not just any other game. We could get relegated.
We got relegated when I was at Cardiff. It's my family's team.
My nana never spoke to me after that.
She just left me a box of her shit in her will.
Yeah, and when clubs go down, teams get broken up.
Coach, do they not have relegation in America?
Oh, no, no, no.
So what happens to all the shit teams at the end of the season?
They play out the rest of the schedule, going through the motions in meaningless games contested in lifeless, half-empty stadiums, and everyone's pretty much fine with that.
That sound about right, Coach?
Yeah, it's dumb.
All right. Now, Coach Nate-- No, no, no.
Not-- No, not here.
Not inside.
I was saying, now Coach Nate has a video he wants to show.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Okay. So, I thought you'd all find this motivational.
All right.
<i>Amigo</i> Jamie.
Clearly no barbers in Manchester.
<i>Well, I'd never say a bad word about me old club...</i> <i>even though I did carry them through every match.</i> <i>But they're good lads.</i> <i>Apart from Roy Kent. He is a knob.</i> <i>You know, and it's nice to have a real manager like Pep,</i> <i>instead of that American rodeo clown.</i> <i>You know, Lasso sent me away, now they're facing the drop.</i> <i>Sunday, I get to put the final nail in the ashes.</i> <i>Instant karma, it's gonna get ya.</i> Oops, innit?
Well said.
All right, let's go climb that mountain!
<i>Okay, so if the Premier League is the best,</i> then what's the league called right below it?
The Championship.
Now, hold on one second. So if you come in last place in the Premier League, you get to play in the Championship?
They also invented irony.
Man, this town has got a weird way with words, don't it?
I mean, come on, y'all. It's 2020. Let's just call 'em cigarettes.
Oh, God, yeah.
You know what I mean?
Hey. How you doing, fellas?
We just wanted to say thanks.
Yeah, we know you did your best.
Even though your best is still shit.
Baz.
Oh, come on, now.
You're acting like we lost the game already, yeah?
Why don't you have a little hope?
Aw, Ted. Haven't you lived here long enough to realize?
It's the hope that kills you.
Why don't you text Nate? We got a little work to do tonight, huh?
Okay, come on. We got this. Look, we win, we're in, okay?
There is a scenario where Crystal Palace beat Norwich by six goals, and we avoid relegation with just a tie.
No, no, no. Nope. Sorry.
No. I hate ties, Nate.
How many times I gotta tell you that? They ain't natural, all right?
If God wanted games to end in a tie, she wouldn't have invented numbers, all right?
Come on, guys. Let's fire up. Let's go.
For the love of Meghan Markle, do not blow that whistle again, Nate. I swear.
Sorry.
I got neighbors upstairs, and they will just start stomping away. Okay?
Come on. Tell me how we beat Manchester City.
We cannot beat Manchester City.
Dang it, Nate!
That is not what I want to hear from my assistant coach on his first day.
It is hopeless.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's hopeless?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Quick question. Are those the only clothes you own?
This? No, I got three of these.
That ring a bell, Nate? That ring a very large bell in your head?
You had that hanging in your home?
I got a ton of these hanging up in here. This one's from the bathroom mirror.
It's the first thing I see every morning, and it's the last thing I see at night when I rationalize being too tired to floss.
Belief can't score goals, Coach.
Well, hello, Nelson.
Let me introduce you to another Nelson right here.
I think you two will hit it off just fine, 'cause you're both so damn pessimistic!
Sorry, Ms. Shipley!
I believe the gentleman is suggesting that we are a pair of Negative Nellies.
Oh, right.
Jackpot.
Morning, boss. Here you are.
Oh. Ted. I sense you're carrying around something today besides biscuits.
Good eye, small fry.
I hate to say it, Rebecca, but I think your football club might have been better off with a soccer coach.
Where's this coming from?
Look, if we do end up losing on Sunday, you just go ahead and do whatever you think is best for the future of this club, you understand?
Even if that means this guy's gotta go...
You know, you put that thing, and just... You know, whatever you got.
Whatever you wanna do. I mean, don't really murder me, but, you know, just... All that. You get what I'm getting at?
Fire me. You get the gist. Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
So you think you're not a "proper" football manager.
Someone who's never played the game before, or knows the rules.
No, I don't know jack diddly about any of it.
But who cares? There's a great saying in Dutch football.
Oh, I don't speak Dutch.
That's why I was going to tell you in English.
Perfect. Lay it on me.
"Every disadvantage has its advantage." Ooh, I like that.
Sure, you don't know what you're doing, but doesn't that mean that you see the game in a different way than any other football manager?
And shouldn't that empower you to cause complete and utter confusion?
Cause confusion or create chaos.
Yep. Yes, it is. Thanks, boss.
I'm fine.
Oh, my God.
The chaos has already begun.
All right, gentlemen. School is in session.
And today's lesson is "trick plays." At least, that's what we call 'em back home.
What do they call 'em here again?
Elaborate set pieces.
Yeah, we gonna stick with "trick plays." That's a lot more fun.
Now, the idea behind every trick play is to have chaos rain down upon your opponents and stun them.
Much like the lava did to those poor folks in Pompeii.
So, I want y'all to think about every single trick play you have ever run your entire time playing this sport. Anybody got one?
Yeah, Dani, what you got?
When I played for Tigres, we had a great set piece.
Did it have a name?
"The Sandman." Yeah. Now we're cooking. "The Sandman." We're gonna learn that play today. Who else got one?
"Pepper Shakers." "Pepper Shakers"?
Yeah, plural. Gotta be two.
"Beckham's Todger." Beckham, I know. Todger, I don't know.
It's dirty.
Okay.
"Midnight Poutine." Poutine?
That's not dirty.
It's just super Canadian.
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang." Oh, with Dick Van Dyke.
The owner of one of the most authentic English accents in the history of cinema.
What do you got?
"The Broken Tap." All right. That's not a complaint, that's an actual play name?
Think Man City will leak a lot of goals from it.
Whoa!
Oh. Nice. Yeah?
"Loki's Toboggan." "The Upside-Down Taxi." "Hadrian's Wall." "Dirty Martini." Oh, I'd love to run that play three times right now. I love it.
Do me a favor and toss "Lasso Special" up there just for the heck of it too.
All right, guys. Tell you right now, we're gonna go out there, and we're gonna learn a bunch of these plays, you hear?
Come Sunday, we're gonna hit Man City with the chaos hammer!
Yeah!
Let's go!
No. Sam, not wax.
Ah, okay.
Pomade. Pomade.
Yo, Jamie Tartt. It's you, yeah?
Let me get an ussie.
A what?
Oh.
Wicked.
I can't believe you got dumped by Richmond.
Super embarrassing for you, yeah?
Well, I got fucked by Lasso. So...
He likes you now though. He talked about you on telly, didn't he?
What are you on about, you posh twat?
<i>Trent Crimm,</i> The Independent. <i>Any bad blood between you and Jamie Tartt?</i> <i>Jamie? No. That's a special young man right there.</i> <i>Got talent for days, works hard,</i> <i>and he's got a jawline like the White Cliffs of Dover.</i> <i>I'm always rootin' for him.</i> What?
Classic mind games, innit?
Right. You can fuck off.
Whoa!
You're fucking joking.
Oh, yeah, Roy, Jamie's coming over.
Oh, is he? Shall I make scones?
I don't like scones.
I'm not making scones, you idiot.
Good, 'cause I don't even like 'em.
What's that?
I made you coffee.
Well, then, what's this?
I brought you coffee.
Oh.
All right, Jamie, what was it that you wanted to talk about?
Not gonna say it in front of this dry old shit.
Why? He won't say anything. Will you?
Missed.
Ted Lasso is trying to play fucking mind games with me.
Saying nice shit about me on the telly. Trying to get in my head.
He does like you.
You're as full of shit as he is.
Oi. Mind your fucking manners.
All right, RoboCop.
Jamie, not everyone in your life is out to get you.
I am.
What? Thought you respected honesty.
I do.
Oh, that is disgusting.
Look, Keeley. When you're done feeding mushy peas to this old fart, then you give me a call.
Look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Enjoy the view from the bench.
What?
Well, now I want mushy peas.
<i>Dad, when I see you coach soccer on TV,</i> <i>it doesn't look like you're doing anything.</i> Well, it's 'cause I'm not. All right?
It ain't like being a football coach back home, kiddo.
I got a lot less control, 'cause once the game gets going, I can't tell my fellas what to do.
So I just gotta hope that everything I've been trying to teach 'em made some sort of impact on 'em, and that they'll make the right decisions when they're out there on their own.
You know, it's kind of like being a dad, I guess, huh?
How much did you get of that before you checked out?
<i>I drew a robot.</i> That's cool, bud.
<i>The Richmond faithful gather on a crucial night.</i> <i>Win and they stay up. Lose and they go down.</i> <i>They come here full of hope, but as they know all too well,</i> <i>it's the hope that kills you.</i> Oh, this sport.
I'd forgotten how stressful it is when you actually give a shit.
I have a confession to make.
I've never really cared about football.
I know. I know it sounds insane, but I know how to act at a match.
"Referee!" "Offside, you turnip!" God, you're awful.
You believed me.
It's just that my heart has never really been in it, you know?
But today...
today, I care very much.
Arlo White here, with former England international, Chris Powell, live from the Dogtrack, Nelson Road Stadium, the home of AFC Richmond, <i>who tonight host the mighty Manchester City.</i> Yoo-hoo! You like my new shirt?
Well, look at you.
<i>It's David meets Goliath.</i> <i>If David forgot to put his stone in his slingshot, Arlo.</i> These are on me.
Thanks, Mae.
Good luck group hug?
No.
Richmond.
Richmond.
Okay, here we are. Family Higgins.
This is Terry, Kris, Dana, Stevie.
How many kids do you have, Higgins? Jesus Christ.
And this is our eldest, Lindsay.
Good evening.
Forgive me, Father.
Don't worry. He's a cool priest.
When your parents have you out of wedlock, it allows you space to explore life's little gray areas.
Come on, Richmond!
Come on!
<i>With the Richmond fans in full voice, Chris,</i> <i>how do the players in the locker room feel to be on the brink of relegation?</i> <i>It's a tremendous amount of pressure, Arlo.</i> <i>To get the result they need, it will have to start with veteran leadership.</i> Isaac.
Yeah?
Never stop breaking TVs.
All right, now, fellas. Hey, let's focus up, huh?
So I've been hearing this phrase y'all got over here that I ain't too crazy about.
"It's the hope that kills you." Y'all know that?
I disagree, you know?
I think it's the lack of hope that comes and gets you.
See, I believe in hope.
I believe in belief.
Now, where I'm from, we got a saying too, yeah?
A question, actually.
"Do you believe in miracles?" Now, I don't need y'all to answer that question for me...
but I do want you to answer that question for yourselves.
Right now.
Do you believe in miracles?
And if you do...
then I want y'all to circle up with me right now. Come on. Let's go.
Get 'em in here.
All right, Captain. Let 'em know.
Let's go, Skipper, let's go.
All right, Captain. Let 'em know.
Richmond on 12.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, eleven, twelve!
Richmond!
Go Richmond!
Let's go!
Is that miracle thing from a movie or real life?
Both.
Among the many subplots, the return of Jamie Tartt, <i>who enjoyed a successful loan period here,</i> <i>but had an infamous on-pitch dustup with Roy Kent, who is not starting today.</i> <i>I really can't remember</i> <i>seeing Roy Kent on the bench for a big match.</i> Hey, Jamie! Good luck!
Fucking mind games.
<i>It's Richmond versus Manchester City.</i> And we're off.
Here we go.
<i>Hendrick takes. Outside for Corwin.</i> <i>Oh, and he puts Tartt through on goal.</i> No, no, no.
<i>He has a man open to his left.</i> <i>But he takes it himself!</i> <i>And Zoreaux is there.</i> Nice stop!
That's a solid save from Zorro.
Yeah, Chris. It's pronounced "Zoreaux." <i>Thirty minutes gone. Richmond with an opportunity here on the counterattack.</i> <i>Obisanya with an inch-perfect through ball.</i> <i>Winchester was clearly offside.</i> Come on, now!
Explain to me how that's offsides.
What?
No, I'm serious. How is that offside? I don't understand that yet. You-- <i>And here comes Lasso's assistant coach to review their tactics.</i> <i>What chess moves do they have in store?</i> When the vinegar was next to the Heineken, they weren't offside.
It's not when the vinegar catches the ball, it's when ketchup passes the ball.
Yes, I understand now.
Okay.
<i>A shot from Dixon-- Pushed over the bar.</i> Corner, corner!
<i>Agony for Dixon, but a corner for Richmond.</i> Come on, Richmond!
Corner kick, corner kick.
Go for the Sandman. Call Sandman.
What? Sandman.
Sandman! Guys, the Sandman!
Sandman!
Here we go.
<i>Rojas to take the corner.</i> <i>It's a dummy. Oh, and another one. What is this?</i> <i>Dixon again!</i> <i>No! Hamlin saves with his foot.</i> Shit.
Ooh, baby, the Sandman almost rocked 'em to sleep right there.
<i>A bit of trickery from Ted Lasso.</i> <i>Haven't seen that one before.</i> Nice move though. Nice move.
<i>And that's halftime. The score is 0-0</i>.
<i>Shockingly, Richmond are still in this,</i> <i>thanks to the stellar play of Zoreaux in goal.</i> Okay, well, you got-- It's Reynolds.
No, you got to shore up your defense. You have to-- Okay, you know what? Never mind. I'm just gonna go with my gut.
Somebody check the Crystal Palace score.
Hey, no. No, no, no. Absolutely not.
I don't want to hear about any other game going on any other place.
Okay? Look, we are not playing for a tie.
Ain't nobody here gonna kiss their sister.
What?
Which is an American phrase that I'm now realizing does not exist here, and that's good, 'cause it's creepy, and I hate it myself, I don't know why I said it.
I think it's just the adrenaline, the nerves and all that.
But we are playing for a win.
Win and in. You hear?
I can't hear your nods. Do you hear me?
Yes, Coach.
Okay, good. All right. Roy, you are starting the second half.
Go ahead and start warming up. Let's go.
Gentlemen, follow me.
And here comes Roy Kent.
Roy-o!
<i>A surprising move from Lasso.</i> <i>Manchester City's speed is causing Richmond problems,</i> <i>and he brings on Roy Kent, who is, to be polite, very slow.</i> That's 'cause he's a fucking octogenarian. Look at him.
<i>City with a real opportunity here.</i> <i>Scharfenberg into the box.</i> <i>Oh, it's a penalty against Richmond.</i> How? How?
He didn't touch him!
<i>Zoreaux in position. Hendrick to take.</i> <i>He scores.</i> <i>City finally get past Zoreaux, and it's 1-0.</i> <i>It's the goal that's been coming.</i> <i>City take the lead, and the Dogtrack falls silent.</i> We're only one goal down. There's still a chance. Come on, Richmond!
I love you when you give a shit.
Go, Richmond!
<i>Jamie Tartt with the breakaway.</i> <i>If he scores here, it could be curtains for Richmond.</i> <i>No one can catch him.</i> Go, Roy, go!
<i>Hold on. Can you believe it? It's Kent!</i> Yeah! Attaboy, Roy!
Roy! Roy!
<i>Once again, the tortoise has stopped the hare.</i> That's how you put him down, Roy!
What's the matter?
He's not getting up.
<i>Now this looks serious.</i> <i>It was a fair tackle on Tartt, but Kent may have paid the price.</i> <i>And they're sending out the physio.</i> Get up, Roy!
Roy. Roy, are you okay?
Fuck. I fucked my knee.
Want me to call for the stretcher, Roy?
No, just help me up.
Roy Kent! He's here, he's there...
What the fuck are you doing?
... he's every-fucking-where. Roy Kent!
Listen.
Roy Kent! He's here, he's there, he's every-fucking-where. Roy Kent!
Roy Kent! He's here, he's there, he's every-fucking-where. Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
He's here, he's there, he's every-fucking-where.
Roy Kent!
<i>Well, we apologize for the fruity language as the crowd serenades Roy Kent</i> <i>with a song that's echoed through the Premier League for more than a decade.</i> He's here, he's there, he's every-fucking-where...
<i>And he's getting up.</i> Roy Kent!
<i>Roy Kent will never leave on a stretcher.</i> Roy Kent! He's here, he's there, he's every-fucking-where! Roy Kent!
Roy Kent!
He's here, he's there, he's every-fucking-where!
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
<i>As Kent comes off, he claps the fans in gratitude.</i> <i>Kent has been a fan favorite</i> <i>because he always left everything he had out on the pitch,</i> <i>and he did so tonight.</i> <i>Chris, does this almost feel like a farewell to you?</i> <i>Well, you have to wonder, Arlo.</i> <i>At his age, with that injury...</i> <i>Personally, I'm sorry to say,</i> <i>I think this may be the last time we ever see the great Roy Kent lace up his boots.</i> You're not allowed back here during a game.
I told you, you have to get out.
I mean it. Stay the fuck away from me.
What the heck is going on-- That's the sound of 26,000 people checking mobiles.
Oh, my God. Palace won 6-0.
But then that means...
All we need is a tie.
We just need a tie, boys!
We just need a tie!
Come on! Let's go!
Come on, Richmond!
Three minutes of added time is all that's left in Richmond's season.
<i>Montlaur runs left.</i> <i>Fouled hard by Scharfenberg.</i> There you go, Richard! You sell the crap outta that!
<i>Montlaur earns Richmond a late free kick.</i> I think he's making a meal of it, Arlo.
<i>City players do too.</i> <i>No, Chris. He's definitely hurt. No, no, he's absolutely fine.</i> Yeah!
Oi! Lasso Special! Lasso Special!
Holy smokes.
Lasso Special!
<i>Manchester City are more worried about yelling at the official</i> <i>than they are about... whatever it is Richmond are doing.</i> Hold on, hold on.
<i>Actually, what are they doing?</i> Ref! They can't do that! What are you doing?
They're gonna run it. I didn't even call it. They're gonna just run it!
<i>I don't know what's going on here, but it looks like...</i> <i>Is this American football?</i> What the fuck is that?
What's he doing?
<i>I've never seen anything like this.</i> Motion!
Get in line!
<i>Obisanya goes in motion.</i> <i>If Richmond are trying to confuse Manchester City,</i> <i>you have to say it's working.</i> <i>It's working on me too, Arlo.</i> Blue 48!
<i>Is Zoreaux yelling numbers and colors?</i> Hut, hut, hut! Hike!
One, two, three, four...
<i>The Richmond players fan out. City's defense is in chaos.</i> <i>And it's a Hail Mary to Obisanya, who is wide open!</i> <i>Rojas is all alone on the left.</i> Dani's onside.
Yeah, he is.
<i>Rojas!</i> Yes!
Yeah!
<i>The injury time equalizer from Dani Rojas,</i> <i>surely enough to keep Richmond in the Premier League!</i> We got a tie! We got a tie!
Yeah!
We're staying in!
Coach!
<i>Straight from the kickoff, City are back on the attack.</i> <i>There he is again. Tartt loses Winchester with ease.</i> <i>It's only him and the goalkeeper.</i> No.
<i>Oh, he makes the extra pass.</i> <i>Hendrick buries it.</i> <i>Manchester City win,</i> <i>and AFC Richmond's time in the Premier League is over.</i> <i>We can "woulda, coulda, shoulda" all day long,</i> <i>but that's-- it's a tough loss. It's a tough loss.</i> It's over.
<i>I do wanna congratulate Man City on their win though, and their coach, Pep.</i> <i>Boy, did he look sharp tonight. Yeah, my man...</i> You! Do you really think I would've come all the way down to London to watch my son pass the ball?
You could've scored the winner. You're better than that, Jamie. Fuck!
So, look, I-- Oh, I'm good. Thank you. Yeah.
Hey. Y'all played a heck of a game out there.
We may not have won, but y'all definitely succeeded.
I mean, you gave the champs 90 minutes of hell.
Zoreaux, where you at?
That dude had more saves than a Baptist preacher.
Give it up for Zoreaux. Yeah.
That's right. What about Roy? Roy chased down his grandson.
Stopped him from getting an easy one.
Now, look, this is a sad moment right here. For all of us.
And there ain't nothing I can say, standing in front of you right now, that can take that away.
But please do me this favor, will you?
Lift your heads up and look around this locker room.
Yeah?
Look at everybody else in here.
And I want you to be grateful that you're going through this sad moment with all these other folks.
Because I promise you, there is something worse out there than being sad, and that is being alone and being sad.
Ain't nobody in this room alone.
Sam, do you remember what animal has the shortest memory?
A goldfish.
That's right. It's a goldfish.
Sam, what do you think we should all do once we get done being sad and/or angry about this situation?
I think we should all be a goldfish.
I agree.
Let's be sad now. Let's be sad together.
And then we can be a gosh-darn goldfish.
Onward. Forward.
What do you want?
Night, Jamie.
A love letter?
We'll have a conversation about that.
Hey, y'all.
I'll leave you two to talk.
Thank you, Leslie.
Leslie? Is that your first name?
It was my mother's name. I'm what's known as a feminine junior.
Oh. Cool.
Please. Take a seat.
Tea?
No. Tea and I are still on a lifelong hiatus, yeah.
I'll take a little water though, please.
Well, Ted. That was certainly a heartbreaking result.
Yes, ma'am. And I've been thinking about it.
I think it's mighty unfair that you have to fire me, so...
If it's all the same to you, I'd like to spare you the trouble and just quit.
This here is my letter of resignation.
I wrote it on the back of a takeout menu, but it's in an envelope, and I signed it, so, you know, it's legit.
You listen to me, Coach Lasso.
You are not going anywhere, 'cause we have work to do next season.
Well, okay. All right, then.
Yeah. So, wait. Tell me this, though.
The teams that get relegated, they can get un-relegated, yeah?
They can get promoted.
So then, next year we get ourselves a promotion, which looks good on any résumé.
Then we come back to this league and...
we do something that no one believes we could ever do.
Win the whole fucking thing.
There you are.
The bubbles.
I'm sorry. Did I get you?
 @@@@@@
[Arlo] And we're in the final minute of added time.
AFC Richmond and Nottingham Forest are level with two goals apiece.
Obisanya switches play. He finds Rojas, who has room.
Oh!
[whistle blows] [Arlo] And it's a penalty!
[cheering] A giant opportunity for the Greyhounds to change their club's tide here.
Nice pass, Sam!
Here we go, Dani!
Yeah! Yes!
Nice, nice.
[Arlo] Huge relief for Colin Hughes after he was liable for Forest's equalizer.
Richmond has started the season with seven straight ties… and if this match ends in a draw, they will tie the record, which is currently a tie between Southampton and Swansea.
Chris, can you even imagine starting a season with seven consecutive draws?
I sure can, Arlo.
And that's because I'm a right-brained dominant with a knack for make-believe.
Is it okay if I pray?
Yeah, of course. But to which god and in what language, you know?
You could cross your fingers, make a wish.
There you go.
[Arlo] The Richmond faithful, who've recently gone through so much, still fervently behind their club.
Keep on him.
Ooh.
Go on. Yeah!
[Arlo] And a hush falls over Nelson Road… [dog howling] [bird wings flapping] [Arlo] With the exception of Richmond's venerable mascot, Earl Greyhound, howling his encouragement.
[whistle blows] Will Dani Rojas deliver the good boy their first win of the season?
Please, please, please, please.
Come on, Dani.
[breathes deeply] Football is life.
[Earl yelps] [crowd gasping] Oh!
Oh.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I promise that's not what I wished for.
[theme music plays] [sighs] That poor creature. It's so tragic.
Awful turn of events.
You don't think that people will hate us because of it, do you?
Well, it was obviously a horrible accident, but I guess that one perk of being in a lower division now is that not every game is televised.
Yes, but, Higgins, the Internet.
Oh, right, the goddamn Internet.
[sighs] Oi, Twitter is going bonkers. Look.
Oh, God. Did we really make Michael Jordan cry?
Did you write a statement for Ted?
Yeah, I did.
But then he said, "Now, don't you fret, Boba Fett." He's got it covered.
Okay.
Mmm. Mmm.
[journalists clamoring] Coach!
All right, Marcus, what do you got for me?
Coach Lasso, how are you feeling about the team's efforts today?
Well, I feel like everyone played their hearts out, especially Sam.
Just gets better and better every game.
He's really helping us fill that giant Roy Kent void, you know.
And how many more matches you think can end in a draw before you hit the panic button?
Well, Marcus, there's two buttons I never like to hit, all right?
And that's "panic" and "snooze." Who else?
[journalists clamoring] Uh, what about this fella right here?
Trent Crimm-- [journalists] The Independent.
I was wondering if you had any comments on Earl, the dog Dani Rojas killed today.
Mmm. Trent Crimm, bringing that heat. [chuckles] [sighs deeply] Yeah.
Well, when I was three years old, I got attacked by our neighbor's dog.
I don't remember it happening, but my mother said it was pretty-- pretty scary, you know.
I do remember being afraid of dogs while growing up though.
Like if I was at a friend's house for a sleepover or something, they'd have to keep their family dog outside, otherwise I'd bawl my eyes out.
[chuckles] [journalists chuckle] Then in high school, our neighbor, Mr. Grady, well, his wife passed away.
And he was real sad about that, as you can imagine, and he just kinda stopped taking care of their dog.
Same one that bit me. His name was Hank.
And so I started looking after him, you know.
Feeding him, taking him on walks, playing fetch, all that fun stuff.
Eventually, Mr. Grady's son moved his dad into a nursing home, and he asked if I wanted to keep Hank, and I was like, "Yeah. Heck, yeah." And then a year or so after that we had to put Hank to sleep.
It's funny to think about the things in your life… that can make you cry just knowing that they existed, can then become the same thing that make you cry knowing that they're now gone.
I think those things come into our lives… to help us get from one place to a better one.
And I hope we helped Earl do just that.
We gonna miss him around here a whole bunch. Yeah.
And how's Dani doing?
I haven't spoken with him yet, but I just hope he's not being too hard on himself, you know.
[praying in Spanish] He's been like this for 20 minutes.
He's gonna use all the hot water.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
[praying continues] Hey, Dani. What ya doing?
Washing the death off of me.
Well, I-- I recommend you use a little soap.
Helps get the eternal rest out of those tough-to-reach places, you know.
Gracias, Coach.
Well, hey, don't forget, football is life, right?
I know. It used to be.
[praying in Spanish] [mouthing] I got nothing.
Okay, so, fellas, let's go ahead and give Dani a little bit of space right now, yeah?
Y'all don't mind showering at home, do ya?
Ooh, Coach, uh, if it's okay with you, some of us prefer to take long baths at home.
[players] Yeah, yeah.
Oh. Yeah, no, okay, that'll work too.
Oh, and hey, way to play out there today.
Y'all kicked their butts from soup to nuts.
Don't worry, we gonna get a W soon.
We'll see you goldfish on Monday.
Goldfish?
Oh, it means to forget our mistakes and failures and just move on.
But I didn't make any mistakes. Only you played poorly.
[players] Ooh. Wow.
Hey, guys, Jan Maas is not being rude.
He's just being Dutch.
[player 1] Mm? Yeah, yeah.
[player 2] True.
[cell phone beeps, vibrates] [sighs] I'm telling you, all these ties are my fault.
It's straight up celestial payback for the Man City game.
There I was wishing and hoping for a freaking tie, and now the karma police are making good on showing me what I get when I mess with them.
The team's playing well, Ted, just a little unlucky, that's all.
"Unlucky." Yeah. Man, I love the way y'all use that word over here.
Back home, if a team was playing poorly, we don't call 'em unlucky.
What do we call 'em, Coach?
New York Jets.
There it is.
Hey, Coach.
Uh, sorry to interrupt. Uh, can I leave a little early today?
But part of your job is to stay until the whole team's gone.
No, yes, of course. It's just, it's my mum's 50th birthday-- Oh. Oh.
And w-what position does your mum play on the team again?
It's okay, Will. Uh, tell your mom a happy birthday from all of us, and if she ever wants to try out for the team, she's more than welcome.
Ah, lovely. [chuckles] [sighs] Y-You gotta stay on 'em.
Pressure makes pearls, right?
Mmm.
Wait, that's wrong.
It's diamonds-- Shit! I messed it up.
No, you didn't mess it up. You were just, uh-- Unlucky.
Yes!
[cell phone beeps] Ooh, thanks.
That's odd.
We just received a giant food delivery from our rivals over at Brentford F. C.
That's nice. What kind of food?
Thai.
Oh, now I get it.
[sighs] [knocks] Howdy, y'all.
[all] Ted!
What do you say to a cocktail, Coach Lasso?
Oh, the same thing I'd say to Diane Sawyer if she ever asked me out on a date: "Yes, please." Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Hmm.
How you feeling?
Well, Keeley, I feel like a bigger loser than the biggest loser from The Biggest Loser.
Oh, look on the bright side, Ted.
We are still undefeated.
Okay, sure. Thank you.
How's Dani doing?
Oh, he's a little shell-shocked, but Dani's a lot like an expensive tape measure.
He snaps back real quick.
[Rebecca] Hmm.
Yeah.
What about Earl's owner? He doing all right?
Yeah, fortunately he is.
Oh, good.
Yes, and you're now looking at the very new, very generous, very guilt-riddled benefactor of Richmond's largest dog shelter.
Barkingham Palace.
[Rebecca chuckles] Mmm. It's a good name.
[Keeley] Mm-hmm.
To Earl.
To Earl.
To Earl.
Mmm.
Okay, I should go.
I promised the boys we'd watch Empire Strikes Back tonight, and I have to get my thoughts together for when they ask about Luke and Leia making out.
Oh, right.
[sighs, sucks teeth] Wish me luck.
Good luck, Higgins.
Bye, Leslie.
Hey. May the force be with you.
And also with you.
All right.
[cell phone beeps] Oh, my God!
[gasps] Oh, is that him?
Yes, yes, yes. [squeals] Come on! Oh, good!
[squeals] [chuckles] [squeals] Okay.
Hey, him who?
[both] Shh.
And?
Well, I mean… Okay, but?
Oh, no. Totally.
Good, I'm proud of you.
[giggles] Thanks.
Am I allowed to speak yet?
Oh, sorry, Ted. It's just a little bit of girl talk about a gentleman suitor I've gone out with a few times.
[both giggling] Nice. A little girl talk. I get it.
What's his name-- [both] Shh.
Oh.
[sighs] Are you guys up for a double date next week? Let him prove his mettle.
Abso-fucking-lutely.
Can you ask Roy if he's free?
He's free. Don't worry.
Okay, cool.
H-Hey, did Roy come to the game today?
Oh, no, he didn't. Sorry, Ted.
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm sure he'll swing by at some point, right?
Hey, he knows he's always got a ticket waiting for him at will call, yeah?
Yeah.
Good, okay.
And don't forget, I don't put it under his name.
I don't want folks messing with him. It's under an alias.
Like, last week it was, um, uh, Loretta Lynn, this week was Dolly Parton, and next week is, if I remember correctly, Shania Twain.
[chuckles] Just brilliant.
And it's nothing personal.
It's just that he's been so busy with this new coaching gig.
Oi! You listen to me!
You play like that next week, you can kiss the trophy goodbye, 'cause today, you all played like a bunch of little pricks!
You hear me?
[all] Yes, Coach!
Except for Kokoruda. Way to put your body on the line out there.
You know it, Coach.
All right, Monika's mum brought orange slices.
Don't eat the peels, you animals. Off you go.
Keeley!
Hey, Phoebs!
Coach Kent. They're eight years old.
You can't call them little pricks.
Sorry, Ms. Bowen.
Even when they're being little pricks.
See you on Monday at school, girls.
Bye, Ms. Bowen.
Hey, babe.
[girl] Bye, Ms. Bowen.
[kisses] All right, who wants some hot chocolate?
[gasps] Me!
I do.
Yeah, let's go! [chuckles] Oh.
Oh! Before I forget, Rebecca wanted to see if we could do some double date action next week.
Fucking hell.
Bad word, Uncle Roy. You owe me one quid.
Put it on my tab.
Can you hold this, please?
Course.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Fine.
Thank you.
Mmm.
[chuckles] Phoebe, how was the match today?
Outstanding.
Yeah?
I got a red card for elbowing a girl in her neck.
And I'm very proud.
What?
[chuckles] Well, I know that you guys are just gonna smash it next week.
Me too.
So once the season's over, you're gonna have more time to see some friends, right?
I see friends all the time.
I know. You got your yoga mums.
Don't you ever want anything more than sitting in child's pose, getting buzzed on rosé, and gossiping about reality TV with a bunch of women that know nothing about you?
No, I love it.
Mmm.
Sky Sports reached out again.
No.
I think it's a good idea.
Last time I did one of your good ideas, I made a fucking fool of myself.
Your retirement press conference was beautiful, Roy. People loved it.
It got, like, 15 million views.
Wait, so your way of alleviating my embarrassment is to tell me how many millions of people have seen me look like a knob?
[chuckles] Good point.
I just wanna go on record saying that I think you'd be an amazing pundit.
I don't wanna be a fucking football pundit, sat on fucking telly in a dumb fucking suit like a know-it-all twat.
It's a shit job for shit people.
I'd rather shit out my own fucking mouth than do that fucking shit.
Got it.
Oi, Phoebs, where we at now?
£1,236.
Impressive.
[Arlo] And it's déjà vu all over again as Dani Rojas has another injury-time penalty kick to put Richmond in the win column for the first time this season.
If he can get it past this adorable goalkeeper.
[dog panting] Oh, gamesmanship from the keeper. How will Rojas respond?
[dog grunting] Hmm?
[dog squeals] [gasps] [panting] Football is death!
[knocks] Oh, come in.
Morning, boss.
Oh, hi, Ted.
Yikes. I haven't seen someone that disappointed to see me since I wore a red baseball cap to a Planned Parenthood fundraiser.
Sorry, Ted. You're right. I-- I was just hoping you were Keeley.
That's okay. I wish I was Keeley three, four times a day.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Let me guess. You got a fever for the flavor of a little girl talk?
Well, shoot, why don't you let me take a crack at it?
Really?
Yeah, why not?
Oh. Okay, what the hell.
Uh, so this, um, chap I've been seeing, John.
Stamos?
No, his name's John Wingsnight.
Okay.
But that's not the point.
Mm-hmm. Now hold on a second. His name's John Wingsnight?
Yes.
Like at a sports bar?
Like, "Monday night's wings night down at PJ Flatts," like that?
Ted, would you please stop?
Rule number one: Even though it's called "girl talk," sometimes it needs to be more like, "Girl, listen." Got it. Learning on the fly here. Come on. Hit me.
All right, thank you. So, John, um, I mean-- I mean, he's a wonderful man.
He's very handsome, um, successful.
Ooh. Nice.
Not shy.
Mmm, is he nice to you?
Uh, yes. Yes, very.
Good. Yeah, he sounds great.
Mmm.
So I'm confused. Is there a problem here?
Well… Actually, I suppose not.
Okay.
Okay, so rule number two is sometimes girl talk can just be blabbing away about stuff, and nothing has to really change, and no one has to solve anything?
Yeah, that's exactly right.
I love it. Let's keep going.
Right, so… [clears throat] Come.
Ooh.
Okay.
Mmm.
Hey, sorry I'm late, fellas.
I was helping the boss pick out a nail polish color for her date tonight.
My favorite's the blue, but I think they all kinda rock.
What do guys you think?
What's wrong?
We got a situation, Coach.
He's underselling. We have a Shakespearean fucking tragedy.
[players] Take it easy, Dani.
Come on, Dani. One more time, yeah? Have another go.
[players cheering] [Isaac] Come on, Dani. Come on.
[breathing heavily] [Dani grunts] [players] Oh!
[car alarm] [speaking Spanish] [car alarm chirps] How many has he missed?
All of them.
Oh, boy. Okay. Hey, Dani!
Come on, son. Let's take a walk.
Wow. We're watching the end of someone's career.
Not now, Jan.
[panting] Uh, s-sorry, Coach.
No, no need to apologize.
Dani, what happened between you and Earl, that wasn't your fault, you know.
You suffered an unlikely and tragic coincidence.
Not too dissimilar from those seen throughout Paul Thomas Anderson's 1999 opus, Magnolia.
Is that Tom Cruise with a little, tiny ponytail?
No, Dani. I think you're thinking about The Last Samurai.
He's got a little, tiny ponytail in Magnolia too, Coach.
Oh, thank you, Coach.
My apologies, Dani.
Tom Cruise was rocking a little, tiny ponytail in both those films.
Okay.
Point is, it's a tragic occurrence, all right?
A one-time thing.
So let's get away from the bad mojo coming off that penalty box and, you know, have some fun.
Let's kick some corners, right?
Right. [sniffs] Yeah?
Hey, fellas! Line up for Midnight Poutine!
[players cheer] Yeah, there we go.
Help you get your feel back.
[straining] All right, Dani.
Okay, Coach.
Take a deep breath, yeah?
I want you to picture the shot.
Be the ball, Dani. Now kick it.
Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[players chuckle] Ooh! [laughs] Oh, boy.
That's all right. That's all right.
[sighs] Well, fellas, I am more stumped than Paul Bunyan's local forest, you know th-- Ow! Ooh, that hurt. Ay, ay, ay. [sucks teeth] Any ideas?
If Dani needs motivation, we could always just show him his goddamn paycheck.
I mean, that's a tad aggressive, you know.
But hey, I shouldn't bring an umbrella to a brainstorm, so I appreciate you getting the ball rolling, Nate.
Yeah.
Seems like the first thing we need to do is define the issue, yeah?
True that.
I think we already know what it is, don't we, Coach?
What you talking about, Willis?
Hey, you're not supposed to say that out loud.
Which is why I wrote it down.
"The yips"?
Shh!
What are the yips?
Shh!
Are you kidding me, you two?
We don't say the Y-word out loud, you understand?
It's like saying Macbeth in a theater, or Voldemort at Hogwarts, or, uh… Soccer in England.
Bingo.
But what are [mouthing] the yips?
It's when, just out of nowhere, an athlete suddenly can't do the basic fundamentals of their sport.
Yeah, you know, like Chuck Knoblauch's throw to first, or, uh, Charles Barkley's golf swing.
You guys know what I mean.
Yeesh, sometimes being here is like living in a foreign country.
You ever feel that way?
Yeah.
Ted, what are your thoughts on therapy?
Uh, general apprehension and a modest Midwestern skepticism. Why do you ask?
Well, maybe we should bring in a sports psychologist.
I know a lot of other clubs have had tremendous success with that.
Hmm.
It's not a bad idea, Coach.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm. Okay. [inhales deeply] Yeah, um, hold on.
Let me think here. Let me get my thinking thing on, okay.
Yeah, let's do it.
[ambient jazz music playing] And now, we're nose-to-nose with one another, and half of me is thinking, "Just kick this jerk in the balls… [chuckles] …and when he bends over, give him a knee to the nose and be done with it, 'cause screw this guy." And the other half of me is thinking, "But it's Martin Short.
You love Martin Short." Mmm.
Well, the next thing you know, this tiny American woman says, "Is that it?" [laughs] And sure enough, there it was, wedged between the couch cushions, Martin Short's wallet. [laughs] Martin Short's wallet.
I mean, he didn't steal it.
[laughing] No!
Wow, that's insane. [chuckles] That's madness. Could I get another one, please?
God, I never knew that meet and greets at Broadway shows could be such hotbeds for, like, almost violence.
Oh, big-time. But who cares about Martin Short when you're sitting next to "He's here, he's there, he's every-fucking-where, Roy Kent," Roy Kent!
John's football-mad.
Oh, terrific. Who do you support?
Well, I bounce back and forward between United and City.
Whichever club's winning, typically.
I love it.
Sounds like it.
So, how's retirement, Roy?
I mean, I can't imagine how different your life must be now.
You must miss it all like mad, yeah?
I don't.
Hmm.
So what are you doing now then?
Oh, you know, busy, busy.
Ah.
I'm actually doing a bit of coaching at the moment.
I hadn't heard that. Fantastic.
Yeah. We got a cup final next week.
In October… W-What cup's that?
West London under-nine girls.
Can I get another one, please?
He's actually had an offer from Sky Sports to be a pundit.
Oh, of course you have. You'd be amazing at that job.
I love that idea.
I couldn't agree more.
Can I just say that your retirement speech was amazing.
It's the first time my father's forwarded me an e-mail in the last five years that wasn't about the scourge of immigration.
And that really meant a lot to me, so thank you.
Cheers.
It must've been super weird afterwards though, right?
I'm gonna need two more of these, please.
[Mae] Here you go, gentlemen.
Thank you, Mae.
Thanks, Mae.
Shame what happened to Earl.
Mm-hmm.
Him and his owner, Nigel, used to come in here all the time, till he started shitting and pissing all over the place.
Yeah. Nah, that's pretty common with older dogs.
No, I'm talking about Nigel.
Hmm.
To Earl.
He was a good boy.
Mmm.
Hey, Coach, can I get real a second? Forget my meal a second?
Put down your beer and tell your buddy how you feel a second?
Yeah.
Sure.
Look, I'm all for whatever it takes to help Dani get back to being a hundred.
But, um, this whole idea of bringing in someone from the outside to help us get him there, I don't know, it just kinda puts a little knot in my belly.
I'm not sure why.
Hmm. Sounds like it might be your favorite Gin Blossoms song.
"Follow You Down"?
No, "Hey Jealousy." No, "Hey Jealousy" is their best song.
My favorite song of theirs is "Follow You Down." You don't know that story?
Uh… Doesn't matter, but to your point, you know, I thought it might've been that green-eyed monster too, but, uh, you know, I think there's a part of me that just doesn't, uh-- I don't know, uh, trust therapists?
And how come?
Well, when Michelle and I did couple's therapy, it was with this therapist she'd been going to for a while, and, um… I just kinda felt like I was being set up, you know.
Like I was going in there not to be listened to, but rather just to hear about all the things I'd been doing wrong.
And that's the only time you've ever seen a therapist?
Oh, yeah. [chuckles] Do you remember what you said when I got dumped by that cruise ship dancer and swore I would never date another dancer again?
"Can I have your tap shoes?" "All people are different people." Hmm. I said that?
Mm-hmm.
Oh. That's pretty good.
Yeah.
You went out with another dancer though?
Many.
Too many.
Sorry if I was prattling on too much this evening.
[sighs] You were as charming as ever.
You sure you don't wanna come back to mine?
Got an early morning, remember?
Right. Yeah, um, well, let me know if I passed the test.
Lunch later this week?
Perfect.
Night.
Ooh. [chuckles] Thank you.
[giggles] See ya.
Bye. [chuckles] Cheers.
Well?
I think he's a really good match.
I mean, he's age-appropriate, financially appropriate.
He's not shy.
I love that about him.
Totally.
Fucking hell.
Is there a problem?
Tell the truth.
He's fine. That's it.
Nothing wrong with that, most people are fine.
But it's not about him. It's about why the fuck you think he deserves you.
You deserve someone who makes you feel like you've been struck by lightning.
Don't you dare settle for fine.
Hmm.
Not that it's any of my business.
435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440-- Ha!
Higgins, look alive!
Ooh! Ah.
Aw. [clicks tongue] Nuts.
Mm-mmm.
Sorry. Um, I just wanted to introduce you to Dr. Sharon Fieldstone.
She's gonna be looking after Dani.
This is Nathan, Coach Beard, and Ted Lasso.
[grunts] Oh, you don't need to stand.
But it makes it a lot easier to do this.
[beatboxes] ♪ It's nice to meet you ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ It's nice to meet you ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Consider this song Our way to greet you ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ So I understand that Dani has developed a case of the yips?
Hey!
[squeals] Okay, that's two weird things in a row. What's going on?
Well, Doc, we don't like using that word around here.
Why?
Um, how do I… Why y'all looking at me?
He's the one that knows everyth-- Oh, okay, all right. Um, well, Doc-- Doctor.
Right, yes, of course. Sorry.
Um, Doctor. Um, it's a superstition.
I see. Well, the yips… [squeals] [groans] …are not a superstition.
They are a mental condition, one that can be fixed with discipline, not denial.
So, then, you're pretty confident that you can help us out with Dani, huh?
Are you good at your job?
Uh, I mean… Don't worry about them.
Put all bullshit humility aside and be honest with me.
Are you good at your job? Yes or no?
Um, yes.
I believe you.
Well, as good as you are at your job, I'm twice as good at mine.
We're very lucky to have you.
Thank you very much.
That's good to know.
Thank you for coming here.
Right, so where should I be conducting my sessions?
Um… [Higgins stammers] Why don't I set you up in my office, all right?
Great. Nice meeting all of you and sorry to have interrupted your game.
What's your record?
Oh, uh, 1,236.
Impressive.
She seems fun.
Mm-hmm.
You're sure you're okay, me using your office?
Not just being polite?
I-- It's probably a bit of both, but I insist.
[chuckles] Thank you, Mr. Higgins.
No problem.
[knocks] Hey, Doc, uh, tor.
Uh, this right here, this is Dani Rojas.
Dani, this is Dr. Sharon Fieldstone.
Nice to meet you, Dani. How you feeling?
Like a murderer.
Please.
You're all right.
Yeah. Want me to stick around, help you break the ice with Dani here?
I think we'll be all right, Coach Lasso. Thank you.
Okay. Yeah.
[Dr. Fieldstone speaking Spanish] [Dani speaking Spanish] You okay?
Oh, yeah.
This is gonna be perfect. Yeah.
Aw.
And remember, this is when tickets to Stomp were tough to get.
Anyway, this tall redhead pushes in front of me, so I tap him on the shoulder, he turns around and goes, "Is there a problem?" I go, "Yeah, there's a problem." He goes, "It's all right. It's all right. I know the choreographer." [fading] Guess who it was… [muffled speaking] [muffled speaking continues] [normal] Is everything okay, Rebecca?
[stammers] It's j-- Dating is so odd, isn't it?
Yeah.
I mean, we are all strangers essentially.
So I mean, how is it ever possible to truly feel safe with someone?
I suppose you can't.
You know, my friend, Flo, once told me that intimacy was all about leaving yourself open to being attacked.
Oh.
Isn't that horrible?
I've not heard that one.
But I mean, it does make you realize how scary it is, allowing yourself to be intimate again.
I mean, you really do have to be brave.
And that's it right there, isn't it?
I need to be brave enough to let someone… wonderful love me, without fear of being hurt and without fear of being… safe.
Sorry… Are you breaking up with me?
I'm so sorry. I-- I actually didn't know I was going to do that-- No, no, it's-- it's all right.
[laughs nervously] [sighs] Coffees are on me.
Yeah, fair enough. Cheers.
[John swallows] [Dani] Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
Dani Rojas, Rojas. Dani Rojas.
Hello, my beautiful coaches. May I join the drill?
Sure thing, Dani, yeah.
But hey, y-you take this at your own pace, okay?
You got it, Coach.
Hmm.
[groans] Did she not wave back?
Oh, I don't think she saw me.
She saw you.
[exhales] [players cheering] [chuckles] Oh!
Ohh!
Hey, all right!
Hey, they got a whole bunch of new emojis on here. You see this?
Do you remember when they added Groucho but no Harpo?
Mmm.
It's bullshit.
Good night, coaches, and thank you for Dr. Sharon. She's incredible.
No problem, Dani. Just glad you're feeling better.
[stammers] Yeah, but ho-hold on a sec. Um, I'm just curious.
What did she-- Um, I mean, what ended up helping you?
Dr. Sharon helped me remember that even though football is life, football is also death.
And that football is football too.
But mostly that football is life!
[chuckles] Yeah.
Yeah, well, there you have it.
You know what, I'm gonna go upstairs, thank the good doc before she splits.
It's the least you can do.
Hey, Higgins. Doc still here?
Oh, wait, Ted. She's in a session.
A session? With who?
Thank you, Sharon. For real.
Mm-hmm. You're welcome.
She's amazing.
Thierry?
Oh, yes. Hi.
[speaking French] [both speaking French] A few of the boys asked to sit down with Dr. Fieldstone before she left.
I don't see the harm, right?
No, that-- That's great. Yeah.
Hi.
[Roy] Hey, gorgeous. What's going on?
I feel like a little shit.
I used our fun night out together to try and change your mind about something you don't wanna do.
That was tacky, and I'm really sorry for it.
You're very sweet. Thank you.
[chuckles] I'm leaving work right now.
I can stop by Waitrose, pick up a bottle of wine, bring it over?
Waitrose, is it? Who am I talking to, the fucking queen?
[Keeley chuckles] I'd love to, but, um… Oh, fuck! Yeah, it's yoga mums night. Sorry.
Yeah, but you can beg for forgiveness later.
I can swing by and wake you up.
Oi, Roy. Hurry up. It's about to start.
I'll be awake. Have fun, yeah?
Bye, babe.
[music playing on TV] Let's fucking do this.
[music continues] [female host on TV] Who will be eliminated this week on the UK's number one show, Lust Conquers All?
Will it be Grimsby's top makeup counter associate, Ellie?
Can't vote me off, yeah? I'm the one who makes your lips tick.
Oh, shut up, you slag.
[laughing] Come on. She's hilarious.
Or will it be the footballing tart, Jamie?
[people on TV clamoring] You can't get rid of me. I'm the island's top scorer.
Sexually.
[scoffs] God, I love him.
[yoga mums sigh] Oh, same.
Jesus.
Top up my rosé please, Janice?
[female host on TV] …pharmacist from Borehamwood?
Or Clara, Bournemouth's scandalous… Cheers.
Cheers.
 @@@@@@
[electronic music plays] The audience at home has voted.
Danthony, Jamie. One of you will go home tonight.
The other will continue his lustful journey.
Better call your nan, mate. Tell her to put the kettle on.
Jamie.
The lust stops here.
[contestants gasp] I'm sorry.
Oh! Whoo-hoo! Yes!
What?
[cries] [Danthony] Thank you. Oy, thank you!
Wow.
It's bull[bleep].
[Danthony] Thank you!
Oh, wow, wow.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That is an absolute shocker.
Unlucky, really.
Yeah, but we are lucky to have with us, here in the studio, loser, Jamie.
Uh, easy, Phillip. I'm not just a loser, I'm the loser.
Well, Jamie, look, first things first, will you keep your promise to Amy?
Are you gonna wait for her?
Nah, no.
I was just playing a game, do you know what I mean?
Find the fittest girl there, have sex with her in the toilet, ask her to marry ya. Strategy.
Well, speaking of strategy, you decided to leave your club, Man City, uh, right at the start of their season. So why?
Just something I had to do, do you know what I mean?
The second that I found out that George Harrison had died, I realized that I had to stop waiting for life to begin.
Start taking chances. Living life to the fullest.
But George Harrison died 20 years ago.
Yeah, but I only just found out.
So what's next for Jamie Tartt?
Don't know. Back to, uh, Man City. If Pep will have me, that is.
It's funny you mention that 'cause we've got a clip.
You might find this quite interesting.
Any thoughts on Jamie Tartt and his future with Manchester City?
Ah, yes, Jamie.
You know, my wife and I thought he and Amy were meant for each other.
But no, he won't be coming back to Man City.
We wish him luck.
[reporters clamoring] Oh.
Well, thanks for stopping by, Jamie. Good to see you, as always.
When we come back, have scientists really discovered low-fat custard that doesn't make you sad?
Sounds too good to be true.
[man] Hey! Jamie! Jamie!
[fans clamoring] Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah.
[camera shutter clicking] [both] Thank you so much… Yeah. All right, yeah.
How's it going, yeah?
You all right, bro?
Yeah.
Sorry you got sacked, man.
Ah, it's how the crisp crumbles.
[speaks indistinctly] Thanks, man. Thanks, bruv. There. Nah, you good, man. Yeah, yeah.
Hello, mate. How you doing?
What's your name?
Stanley.
Stanley. And you like football, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Jamie.
All right. No worries, man. Yeah.
All right, see ya later. Nice to meet ya.
Um, I actually think I'm gonna walk, mate. Yeah? Nice one.
[theme music plays] Hold on. You slept here last night?
Why?
Jane and I got in a fight last night, and she threw my keys in the river.
Hey, you two are like Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner, you know?
Or, uh, Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow. Or Frank and-- Actually, you know what?
I'm starting to realize that Ol' Blue Eyes might've skewed mercurial.
Hmm. Hey, what time is it?
9:20.
Ooh. Right. I'll be back.
No, no, no. Smell this.
[sniffs] A Parisian bedroom.
Will, a word.
Yeah, come in.
You all right?
No, I'm not all right.
Did you put lavender-scented fabric softener in the laundry?
Yes. Yes, I did.
My girlfriend loves lavender. She finds it very calming.
Don't make changes that could throw off a player's headspace.
Sorry, Coach.
Go. Get out.
We don't want calm athletes. We want killer athletes.
Even after they shower?
Did you sleep here?
"Perchance to dream here." Thanks for the ride, babe. Do you wanna pop in? Say hi?
No.
Okay.
What you got planned today?
Nothing till the match later.
I'm going to get the girls to run a 4-4-2 diamond formation 'cause that little Kokoruda girl is a fucking beast in defense.
Then I was going to cook you cordon bleu for dinner.
Nigella says if you butterfly the chicken, it'll be more moist.
I don't know what does it for me more, you mentioning Nigella or using the word "moist." [Ted] Whoo-hoo!
[laughs] Yeah!
Yeah, all right. This is good.
What is Ted doing?
He's probably homesick. Closest thing he can find to a Dodge Ram.
[Ted groans] I appreciate you.
Good luck with the match, yeah?
Morning, Ted!
Hi, Keeley! Uh-oh, is that big, bad Roy Kent in there?
[tires screeching] Sorry. He's in a big rush.
Oh, that's okay. Hey, you know, "mime is money," right?
[chuckles] That looked like fun.
Oh, yeah. No, that's a blast.
And it's good for my sciatica too. The vibrations really help out my butt.
Wow.
[Ted] Hey, look who's here.
Hey.
Huh, that's a cool bike.
Whoa.
[Keeley gasps] That's not a bike, that's a transformer.
[Ted] Yeah, she really is more than meets the eye, ain't she.
Hey, Doc …tor Sharon!
Good morning.
What's she doing back here, I wonder? Don't we have direct deposit?
I thought Higgins hired her for the rest of the season, didn't he?
Hey, Higgins. Did you hire Dr. Sharon without running it by me first?
Yes. I thought it couldn't hurt.
But I should've asked you first, Ted. You're absolutely right.
No, I'm dead wrong.
I mean, heck, you're Director of Football Operations.
You gotta be able to make your own decisions.
Still, you should've texted me first.
That's 100% true.
No, 1,000% false!
I mean, you're a busy man!
Whatever path you think is best is gonna be best!
Still, next time you have plans, I want you to run 'em by me first. Okay?
No, I will not.
Good! Why should you? I ain't your daddy.
Okay, great. We got ourselves a new member of the team.
That's fine. I ain't got no-- [sniffs] Why's it smell like my nana's house in here?
[Nathan] Oh, Ted.
Wait until you hear this shit.
Ooh, do tell, Ricky Bell.
No one wants you.
What you mean no one wants me? I'm Jamie fucking Tartt.
You're too much of a liability.
You act like an asshole and disappear on Man City.
Then you act like an asshole and cheat on Amy with Denise by having Jacuzzi sex.
[sighs] No one wants you.
What about a team in Spain or Germany?
Hello, Real Madrid? Do you want Jamie Tartt?
No. Okay, thank you. See?
You weren't even speaking Spanish.
Maybe it's time for you to focus on your television career.
This is Tracey, your new talent agent.
You have an amazing offer for a new reality show in Ibiza.
How do you feel about taking ecstasy every night for three straight weeks?
You gotta help me, man.
Jamie, you know you're like a son to me.
Now you're like a dead son, which means I love you even more.
There's nothing I can do.
Ted Lasso Welcome Wagon has arrived.
Please don't barge in here like that. I could have been in a session.
Oh, right. Of course, I'm-- I'm sorry.
Can I help you with something?
Well, yeah. No, I-- I brought you a little somethin' somethin' for your first day at work.
No, thank you.
Oh, come on, now.
Just try a little bite, huh?
There you go. [chuckles] That's very thoughtful, Coach Lasso. But I don't eat sugar.
Really? Wow. I've never met someone who doesn't eat sugar.
Only heard about 'em, and they all live in this godless place called Santa Monica.
Trust me, it's in everyone's best interest.
In a past life, I would inhale a Cadbury's Flake, talk nonsense for an hour until I passed out.
I'm the same way with video games.
How so?
You know, it's just something in my life that I really enjoy.
But then I pretend that preventing myself from having 'em is somehow making my life better.
But in reality, all I'm doing is depriving myself of something that makes me happy, instead of attempting to adjust my relationship to it.
Hey, what's your favorite book?
This is interesting.
What is? That my answer's The Fountainhead?
I know, curveball, right? I can explain-- No, what you're doing here.
This is obviously your way of connecting with new people.
Makes sense. It's very disarming.
If it's okay with you, Coach Lasso, I'd like to observe training today.
See how everything's functioning.
Yeah, no, of course.
Yeah, you got a backstage pass. Full access. [chuckles] Thank you.
Okay.
Oh, hey, you know what I-- And I will let you know what the people from Dubai Air say.
Mmm.
All right, you got any questions for me?
Is it tacky to say I'm rich on an online dating profile?
Only if you put the word "filthy" in front of it.
Mmm.
[Keeley chuckles] [grunts] [items clatter] Sorry, sorry.
Higgins, it's very kind that you gave your office to Sharon.
Yes, it's very club-first mentality, Leslie, but you really should have an office, preferably your own.
No, you're absolutely right.
It's just very hard to kick an employee out of their workplace home.
Oh, it's only temporary.
What about, um-- Caroline in ad sales?
No, she's going through a breakup.
Plus, she's right next door to Laughing Liam.
Lovely man, but… [mocks laughter] [both mocking laughter] [Rebecca chuckling] Hey, Higgins. Oh, who's your new friend here?
Oh, hi, Robert. My name's Ted. Yep.
Hey, my name's Jimmy.
Jimmy Paper?
Page! Oh, I goofed that. I'm sorry, that was a great one. Dang it.
Hey, boss.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
What's this?
I tried to give your biscuits to Dr. Sharon.
You did what?
Evidently she doesn't eat sugar.
What a fucking asshole.
Yeah.
You ever been to a therapist, Rebecca?
What for? I can diagnose myself in a heartbeat.
I thought being invulnerable would protect me, so I pushed people away for years, leading me directly to my greatest fear: Being alone. Big whoop.
Big whoop, yeah. I don't get it.
Why pay someone to do what a friend should do for you for free?
Exactly. I mean, that's why you have friends, isn't it?
To burden them with your issues and anxieties, right?
Right. Yeah.
Yeah. Speaking of, you got anything you wanna get off your chest?
No. You?
No.
See, there you have it.
Exactly. Yeah, okay.
See you later, boss.
[sighs] There you go, Keeley.
Thanks, Alex.
Jamie?
I'm-- I'm not stalking ya.
I've been following you for a few blocks now, and I couldn't text you 'cause I deleted your number.
So, I was in town, and I wanted to talk to you 'cause I left Man City to do this reality TV show thing, and I got kicked off of both. So now I don't know what I'm doing, but I just wanted to talk to someone about it 'cause-- And whenever I think of talking, I think of you… So I've been following you for the last few blocks.
No, I'm lying.
I've been following you for your whole lunch hour.
But I've just been trying to build up the courage to say hi.
So… hi.
Is that okay?
You deleted my number?
Yeah.
[children cheering] You all played a hell of a game.
But you lost.
I want you to remember this feeling.
Burn this moment into your brains.
Good.
Is it time for trophies, Uncle Roy?
Yeah, yeah.
Emily's mom bought everyone consolation trophies.
Must be nice to just burn cash.
"Best dressed"? That's stupid. You're all wearing the same thing.
You.
[gasps] Right, you know what?
Just get amongst it. Enjoy your trophies for winning nothing.
Coach Kent.
Look, when I was young, you got shouted at for losing.
Same. But then, tough love never bothered me.
As long as I knew the coach gave a shit.
[growls] Oy! It has been an honor coaching all of you.
I do hope you'll come back and play next year.
But only if you fucking mean it.
[all giggling] Well, we lost.
Would have been closer, but one of the goals got disallowed because apparently nine-year-olds aren't allowed to do headers yet.
Fucking brain development.
Keeley?
Oh. [inhales sharply, moans] [moans] [Keeley] Hmm.
[panting] What you doing there?
[gasps] Nothing.
Why'd you throw your phone?
I thought that you were an intruder, and I didn't want you to steal it.
So you threw it over there?
Yeah.
Were you having a wank?
Show me.
No, that's okay. [chuckles] Babe, come on. Don't be embarrassed. Whatever it is, it's fine.
I like watching couples have sex in the woods.
You do? Why?
'Cause I could never be that free.
Oh.
Come on, let me see.
I should know what gets you going.
Mmm.
I am announcing… [cries] [Roy sniffs, clears throat] …my retirement… [sobs] …from-- [Roy coughs, sniffs] The fuck?
This is your kink?
Me being pathetic?
You're not being pathetic. You're being passionate and vulnerable.
God, it's fucking hot, and you haven't been like that since you left football.
At my age with a fucked knee, I don't get to be a football player.
That's how it works.
Then why not just try the pundit gig?
Oh, my God.
I know it's fucking stupid.
But you'd be back around the game again.
You miss it, Roy. I know you do.
You're just like Jamie.
I didn't think this conversation could get any worse.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, I saw him today.
He wants to come back and play for Richmond.
He's so lost, Roy. Just like you.
But at least he's tryin' to find his way back.
See? Pathetic.
No, it's not pathetic.
It's brave.
Oy, I get it.
Can't get hurt if you don't try.
But if you don't try, then I'm just gonna have to sit here wanking to videos of you crying.
Fine. I will try it once.
But when it sucks and I hate it, I'm gonna hire a bunch of children to follow you around and scream, "Told you so, told you so" for centuries.
I look forward to the attention.
What'd you tell the prince prick of all pricks about going back to Richmond?
I told him he was talking to the wrong person.
[door opens] [bell rings] [door closes] I named him Ted.
After Ted Danson.
All-time great.
You know, from Cheers to Curb to The Good Place. What a career.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I mean, he's basically the male version of Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
Who's like the female version of Dave Grohl.
Mm-hmm, yeah. All three of them got that Midas touch, don't they?
Mmm.
Nice to see ya, Jamie.
Take a seat.
How ya been?
Uh, awesome.
Yeah?
The best.
Pretty good.
Okay, a little depressed. Yeah.
It's all shit, Ted.
Mmm.
That's a real roller coaster there.
Glad I was tall enough to join you on that ride.
Anything I can help you with?
Uh, so I was talking to Keeley, and I was just wondering, like, what the chances were of me coming back to play for you at Richmond?
I don't know, Jamie, you burned a lot of bridges over there.
Look, Coach, I need Richmond.
And Richmond needs you.
Thank you, Mae.
Cheers.
Uh, actually, Mae, um, would you be a darling and ask those lads at the end of the bar to stop staring at me, please?
Oy, you three, fuck off.
Oh, yeah, course, Mae.
Sorry!
Fucking off now.
Wow. Old people are so wise.
Mmm.
They're like tall Yodas.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Jamie, let me ask you something. Why'd you do that reality show?
You know, you were getting good minutes up at City.
I don't know, just thought it'd be fun. Help boost me brand.
Mm-hmm.
[sighs] Did it to piss off me dad.
Mmm.
He was just on me after every match.
How I played, how many minutes I played, how I sat on the bench when I didn't play.
Mmm.
Just drove me fucking mad.
He can be a bit… Yeah.
You know, I've noticed that sometimes having a tough dad is exactly what drives certain fellas to become great at what they do.
You know, I hear Bono's father was a real piece of work.
But then again, so was Joshua Tree, so you know… What about you?
Hmm?
Was your old man like that?
No.
No, my father was a lot harder on himself than he ever was on me.
You're lucky.
Hmm.
So what do you say then, Coach?
Jamie, you're an amazing player.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
Yeah.
[camera shutter clicks] Right, now get one where it looks like they're sitting in my hand.
[shutter clicking rapidly] [all chuckling] That's some bullshit.
Bloody hell.
Wait, that was last night?
What are you all fussing over?
Looks like Jamie's coming back to Richmond.
It looks like they're sitting on his hand.
[shouting] [player] Get fucking stuck in!
Just throw it here!
Somebody order training extra spicy today?
Yeah, it's got that Nando's peri-peri sauce on it, huh?
[shouting continues] [player 3] What the fuck was that?
[player] What the fuck you waiting for?
How come every time I look back there it's like she's getting closer and closer?
Thank you, Will.
That's all right.
[Will hums] Optical illusion induced by your mistrust of her profession?
Metaphor, huh?
Bingo, Ringo.
Ooh.
Is there pi-- Is there pineapple in this?
Jesus Christ.
Mmm.
I'm with Ted. We've been overrun by incompetent outsiders.
I don't think I said that, did I?
Mmm. Not to me. It was him.
Yeah.
Come on now. She's definitely getting closer.
[all yelling] Yes!
[Sam] Yeah, do it!
Oh, now, look at that. Hey, Nate.
Hit me two times, will ya?
Yeah.
Hey, Sam! Hold up! Hey!
Look, baby, when you make that pass, you gotta put some grass under it.
Make Dani chase it down like it's a loose toddler in a busy parking lot.
You think you can do better? Come here and do it then.
Oy! Easy, bruv.
No, no, no. That's okay. Sam's right.
There ain't nothing going on out here on this field that I can do better than any of y'all.
Unless you break into a game of "finish that Jimmy Buffett lyric." Then I'll be changing your latitudes and attitudes left, right and center.
You-- Hey, Sam.
I'm just tryin' to help the team here.
Bullshit.
[players] Oh. Ooh. Ayayay.
[player] Whoa.
Okay.
I-- Um, I'm gonna see what that's all about here real quick.
He's not normally like this, you know, so… I guess Sam doesn't like Jimmy Buffett.
Who's Jimmy Buffett?
Really?
Hey. Sam! Slow down. Hey, you got something you wanna talk about?
No.
Really? It seems like you got something on your mind.
Something like, "I'm angry about a mysterious thing so I'm gonna do some cussing now." I mean, I am angry.
Oh-- And I did cuss, and every time I do, I regret it.
'Cause people say cuss words when they don't know the right ones to use to express themselves.
Except Bernie Mac.
He uses them like van Gogh uses yellow. You know, effectively.
Come on, talk to me.
I can't believe you're bringing Jamie back to the team.
What?
I saw the picture of you and him on Twitter.
Oh, Sam, there's a bunch of crazy stuff on Twitter.
Heck, someone made an account for my mustache.
How many locker room punch-ups have we had since Jamie's been gone?
None.
None.
[stammers] Have we won yet? No, but we will.
I believe that. Don't you?
Just because Jamie can score goals doesn't mean he deserves to be here.
[sighs] [sighs] No teammate has ever made me feel as bad about myself as Jamie did.
Sam, I understand your anger towards him.
It's not him.
I'm mad at you.
You didn't even talk to us about it.
Honestly, Sam, I didn't think there was anything to talk about.
I told Jamie it wasn't gonna happen.
Oh.
Oh, now I feel awkward.
I bet.
[groans] Did everybody see me when I stomped off the pitch and-- No, no one saw that. Yeah, man! Everyone saw that. Come on.
Of course they did.
Coach, I'm so sorry.
It's okay, Sam, all right?
You are a leader on this team. I want you to speak your mind.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, you know, my father says every time he sees you on TV, he's very happy that I am here.
That I'm in safe hands with you.
[chuckles] Well, that means a lot.
I appreciate that.
You know I still gotta make you run a bunch of laps, right?
I was hoping you would.
Okay. Get going.
Thank you.
Yes.
[Higgins] Very well handled, Ted.
Gee… Thank you, Higgins.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Sorry. What do you usually do with your lashes?
I leave them the fuck alone.
[phone: ringtone plays] 'Scuse me.
Hey.
[Keeley] Hi.
I wanted to see how it was going.
Jamie Carragher sent me flowers.
We fucking despised each other when we played, now he's sending me flowers.
How the fuck does he know I love white orchids?
Babe, it's only natural to be a bit nervous.
I'm not nervous. There's nothing scary about this.
There's no defense in TV.
Well, what is it then?
It's just-- [sighs] What if-- What if everyone thinks I'm shit?
Since when do you care what people think?
You're Roy fucking Kent.
[knocks] Ready for Mr. Kent.
I gotta go. Thank you.
Kill 'em. Roy-o!
[exhales sharply] Oh, glad to have you on the show, Roy.
Whatever.
[chuckling] Same old Roy Kent. [laughs] Hey, Roy, try not to get too emotional, yeah?
[guests laugh] And we're on in five seconds.
Four, three, two.
What a match! Manchester United beat Chelsea 1-nil in a result that drops Chelsea out of the European places and lands United in the top three, for now.
Chris, was this a case where United won the match or that Chelsea lost it?
United just had that extra sharpness in the final third, but I thought both teams played really well.
George?
A real even battle.
You know, it's football at its finest.
[host] Roy Kent, ex-Chelsea legend joins us.
Welcome, Roy.
[grunts] [inhales sharply] Right, what did you think?
Did your former club play well?
No. I thought they played like shit.
[guests laugh] Uh, our apologies to the viewing audience.
Roy Kent with some salty language.
Would you care to elaborate, Roy?
All right. Chelsea was shit today.
[chuckling] They were shocking.
Watching them, you'd never know they were playing at home.
They were too timid. They were too respectful of United.
They were lucky they didn't lose by three or four or ten.
That's harsh, Roy. United's been on a good run recently.
Who gives a shit, Chris?
[Roy] That's no excuse to play like you're afraid of 'em.
You could see it in their faces: abject terror.
Like children waiting in line for the handsy Father Christmas.
Have some fucking pride in your shirt or don't fucking wear it.
[viewers laughing] Roy Kent, you fucking legend!
I mean, that is how you do it!
I enjoy his candor.
Again, we apologize for almost every word Roy just said.
Higgins, as a founding member of the Diamond Dogs, it breaks our little bowwow hearts to see you wandering around this building.
A man without a desk.
So we'd like to ask you to move in with us down here with my man, Nate.
What do you say?
Oh, that would be perfect. I mean, only if it's okay with Nathan.
Of cour-- Of cour-- Yeah, of course.
Roomies!
Oh. Oops, sorry.
[Higgins mutters] Now, before y'all bounce, I do have one piece of football business we need to discuss.
And that is Jamie Tartt's future with this team.
I thought that was settled.
Well, I did too.
Then I was talking to Sam, and he unsettled it.
Sam wants Jamie back?
[Ted] No, no.
Sam just reminded me that he himself has got a great dad.
Not everyone has that.
And isn't the idea of "never give up" one of them things we always talk about in sports?
And shouldn't that apply to people too?
Two aces is very tempting. Could be exactly what we need.
Mmm.
But it could also ruin morale to have someone in here just belittling everyone all the ti-- Will! Will! Not beneath the lockers. On the bench, man. Come on.
Sorry.
What a doughnut.
What was I saying?
What about you, Coach?
Pro: He's a great player.
Con: He's a poop in the punch bowl.
All right, Diamond Dogs, as canines, we are supposed to lack opposable digits.
But right now I'm gonna ask you: thumbs up or thumbs down?
Mmm.
Hmm.
Okay. Okay.
Hi.
How'd it go?
Come on, babe. Say something.
What, you just gonna pretend like you hated it?
You were amazing.
Shit, you really did hate it.
May I have your phone?
Roy, I'm really sorry.
It's just that-- I mean, not that it matters-- But everyone over there, they loved you.
And Twitter was going cuckoo for Coco Pops.
But you don't ever have to do it again if you don't want to, so… Here.
Felt good to be back around the game.
Oh, good.
What are you doing?
You helped me to help myself. Again.
So I wanted to thank you properly.
Hit play.
[Roy] I am announcing… [cries] [clears throat] …my retirement… [sobs] …from-- [gasps, chuckles] [Keeley moans, giggles] Hey, there she is.
Good night, Coach Lasso.
And thank you for letting me observe training today.
Oh.
Some coaches get quite conspiratorial at the notion.
Well, I didn't know I had a choice. I'm just goofing.
Besides, most of my conspiracies revolve around the Freemasons on account of a couple different Disney cartoons I watched a bunch as a kid.
I'll email you and your staff my takeaways when I get home.
Well, hey. Come on. Let 'er rip right now.
Reading that email will be like listening to a cover tune of your thoughts.
Rather hear this tune for the first time from the original artist.
Well, if you insist.
I do.
There's a wonderful atmosphere here.
All the employees are thoughtful and kind, and they actually listen to one another.
Yeah, I've noticed the same thing.
Well, hey, let me ask you this now.
You think we got ourselves a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" situation here or what?
That depends.
Does everyone agree that being winless with eight straight draws "ain't broke"?
[chuckles] Yeah.
Heavy is the head that wears the visor, Coach Lasso.
You must have a lot on your mind.
I hope we get a chance to sit down and talk about it all someday.
Yeah. No, I look forward to that.
All right. Good night, Doc…tor! Doctor.
Sorry.
You can call me Doc. It's okay.
Oh, thank God. I mean, that's been killing me.
You saw it, you know. It's just such a good nickname.
Prince of Tides.
Is that your nickname for me now?
No, Coach Lasso. My favorite book.
Hmm.
[shouting] The people at Dubai Air have asked specifically for Sam.
Huh?
There's a photo shoot set up for Friday.
Good for him. That young man deserves some recognition.
[Keeley] Yeah.
[knocks] Hello. Sorry to interrupt. I'm Sharon Fieldstone.
Yes. Oh, it is lovely to meet you, Dr. Fieldstone.
Please, call me Sharon. Hi.
Hi! Lovely to meet you.
I just wanted to stop by and thank you for the lovely gift basket of bottled water.
Yes, well, Ted said you didn't eat sugar.
So many other things don't have sugar in them.
I really am glad that you're joining us.
I hope that you'll be just the boost we need to get things going around here.
Wouldn't you say, Higgins?
Leslie?
Sorry, I was just, um… Hmm.
 @@@@@@
["Hand in My Pocket" playing] [song continues through speakers] Hi, how you doing?
You new around here?
To planet Earth?
No, I'm 13.
But I'm also fairly certain this is my third life reincarnated.
[whistles] Well, color me impressed 'cause my third lap around this big blue marble I was nothing but a horsefly.
Oh, I've never seen a horse fly.
No?
Saw a horse pee once.
That was a lot.
Yeah. Noisy too.
[chuckles] To be honest, now that my lower back tattoo's completely gone, I kinda miss it.
Mmm.
[door opens] Here comes the biscuits train! Choo choo! [chuckles] Sassy Smurf!
Marlboro Man.
What?
[laughs] Hey! Hey!
All right! How about that? Yeah.
[giggles] Here you go, boss.
Thank you.
Uh, hey, who's the new receptionist?
Oh, that's Nora, my daughter.
Oh, okay. Wait… Is she mine?
Ted, we had sex like six months ago.
Right, right, right, right. Sorry. Yeah, bad math. [chuckles] And if memory serves, you finished on my-- Hey! [babbles] Yeah.
No reason to get into the science of it all in front of the boss here, you know.
So, uh… [clears throat] anyhoo… What's the hap, Sass? What brings your fun buns in town, huh?
I'm speaking at a conference in Brighton. So Nora is staying with Stinky here.
Yes, and I am going to make good on every single one of her wishes from the last six years.
Aw.
Hmm, just make sure one of those wishes is a spare tampon then, Miss Fairy Godmother.
Oh.
Mmm.
That girl is an errant cobblestone away from her first period.
Well, bibbidi-bobbidi-booyah. You know. [chuckles] Always good to see ya, Sass. [laughs] Straight shooter.
Okay, I'll let you ladies get back to it. All right? TTFN. Yeah?
Oh, hey, you know what?
What do you say we do what the man says and make today our masterpiece, yeah?
[clicks tongue] Okay.
Did he talk like that when-- The whole time and so eager to please.
Hmm.
It was fabulous.
Hmm. [grunts] [theme music plays] [male reporter 1] Ted!
[male reporter 2] Coach!
All right, Lloyd, why don't you go all Pat Benatar on me, yeah?
And hit you with my best shot?
Fire away.
Yes!
So, you've got Coventry City this weekend, where you're heavily favored.
You think this'll end your team's embarrassing streak of draws?
Oh, Lloyd, I've never been embarrassed about having streaks in my drawers.
It's all part of growing up. Yeah?
[reporters laughing] All right, who else?
Yes, sir.
Trent Crimm, The Independent.
Hi, Trent. Make like Dunst and Union and bring it on, baby.
Hmm.
Ted, you're known for creating a great environment in the locker room, but do you think the return of the prodigal son, Jamie Tartt, will impact that so-called "vibe"?
Hmm. Well, I don't think so, Trent.
Yeah. I believe that Jamie's on a path to becoming a better man and I'm just here to help him along that journey.
You know, think of me as his own personal Mr. Miyagi.
Except without all that extra yard work. Yeah.
[players chattering] [Keeley] Knock knock!
Hey!
Sam, I think I have something you might wanna see.
Okay?
You wanna look at your photos from the Dubai Air shoot?
Ooh! Yes, please.
Oh, God. I'm very nervous. But also very excited.
That's similar to whenever Colin drives me somewhere in his Lamborghini.
Aye, it's true. It's way too much car for me.
Look at you! I mean, come on.
Oh, wow!
You're a mood. You're a moment. You're a mantra.
Those sound like compliments. Thank you.
Bruh, I'm confused. Is this an ad for ugly people?
[laughter] Congratulations, amigo. I can't wait to see these up in a tube station.
[chuckles] Yeah, so I can draw a dick on his face.
[laughs] Ah, yeah!
Bro, why you wearing your kit on the plane?
[players laugh] 'Cause it's the only way they'll know he's a footballer.
[silence] [Thierry] Anyways, man. Um, what are we… The pictures are so great.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, I'm so proud of you!
Thanks.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
Oh, boys. Will you remember to sign up for that new dating app I emailed you all about?
It would really help draw some traction if there were some young, hot footballers on there.
Yeah, well… Keeley, Keeley, uh, what was the name again?
Bantr. B-A-N-T-R.
Ah, like Grindr.
Yeah.
Well, promise me you'll just check it out?
Of course.
You're the best! [kisses] [chattering] [Keeley] Bye!
Okay, fellas. Got a big game this weekend.
What are we looking at, Coach?
Very physical.
Okay. All right. Anything else?
Borderline violent.
[Ted] Mm-hmm. You heard the man.
Still can't believe y'all don't have pads in this sport. It's amazing.
Sorry, Coach. Um, do you mind if I say something, please?
[stammers] Yeah. No, sure, Jamie. Come on. Yeah.
Thanks.
I know I wasn't the greatest teammate.
I did some shitty things. I said some shitty things.
But I want each and every one of you to know that I'm truly sorry and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to make it up to ya. Yeah?
You called me a jaundiced worm.
Right, yeah. And I'm sorry about that, Colin.
In a profile for my hometown paper.
You hit on my mum.
In front of my dad.
[stammers] I apologize for that, Bumbercatch.
Uh, please tell your father I'm sorry.
Um, and give Janet me best, yeah?
[speaks French] [Ted] Uh… Oh, he said that you cupped a fart and put it in his face.
[players muttering] Sounds better in French.
Yeah. I know. I do-- I do remember that and I'm-- I'm sorry.
Um… Hey, is there anyone else?
You got us relegated, mate.
[clamoring] I don't know you, but I don't like you.
I am not a worm.
Okay. Okay, okay, fellas. All right. That's good.
Good apology. Way to get the ball rolling. Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go.
Let's get out on the pitch. Settle it out there.
Let's go, Richmond!
[Ted] Here we go now. Come on.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
[orchestral music playing] I remember the last time I brought you here we played that contest of who could fit the most little sandwiches in their mouth.
[chuckles] Yeah. That was a while ago.
[sips, swallows] [girl speaks indistinctly] [Rebecca] Oh, this is silly, isn't it?
[Nora] No, not at all.
Don't know what I was thinking. You're not six anymore, are you?
[sighs] It's fine. Really.
Should we go somewhere else though?
Yes.
I'll get the bill. [giggles] Then you're coming back, right?
Yes, why?
Ah, just making sure you're not gonna disappear for another six years.
I'm joking.
[sighs] Okay, I deserved that. [chuckles] [chattering] [assistant coach speaking Spanish] [whistle blows] All right, fellas, I think we've all had enough of this amuse-bouche.
Time to move on to the main course.
Chef Beard, what's on the menu?
11 v 11. Let's go!
[blows whistle] [cheers] Let's go! Let's go!
Hey, Jamie. Come here real quick.
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, keep them hips loose.
That's it. Take your time. Love it.
Boy, I wish I could move like that.
To be so young.
Yeah.
So, hey, we're gonna start you out on the reserve squad, all right?
No problem, Coach. Yeah.
Figure it would be good for the fellas to see ya earn your spot back.
[panting] Smart. Yeah.
Nothing more likable than watching somebody humbly overcome adversity with their effortless God-given talent. Pow.
Hey, just do me a favor. Don't try to do too much out there, all right?
I know what you mean, Coach.
Yeah.
Mr. Kit man! Hit me!
Hey, you think he heard me?
I do.
Think he gonna listen to me?
I do not.
Yeah.
They are going to kill him. [chuckles] Sorry. He just-- He just wasn't very nice to me either, so… [Ted grunts] [Nathan chuckles] Go, go!
[players yelling] [player 1] Jamie! Jamie!
[player yelling] [player 2] Jamie. Jamie! Jamie!
Yeah!
[grunts] Oof!
[player 3] Whoo!
Hey, while you were off filming your little TV show, some things changed around here.
Don't bring that weak rubbish my way.
Let's go, boys! Let's go!
Come on, come on! Let's go!
Hmm.
[Sam] Let's go! Let's go!
Who's the worm now?
It's not me.
Fuck just happened?
We could go and see a show tonight. What about The Mouse Trap?
You know that Agatha Christie play where someone dies every performance?
Usually in the audience. Seeing as only old people go and see it.
Sure. If that's what you wanna do.
[gasps] Oh, the British Girl Shop. Wanna pop in?
Don't really play with dolls much anymore.
No, of course not.
Besides, why do all their dolls have to be tragically orphaned?
Mmm.
Edith's parents died in the war.
Emma's had scurvy.
[Rebecca] Yes.
The Americans really do the historical doll concept better, don't they?
Must be their innate sense of triumph, however misguided.
Yeah, but no one does the orphans better than us Brits.
[bell on door chimes] [grumbles] Thank you, Uncle Roy.
[door closes] I love her.
Oh, good.
[cell phone chimes] [message chime] [typing] [sighs] Right, so how'd her parents die? Factory fire? Eaten by rats?
No. Zoe's from the modern line.
Her parents were canceled.
So, what's happening with what's-his-name, from the steakhouse?
Who, John?
Yeah.
I dumped him.
'Cause of what I said?
No.
'Cause you were right about what you said.
So what now?
[sighs] Hell, I don't know.
Keeley's got me on that silly dating app she's promoting.
The one with no pictures?
That's the one.
What? So now you just get a bunch of unsolicited descriptions of dicks?
Uncle Roy, can we have ice cream for dinner?
No, that's dumb.
You're right. Thank you for helping me set boundaries.
Wow, she really loves you.
I know. It's fucking annoying.
[sighs] It's been really gorgeous reconnecting with Nora.
And I had all these things organized. Loads of activities.
She's not interested in any of it.
Look, most adults think kids need to be constantly entertained.
It's bullshit.
I didn't need a fucking parade every day growing up, did you?
Truth is they just wanna feel like they're part of our lives.
Hmm.
Little idiots.
Watch this.
Oi, Phoebe.
Do you wanna come to my podiatrist appointment later?
Yes, please!
[knocks] Hey, do you fancy watching a scary movie together?
I can make some popcorn.
Ah, you finally learned how to cook, did you?
[chuckles] Sounds fun. I'll be right down.
Great.
Oh, and, um, for tomorrow I was wondering-- I mean, it could be a terrible idea.
Would you want to come to work with me for, like, the whole day and just join me for meetings and stuff?
It could be tremendously boring.
That would be amazing.
Would it?
Yeah, I've always wanted to see what it's like to run a football club.
Really? Since when?
Ever since you started doing it.
I'll be down in a sec.
Okay.
Hey, Shannon.
Coach Beard asked me to give this to you.
Oh.
He had to run off.
Okay. Everything all right?
I don't know.
He mumbled the name Jane and then sprinted away.
Oh, okay. That makes sense.
What about you? You good?
When are you guys gonna finally win a match?
Geez louise, Shannon.
Not even Beard comes at me that strong this early, you know?
We like to start off with a little small talk, you know?
Like, uh, I'll say, "Hey, what's the word, Larry Bird?" Then he'll say-- "Don't call me Larry Bird and when are we gonna finally win a fucking match?" Yeah. Like that. See, much better. [chuckles] So, being the boss isn't just about reacting to situations.
It's also about anticipating them as well.
You need to be three, four steps ahead of everyone else around you.
Good morning, Higgins.
This is my goddaughter, Nora. She's going to be shadowing me today.
Ah, outstanding! Welcome aboard.
And, uh, Miss Welton, I received your email.
And once again your suggestion fixed everything.
I mean, brilliant as always.
What are you talking about?
I was just trying to make you look good.
Eh.
You blew that. [chuckles] Yeah, I did.
And obviously one of the perks of being in charge is having your own private sanctum.
Shit!
I didn't think you were coming in today.
When I know you're not gonna be here, sometimes I use your office.
I like the light and the absence of smells.
No worries. We had a change of plans.
Keeley, this is Nora.
Hey.
Nora, this is Keeley Jones. Our head of marketing.
Cuppa?
Mm.
Hmm.
I'm so excited to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you and I love your mum.
She's so cool. [chuckles] What's "Bantr"?
Oh, it's just a little side hustle gig. It's a new dating app.
This venture capital firm asked if I can do some freelance PR for them.
Cool. What's the hook?
It's pretty groovy actually.
They wanna be a less superficial dating app alternative.
It's completely anonymous, no photos.
It's all about encouraging people to connect using their words and personalities.
Yeah, so you don't know if the person you're communicating with is remotely fit or not.
Horrifying, isn't it?
I think that's awesome.
Yeah, no. Me too.
Cool. [chuckles] So, I downloaded Bantr last night.
Attaboy.
Hmm, looking for a lady, hey?
Oh, God, no. No, I deleted it immediately.
Besides, I am very picky when it comes to women.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[Nathan swallows] But women are pretty picky too, so… Yeah, I'm not really looking for anything romantic right now either.
But, boy, what if I did get on there and I met my soul mate and it changed the whole course of my life.
That'd be pretty neato. Yeah?
Yeah.
What about you, Coach? You get on there yet?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Uh, Jane and I took a big step forward in our relationship this weekend.
We are now sharing an iCloud account.
Ooh!
They call it digital intimacy.
Ooh, so if she found out that you downloaded a dating app… She would destroy my phone with pliers and a blowtorch. Yes.
Ooh. Oh.
[phone rings] [Higgins] Hi, darling.
Diamond Dogs adjourned?
[howling] [howls] [howls] Yeah, I was howling. Like a dog, yeah.
Hey, Jamie.
Hey, how you feeling today?
Eh, fucking great.
Yeah?
Yeah, I had this dope idea last night during me eyebrow threading.
I'm gonna buy the whole team PS5s. They'll fucking love me.
Yeah, but, you know, some folks might also consider that buying affection, you know.
Exactly.
Yeah, what better thing to spend money on than love? Hey?
[clicking tongue] Hmm, boy. He sure does thread that needle sometimes, don't he?
[sighs] Well, gentlemen, I think we might have ourselves a "break glass in case of emergency" situation here.
You know what we gotta do?
Get Dr. Sharon?
What? No. No, no, no.
No, I think it's time for these young fellas to meet… that guy.
[whistles] No. No, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
They don't need to meet that guy. They don't. Nobody does.
Don't worry, Coach. It's gonna be great.
All right. I'll see you in a little bit.
Who's "that guy"?
Led Tasso.
Who's Led Tasso?
The last resort.
Still doesn't really answer my question though, does it?
Who's Led Tasso?
So, our players have contracts that were signed when we were a premiership club.
But our current income is that of a championship club. Which means-- You're paying premiership rates for championship players, so financially the club's a bit fucked.
[stammers, chuckles] Sorry.
She got it quicker than Ted did.
[knocks] [Rebecca] Come in.
Sam! How nice to see you.
I apologize for interrupting.
[Rebecca] No, please.
Sam, this is my goddaughter, Nora.
Nora, this is Sam Ob-- Sam Obisanya.
Hi, Sam Obisanya.
Oh! Oh, yes. Yes. You guys used to watch Frozen together.
I have now watched that movie many times myself.
Oh.
It's a beautiful metaphor for many of life's journeys.
Yeah, especially puberty.
What can I help you with?
Well, um… I would like to pull out of my campaign with Dubai Air.
[gags] What? Why?
Well, it has come to my attention that Dubai Air's parent company, Cerithium Oil, is destroying Nigeria's environment.
And at the same time bribing government officials to look the other way.
I can't be the face of one of their subsidiaries.
Hell, yeah.
Look, Keeley, I'm really sorry. I know how hard you worked for this.
It's okay.
[Rebecca] Of course you don't have to do it, Sam.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
And, uh, lovely to meet you, Nora. [chuckles] He remembered my name.
[door closes] They are our sponsor.
We might need to give them a bell so we don't ruffle any feathers.
I will handle it.
The CEO of Cerithium Oil is an old friend of Rupert's.
[inhales sharply] Perhaps he'll still find me charming.
[grunting] [growls] Come here, you.
[yells, grunts] [grunting] Oh, that's Led Tasso.
Now I get it.
[grunting] The Ted you know is gone for now.
[grunts, yells] [blows whistle] Now listen up, you little turd birds!
Practice starts at 11 o'clock.
If you are not stretched five minutes early then you are 45 minutes late!
You understand me?
Do you understand me?
[Sam] Yes, Coach.
[Ted] Okay, good!
Now start touching your toes!
Touch your toes! Those are your feet fingers.
Let's go, dummies. Touch your toes.
And touch each other's toes!
What?
[Ted] You heard me!
Touch each other's toes! I don't wanna hear it.
Hands on toes. Someone else's toes besides your own.
[Colin] What muscle is this working?
Don't worry about it.
The only muscle I don't wanna see working right now is your mouth, Colin.
[Colin] Rojas!
[Dani] Yes.
Richard.
[Bumbercatch] Rojas!
[grunts] Bumbercatch!
Sorry, Coach.
Okay, you're sorry, hey?
I know y'all don't think it's a big deal messing up on these drills.
But let me tell you this right now.
The day we stop doing things the right way means we are one day closer to doing everything the wrong way.
Then what happens after that, huh?
What, you wanna make, uh, uh, this ball your girlfriend?
You gonna start taking it to places under your arm?
Having people compliment how y'all look together?
And then what?
You start caressing it and playing with, like, the little air hole nub?
Yeah? Messing around with that? Making out with it.
Making it your girlfriend. Is that what you wanna do?
Then when? You ask it to marry you? Huh?
Y'all wanna be married to a ball?
[scoffs] No.
[players chuckle] What did you say?
Uh, I-I said no.
Congratulations, Isaac.
That smart mouth of yours just earned you and the entire team ten laps.
Let's go!
Oh, what-- What are you-- Oh! Guess what? Make it a thousand laps. That's your fault too.
A thousand laps. Off you go! Let's go. Run.
What did we do?
Run, run, run, run, run, run. Run! Run!
Yeah, there you go.
Get them knees up! Get 'em by your nipples!
I hope y'all drank a lot of water today 'cause y'all are gonna be so dehydrated, that you're gonna look like one of them trees from a-- from a Tim Burton movie.
I'm talking any Tim Burton movie!
Even Dumbo!
Even freaking Dumbo.
[man] Rebecca, what a lovely surprise.
Hello, Richard.
So, are you in your second, third or fourth house?
[Richard laughs] I'm actually back on the yacht. Care to join me?
I don't think your new wife would enjoy that.
As long as she can watch, she doesn't mind.
Okay, Richard, I need to ask you a favor.
One of our players, Sam Obisanya, no longer wishes to participate in a Dubai Air ad campaign.
And I was hoping you'd be able to make that go away without much fuss.
Understood, Rebecca. That won't be a problem.
Excellent. Thank you so much, Richard.
Of course. And now, darling, I just need a favor from you.
Okay. But nothing scandalous, yes?
[Richard laughs] Of course not. Get rid of him.
I'm sorry?
Get rid of Obisanya. [chuckles] Thank you, my dear. Lovely talking with you.
It's on the left!
Richard, Richard, Richard!
Richard! Richard!
Right! Right! Right!
Richard!
I haven't seen a pass that soft since my high school drama teacher asked me to mow his lawn.
Is anybody on this pitch interested in not sucking at soccer?
All right, Coach. We get it. Just stop yelling at everyone.
[stammers] I don't know whatever this Jekyll and Hyde thing you got going on but just leave it out, yeah.
[laughs] Oh, okay. Okay.
You know what, Tartt? Practice is canceled.
Hit the showers. All of you. Let's go. Run.
Jamie just blew y'all's chance to get better.
Thanks, man.
That's how running looks. Let's run!
Let's go! Everybody to the showers!
[players muttering] Well, guess what? We start no people this weekend.
It'll be 11 versus zero.
What's the matter, O'Brien? Your butt still hurt?
Unbelievable. [muttering] What?
How long was I out?
Doesn't matter. You're back now.
Okay.
[Sharon] Well, that was interesting.
Oh, thank you, Doc.
Yeah, little something we came up with back in Kansas.
See, what we're doing is-- You pretend to be an asshole.
So the team make you their common enemy and not Jamie.
Yeah. Spot on. Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah. Got it right away.
Has it ever worked?
Uh… Uh… [Ted] Trying to remember.
Uh, Chuck E. Cheese?
Chuck E. Cheese. That's right!
Yeah, we were at a, uh, arcade/pizza joint in Lincoln, Nebraska.
And one of our offensive linemen got his head stuck in a VR machine.
Ended up getting the entire meal and all our beverages comped for free, so… Maybe they don't have Chuck E. Cheese here.
Oh, yeah.
Y'all might call it something different here.
Like, uh, Charles Edgar Cheeserton III or something, right?
He's a mouse but he's also a musician.
And he loves video games and pizza.
I'm sure.
Mm-hmm.
[chuckles] Okay, we could release Sam. Which we're not gonna do.
Oh, no.
Or we can tell the CEO of our biggest sponsor to piss off.
Which I doubt we can do. [sighs] Yeah. This is just like the time I got in trouble for chewing gum in the bathroom.
You got in trouble for chewing gum?
No, I was smoking. But I don't want a lecture.
I'll allow it. Go on.
I was with my friend Sarah, who we call "Pimp", when a teach came in and busted her.
I was hiding in the loo and I could have just stayed there but he started to get a bit shitty with her.
So, I decided to come out and we both ended up getting suspended.
Mum freaked out and I had to watch a three-hour video about cancer.
[inhales deeply] Point is, Aunt Stinky, sometimes you have to do the right thing even if you lose.
Yes.
Yes, you do.
[knocks] Hi, Jamie.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Actually, Sam just quit the Dubai Air gig. So I'm scrambling a bit.
That's stupid of him.
Do you want me to do it?
What do you want, Jamie?
Well, [sighs] just wanted to talk.
About what?
[sighs] I'm just super frustrated 'cause I don't know how to let the team know I'm cool now, and it's just really fucking with me head.
Walk with me.
Come on.
I mean, if they wanna be little bitches about actually having someone on the pitch who can score a goal, then what?
Am I supposed to just walk around with me head down?
No.
It's like they're holding onto some silly grudge.
I mean, it's not my fault I'm special.
[knocks] Hi.
Hi.
Jamie, this is Dr. Fieldstone.
She's a brilliant therapist and, unlike me, she actually gets paid to listen to you complain.
[door closes] So, what? Do I just… sit here and blather on and on about meself?
Basically.
Nice.
Hey, dick hole.
"Dear Richard Cole." You creepy old pedo.
"My old friend." Sam isn't going anywhere, asshole.
"I have decided not to release Sam Obisanya." You're a shitty old man with a tiny, shriveled penis.
I feel sorry for your wife. Her life must be a constant hell.
"Please give Daphne my love." Sincerely, boss ass bitch.
"Sincerely, boss ass bitch." [both laughing] Welcome to Soccer Saturday.
We have a massive afternoon of action for you today across all the divisions.
I'm your host, Jeff Stelling here with Mr. Unbelievable himself, Chris Kamara.
A man who's coached seemingly every club in England, including yours, George Cartrick.
And still getting comfortable in his new seat on our set, it's the legendary Chelsea hard man, Roy Kent.
Welcome, Roy.
[George chuckles] Well said. [clears throat] Of course, last time we saw Roy Kent on the pitch was with AFC Richmond, battling against relegation.
And occasionally against other Richmond players.
[Arlo] What is this?
Kent and Tartt are at each other's throats!
[George laughing] Well, the big story today is the return of that same teammate.
The controversial Jamie Tartt.
The ex-Manchester City starlet and Lust Conquers All reject has his first match back with Richmond.
[inhales sharply] Any thoughts, Roy?
Jamie Tartt is a muppet.
And I hope he dies of the incurable condition of being a little bitch.
[George laughs] Right.
Don't hold back, Roy.
Yeah, come on. Tell us how you really feel.
Okay. You're a shit manager.
Not about me, you twat!
Language, boys!
Well, he asked for it.
He did ask for it.
[Kamara chuckles] [chattering] [phone chimes] [chuckles] Bantr's horrifying, is it?
I'm going to insult something and then try it because I'm a good friend.
[giggles] [chuckles] A-hootie hoo.
Sassy!
I thought you weren't coming back till Sunday?
What? And miss 22 fit, sweaty men running around chasing one another?
[chuckles, gasps] Did you meet Sam Obisanya?
That's her favorite player.
Oh, Mum.
[squeals, giggles] [sighs] What are you doing?
What, Dubai Air not paying you enough?
[laughing] No, no. Dubai Air is owned by a horrible company.
One that has turned the southern coast of Nigeria, my home, into a hellish, fiery swamp.
I can no longer wear their name on my chest.
Never again.
Give me the tape, bruv.
Can I ask it?
Hey, listen. I do not expect you all to do this.
But I hope you understand why we as Nigerians must.
Throw me the tape?
What do you think you're doing?
We're a team, ain't we?
Gotta wear the same kit.
Live from the Dogtrack, it's Arlo White here with Chris Powell.
Today Coventry City take on the home team, AFC Richmond, who remain winless with eight straight draws.
Any predictions, Chris?
Yeah, I think it's gonna be a draw.
Makes sense.
But the story everyone is talking about is the return of Jamie Tartt.
Chris, will the Richmond faithful welcome him back?
Tough to say, Arlo. Supporters are a notoriously fickle bunch.
♪ Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo ♪ ♪ Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo ♪ If no one's passing to Jamie we can always drop him to midfield.
So the people not passing to Jamie can be closer to him?
[zippers opening] [crowd chattering] Cheers.
Thanks, mate.
[chattering] [shutters clicking] What's that now?
[applause] [Powell] What's going on here, Arlo?
[Arlo] It appears to be some sort of protest against Richmond's sponsor, Dubai Air.
This might become an issue.
[phone buzzing] Hmm.
[buzzing stops] Boss ass bitch.
[chattering] [shutters clicking] [reporters clamoring] Hey, hey. Easy. Easy. Hey, take it easy, all right?
One at a time, please. Okay.
Go ahead, Gary, what have you got?
Yeah, Ted, did you know the team were gonna do that?
No, sir. No, no.
But I think what Sam and the team did today was courageous.
I-I've never needed to have that kind of courage.
'Cause, well, honestly when bad things happen to, uh, people like me y'all have a tendency to write about it without being asked.
Sam had to go and get y'all's attention, you know?
So, if you have any more you wanna know about it, you can ask him.
Come on, Sam.
[reporters clamoring] Sam! Sam! Sam!
Um, hello.
Um… Thank you. Trent Crimm, The Independent.
Sam, do you think that your protest may have distracted the team tonight and lead to the loss?
I'm not here to talk about football.
I'm here to ask the Nigerian government to put an end to decades of environmental destruction caused by Cerithium Oil.
Destruction that the powers that be have turned a blind eye towards for far too long.
Do you have any questions about that?
[Trent] Yes, I do.
[reporters clamoring] Follow-up question, please. Thank you.
Sam, are you openly accusing the Nigerian government of corruption?
Yes, I am.
[reporters clamoring] Sam!
[breathes shakily] How are you feeling?
Uh, good. I think.
I just hope the rest of the team is not upset with me.
Mmm.
Hey, doing the right thing is never the wrong thing. Yeah.
[players chattering] There he is!
[cheering] What's going on?
We are celebrating!
But we lost.
Yeah, but we broke the tie streak.
[cheers, laughs] Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!
A toast to Sam, who did something incredible tonight.
The little Nigerian prick stole my thunder.
[laughing] No, but seriously. To Sam.
To Sam!
Thank you, guys.
Well done, bruv.
I appreciate it.
[Jamie] Took a lot of courage, man.
It's good to have you back.
Yeah, it's good to be back, bruv.
Please don't do this to me.
[Rebecca] 'Scuse me, chaps.
Sam, could Nora get a picture, please?
Oh, hello.
Oh, yes, yes! Of course.
Hey, guys! Guys! We're gonna take a picture for Nora.
[players cheering] [Dani] I want to be in the front.
[Isaac] Nora, you all right?
You okay? Yeah?
Yeah! Yeah.
She's gonna absolutely love this.
Oh, my God. Look.
[Rebecca] Love it and hate it.
[Keeley] So cute!
Oi, hide your beers!
Oh! Oh, shit.
[laughs] Thank you.
Greyhounds on three! One, two, three!
[all] Greyhounds!
[cheering, laughing] [Rebecca] Ah!
[Sassy] Okay, got it!
 @@@@@@
["Christmas In Hollis" playing] [players cheering] [music continues on radio] A scarf. Cool.
Bumbercatch, did you make this?
Yeah, man, knitting soothes me.
Sorry. I didn't know everyone was doing booze.
Nah, mate. Cheers! This is great.
I can wrap it around my booze.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Colin.
[cheering] Dani Rojas, approach.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
May your Secret Santa reveal himself.
[all] Ooh!
[cheering] [man] And more booze!
All right. Let's see here.
["Mele Kalikimaka" playing on radio] Aw. Nate, is this a photo of you and me after our first win?
Yeah.
Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it.
Look at that.
"Ted, thank you for everything you've done for me. Nathan." Aw!
Aw. What a lovely inscription, that you wrote completely over my head, face and body.
Sorry.
[players cheering] Secret Santa's a fun new tradition. As is a half-day for Christmas.
Well, I think we gotta be responsible.
We gotta save our legs for tomorrow's big game.
So, to responsibility.
Being responsible.
Responsibility.
And if we get this Boxing Day win, we'll finally have more wins than losses.
Coach, what are you doing the rest of the day?
I'm just spending it with my family.
I finally make enough money to buy something nice for my dad.
He can be very tricky to shop for.
Oh, he's one of them fellas that buys everything for himself, huh?
Oh, I wish. No, he just hates everything.
What about you, Coach?
Uh, Jane and I are going to a pagan Christmas ritual at Stonehenge.
What? I thought you two broke up.
We did, but we got the tickets before we broke up.
So, we're going as friends.
Mmm, that's gonna be, uh… What about you, Keeley? What are you guys getting into?
Roy and I are celebrating a new tradition that I'm calling "Sexy Christmas." [all] Ooh!
It's not gonna be like that. It's gonna be a swinging-- [all] Ooh!
A swinging Sinatra, Vegas-y type Christmas for adults where we get all dressed up, and we sip on martinis, sit by the fire.
And then it's gonna be like that.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[grunting] Awooga! [cackles] [Higgins chortles] You're talking about Sexy Christmas.
Maybe.
Hey, boss.
Let me get you a drink, yeah?
Ooh, yes. Thank you.
How you spending the rest of Santa's birthday?
I'm going to a Christmas party at a friend's house.
What friend's that? First and last name, please.
Elton John.
Whoa.
Holy shit!
Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer, Prancer and Vixen.
[laughs] Yes. Yes. It's actually rather lovely.
We just sing carols around Elton's piano, and hopefully Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig will do their puppet show again.
Mmm, that sounds like double-O heaven to me.
[chuckles] What about you, Higgins?
Ah, the Higginses will be opening Christmas presents and then hosting an open house for players who don't have family in town.
Aw!
Something we do every year. We usually get about, um, two.
It's really nice. You're more than welcome, Ted.
I appreciate that offer, Higgie Smalls. But I am all good, baby, baby.
This is the first Christmas the family's away from each other, so, you know, once Henry wakes up here, in about an hour, he wants us to open presents and spend all day together on FaceTime.
It's gonna be a lovely afternoon of yuletide cheer in two dimensions.
Hey. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Keeley.
Merry Christmas.
How you doin'? What can I help you with?
Have you got anythin' that I can give as a present?
Did you not buy a Secret Santa gift?
I didn't know I had to.
The email said "Secret Santa." I didn't wanna ruin the surprise, did I?
Oh, Jamie.
You know what, hold on here.
Yep, here you go. Higgins, look alive. [grunts] [music continues on radio] What are you doin'? No, no.
Here comes a little magic pixie dust.
[Ted] Whoo! There's your Christmas miracle.
[music continues] God bless me… everyone.
[players cheering] Wow.
[theme music plays] ["Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" playing on gramophone] [grunts, gags] [doorbell rings] [Keeley] Whoo.
[music continues] [softly] Okay.
Yep.
Merry Sexy Christmas!
Phoebe.
Didn't get my text, did ya?
Uh… What did it say?
My sister got called to surgery, so Phoebe's got to spend Sexy Christmas with us.
Oh, right. Okay.
Phoebe, I'm sorry you can't spend Christmas with your mum.
But we'll have fun together, yeah?
[Phoebe] Please just leave me alone.
[Roy] Apparently, she's been like this all week.
Won't talk about it.
I am sorry. I know this does make Christmas significantly less sexy.
Oh, don't worry about it. We can do Sexy Boxing Day.
Can't. I've got a match all day. Working.
I can't do the day after.
Sexy December 28th.
28th. Sexiest of all the days.
Yeah.
Holy fucking shit. You look incredible.
[giggles] ["Little Saint Nick" playing on radio] [all] Ooh!
♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun! Dun-dun-dun! ♪ ♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun! Dun! ♪ Ooh! What could it be?
Clearly the surfboard I asked for.
[all chanting] Rip it, rip it, rip it, rip it!
[Julie] Ooh!
[Higgins] Yay!
Ah, perfect!
Okay.
Guests arriving in an hour, time to clean up.
[doorbell rings] I'll get it!
Ooh. [chuckles] Merry Christmas, and welcome to our home.
Oh, hello! [chuckles] Hey!
Sorry. I know I'm early, but I was in the neighborhood and I really need to use the restroom.
Oh, no, no. Sam, come in. Come in.
Thank you.
Come through. It's a bit of a mess, but… [chuckles] Yeah.
[Sam] Oh, wow.
Oh, yeah. To hold us off until dinner we have mince pies, cheese and crackers, pigs in blankets, mulled wine. All the favorites.
[chuckles] So, uh, Sam, back home, what does Christmas make you think of?
Colonization.
Of course.
Uh, but I'm more than happy to celebrate the day with you.
Uh, back home in Lagos, we have good friends who celebrate, and they always eat jollof rice and goat meat, so I made you some.
Oh.
But I used chicken.
Thank God.
Mr. Obisanya, it was so cool what you done with that Dubai Air logo.
Fuck those guys.
Yes, fuck 'em.
[all chuckle] Whoo! [chuckles] [chuckles, sighs] I'm really sorry, but where's your restroom?
Right. Of course. Yes. Back through here.
Uh, to your left there, Sam.
["I'll Be Home For Christmas" playing] Okay. All right. Now it's my turn.
Let's see what we got here.
Did you wrap these yourself? 'Cause this is very well done.
Uh-oh. Oh, boy.
Is this what I think it is? Hold on here.
Oh! Wait a minute.
Is this a tiny dartboard or did I become a giant?
It's a mini dartboard. Do you like it?
Oh.
That's very smart. No, I don't like it. I love it! Thank you.
All right, your turn. Come on. Open up the big one.
I wanna see what you think.
A drone? Dad, you got me a drone!
Wh-- I know. How irresponsible is that of me?
Considering all the issues with privacy these days.
And you know what? Mrs. Claus charged that puppy up last night.
So, you should be good to go.
Can I try it out now?
Heck yeah! Yeah, it's no fun just keeping it in the box.
Great!
Oh, boy. Okay. Whoa, whoa.
Be careful. Easy.
Mom, here.
[Michelle chuckling] Oh, you lost him.
Yeah, no. That's gonna happen. Should have got him socks.
Sorry, Ted. He's just so excited. [chuckles] No, that's okay. I get it.
[Henry] Nice!
How are you?
Oh, I'm-- I'm good. Yeah. You know, just plugging away over here.
We got a big match tomorrow so everybody's focused on that, and-- Oh, Henry, careful! No, not in the house! [sighs] Sorry, Ted.
Uh, it's okay. Uh, you go. Go have fun, and send me photos, okay?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Ted.
[drone thuds] [Henry] Uh-oh.
Henry, careful! The baseboards! Oh, geez. I-- [call disconnects] [music continues] Shoot.
Phoebe, whatever it is, we just wanna try and make it better.
What have you got to be sad about? Did one of the Paw Patrol dogs die?
[inhales sharply] Listen, Phoebe, problems, they're like mushrooms, yeah?
The longer you leave them in the dark, the bigger they get.
A boy at school was mean to me.
What did he do?
"Merry Christmas, Phoebe. I got you something you desperately need.
Your Secret Santa, Bernard." Who the fuck is Bernard?
Why did Bernard get you toothpaste and mouthwash for Christmas, babe?
Because he told everyone my breath is rancid.
Right, where does Bernard live?
Roy, we are not going to go beat up a little kid.
Why not?
Why do you think? Fucking knobhead.
Phoebe, listen.
Some kids are just mean little dickheads, yeah?
I bet your breath doesn't smell that bad. Come on.
Phoebe, it's me.
Let me have a smell. Come on.
[blows] [stammers] [gagging] Oh, wow.
Oi! She feels bad enough!
I'm so sorry. I really tried. [gags] It cannot be that bad.
Go away!
Phoebe.
I'm a monster.
I've spent the last 20 years in locker rooms with men.
I promise you, I've smelled worse.
I don't know.
[Keeley stammers] Come on.
I think you might be dying.
Sweetheart, listen. That is not like "I forgot to brush my teeth" bad.
[gagging] Or like, "I ate onions" bad.
That's actually medically bad. Which means it's not your fault.
Come here.
[Roy] Right. I'm gonna sort this.
Put your coats on.
Where are we going?
We're going to my stupid posh neighborhood, and we're gonna start knocking on doors.
And if we don't find a dentist in 10 houses, you each get £1,000.
[gasps] Let's go get our coats.
Yeah!
Quick, quick, quick, quick!
Run, run, run, run, run!
[Sam chuckles] Did Santa get you something good this morning?
It's okay. I know there's no Santa.
But of course there's a Santa.
There's no way he can deliver presents to everyone in the world in one night!
Ah, but it's not the whole world in one night.
It's the whole world split up into 24 different time zones.
You see, Santa's true power is not his speed but his endurance.
[doorbell rings] Wow.
He got me a bicycle.
Brilliant. [chuckles] [players] Hey!
Merry Christmas!
Feliz Navidad!
Merry Christmas.
Look at that! Hello! Thank you for coming.
Oh, of course. My mother was very happy I wouldn't be alone on Christmas and insisted I bring a traditional Mexican ponche!
Ooh!
If you want to be a little bit cheeky, you can put some tequila in it.
Dani, it already smells like it has tequila in it.
Yes, this one is pre-cheeked.
Hey! What a turnout! Welcome! Welcome!
Cool!
Hello.
A Montlaur family tradition.
Uh, we have foie gras, champagne, and a fancy stinky cheese.
Ooh! [speaks French] Whoa! [chuckles] And this time you try it.
Okay.
Hey!
I brought fried chicken.
Ah, is that a Christmas tradition in Holland?
No.
Oh.
Yo! [laughs] Hey!
I just walked into your neighbor's house!
Oh, my God. What's up?
[laughs] [Thierry] Yes! Let's get drunk.
[somber music plays on television] [music continues] [thud on window] [man on TV] Help!
Help! Help! [screams] Hey, boss!
How's FaceTime Christmas with Henry going?
Well, I lost him to an overpriced guilt gift.
Hubris, thy name is Ted.
Grab a coat. You're coming with me.
Yes, ma'am.
And wear the hat. It's a nice touch.
Okay.
["Last Christmas" playing in distance] [sighs] Where are we going?
You know what? Don't tell me. Don't tell me. That's all right.
Actually, hold on. We're not going to Elton John's holiday party, are we?
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be severely underdressed.
I could run right back upstairs and pop on this Donald Duck suit I bring with me everywhere.
[laughs] You look perfect, don't worry.
All right. I appreciate it.
Oh.
♪ Last Christmas I gave you my heart ♪ ♪ But the very next day you gave it away ♪ [buskers, together] ♪ This year… ♪ I love the buskers y'all got over here.
Always reminds me of that movie, Once. You ever see that?
Ah, great film.
Yeah.
Yeah, I loved Once so much, I saw it twice.
♪ I gave you my heart ♪ ♪ But the very next day ♪ ♪ You gave it away ♪ ♪ This year, to save me from tears ♪ ♪ I'll give it to someone special ♪ Oh, shit.
[man beatboxing] I guess that's what I get for taking a tinkle next to John Holmes.
Yeesh.
[laughs] Come on.
Merry Christmas. Thank you.
Merry Christmas, y'all.
[beatboxing continues] [car unlocks] You drove yourself, huh?
That's a Christmas miracle.
Oi, wanker.
Merry Christmas.
Right back at ya, sir.
Did he just call you a wanker?
Yeah, it's an inside joke.
Mostly inside of him.
[children chattering] [doorbell rings] Whoa, Roy Kent!
You gonna sing?
No, we're not carolers. Is your mum or dad a dentist?
No, they're lawyers.
Figures. Come on.
Thank you.
Uncle Roy, this is embarrassing.
This isn't embarrassing.
Embarrassing is me eating so much ice cream at a birthday party, knowing I'm no good with dairy, that I poop my pants on the bus.
Finish your story.
Three weeks ago.
[chuckles] Sweetheart, none of this is your fault.
And the sooner we figure it out, the better, yeah?
You pooped your pants? Roy Kent?
Yeah, so?
I do too, sometimes.
Well… let's both try and knock that off, shall we?
If you can do it, I can do it.
Cool?
Cool.
Merry Christmas!
Bye!
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go! [grunting] We're not gonna make it.
[panting] Tell my incredibly beautiful wife I love her.
I'm not gonna do that, 'cause you'll tell her yourself.
Then you're gonna hook me up with her identical, beautiful twin sister.
Good luck, mi amigo.
Bonne chance, mon ami.
[toy gun cocks] Eat Nerf!
[screaming] [both grunting] [announcer speaking indistinctly] ["Santa Baby" playing] Richard.
Hmm?
Why did you bring a date to the team Christmas party?
The French believe that having a beautiful woman around is always a good thing.
That was not true with the Helter Skelter murders.
[doorbell rings] [all] Hey!
Cheers, darling.
Cheers.
[player] Hey!
You've become quite popular, Leslie.
This is by far the most people we've ever had.
[all] Merry Christmas!
Hey!
Welcome, guys!
Merry Christmas!
Well, at least we've got plenty of food and drink.
Yeah.
[players cheer] But, um, where are we all gonna sit down and eat it?
["It's Beginning to Look A Lot Like Christmas" playing] [cheering] [music ends] [doorbell rings] Mom! There are two white people at the door and they're smiling!
Can I help you?
Good afternoon.
We work for Santa Claus, and I believe he received this.
My letter.
Yes, we're terribly sorry that your presents didn't arrive last night.
But as elves we've been personally directed by Mr. and Mrs. Claus to deliver your presents this afternoon and to apologize for the delay.
Am I forgetting anything?
Well, you see what happened was Rudolph's nose shined so brightly that it rendered me unable to see, and I was-- I was, uh, delirious for several minutes.
And I ended up putting this whole sack of goodies on the wrong sled.
[chuckles] I mean, you know, ain't that nuts?
Uh, anyway, this bad boy's been around the world at least twice over the past day so, uh… Yeah, you smell that? That's the Himalayas right there.
That's all for you.
[mother gasps] Am I getting notes of Beijing?
Oh, I bet you are, yeah.
[chuckles] Thank you.
[chuckles] You're so welcome.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
[door closes] On to the next?
Heck yeah. [chuckles] ["Carol of the Bells" playing] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] Hey, guys! Amazing! Amazing!
Hey!
[doorbell rings] House number ten, Uncle Roy.
Oi, Phoebs. We can't lose.
Either we find out why your breath is so rancid, or we get £1,000!
Each! That's like a month worth of swear words.
Hold on, I've gotta fix my knee.
[bones crack] [groans] Whoa! Are you Roy Kent?
Yeah. Are you a dentist?
Yeah.
Can we come in?
Thank you so much. This will only take a second.
Your house is lovely!
["Deck The Halls" playing] Well, congratulations, Phoebe. That is some spectacularly bad breath.
Thank you.
Have you been under any unusual stress lately?
Not if I do my breathing exercises.
Have you been smoking?
[chuckles] No!
Any new medications?
Just my antihistamines.
They got a new cat. She's allergic.
Her name is Dauphine.
My mum said that we rescued her, but I'd like to think that she rescued us.
Ah, well, that's it then, Phoebe.
Antihistamines dry out the mouth, and when saliva production is reduced, then the environment for odor-producing bacteria thrives.
And thrive it has.
Might be time to say au revoir to Dauphine.
No!
Come on, Phoebe.
You've only had her a month.
But we're soul mates.
Phoebe, no one is gonna make you get rid of Dauphine. Okay?
Because that would be an insane thing for your uncle, who loves you and who is not a monster, to suggest.
And I'm sure Dr. Rogers has another solution because she's nice and smart, and science is real, and it's Christmas!
Right?
Yeah.
Thank you!
Yo! Can I get an ussie?
Fine. [sighs] Not with you, mate. With Keeley.
I mean, you're a legend at Chelsea but shit at Richmond.
But Keeley Jones was a seminal figure throughout my teenage years.
How about this, why don't we all take a picture together?
By the tree.
Wicked!
Mmm.
[chattering] Un, deux, trois. [groans] Oh! Oh, you brought jollof.
With goat meat? Ah, yes!
Original.
You want to try some goat?
Okay. Are you sure?
Oh, no!
[chattering continues] Oh, no!
Mmm!
Yes!
No!
I never win.
Cheers.
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
See, doesn't it feel better to solve the problem than go beat up a little kid?
Mmm.
Oi, you got any poster board and markers?
For another hundred quid.
Cheers.
[Ted] That was pretty dang neat. Thanks for letting me tag along.
Oh, my pleasure.
How long have you been doing this?
[sighs] For years, but then Rupert… You know, I should have done it last year, but I just sat by myself instead.
Drinking and plotting horrible things.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
Look, I know all too well how stunningly shitty the first Christmas after you get divorced can be.
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
Yeah, well, I am now, you know.
A lot better than I would have been if I just drank whiskey all day and watched It's a Wonderful Life on repeat.
That could have gone dark.
[both chuckle] So, uh, what now?
Oh, I figured you could just drop me off at home and then go get all decked out for Sir Elton's party.
Ah, I might not go.
Really?
You're willing to miss a puppet show by Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz?
'Cause that sounds like a lot of fun.
Don't get me wrong, they are incredible.
But all I really want to see those two do together is fuck.
Yeah, no. I get that. Yeah. You got any other ideas then?
You'll see.
Huh? Oh, you want me to drive?
The steering wheel's on this side.
Right, I'm the one with the accent here.
I forgot. Sorry.
Mmm.
[doorbell rings] [man] Who is it?
["Silent Night" plays on phone] It's carol singers.
[man] Just give 'em a quid and tell 'em to bugger off.
[music continues on phone] [growls] [whispers] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Phoebe.
["Fairy Tale Of New York" playing] [guests chattering, laughing] I just wanna thank you all for coming.

…and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

I know you would have preferred to have been with them, but it was truly an honor to have you with us to share our traditions and help make a few new ones.

["Swinging on a Rainbow" playing] [bangs on door] Good afternoon.
Sorry, I was waiting for you to ask if-- if I needed anything.
So, this is my mom and dad's favorite restaurant and Friday's their 35th wedding anniversary, Jade.
How do you know my name?
Oh, I don't. That's what the 35th wedding anniversary is: Jade.
Oh, weird. What time, then?
Oh, 7:30, three people and really wanna make sure we get the window table.
[Stelling] You've got all the divisions… I have to talk to Derrick.
…former England international… Oh.
…Chris Kamara.
[Kamara] It was an unbelievable performance.
Do you mind just turning that up? Thank you.
[Kamara] I couldn't believe it!
Looking into the championship now, Roy, your old mob in Richmond, uh, struggling.
There are a lot of theories as to why that might be.
One that's gaining traction is a lack of leadership from your successor as captain, Isaac McAdoo.
Isaac's a good lad. He'll find his way.
You know, under Ted Lasso, Richmond, well, they're like a woman behind the wheel: completely lost!
George! Didn't you lose your license drink driving?
That was an allergic reaction to my medication.
The same medication that made you piss your pants?
[laughing] [laughing continues] [chuckles] [Stelling continues] Nothing coming up… So, did-- Did the-- Hey. Hi.
Good news.
Oh!
We can set aside the table in the corner for you.
Wonderful. Um, I just-- I would really like the window table, you know, just to impress my dad.
I'm sorry. I can't guarantee a reservation for the window table.
I know Roy Kent, if that's-- Is he your dad?
No.
Well, please let us know if Mr. Kent ever wants the window table.
W-- Okay. Thank you.
[theme song plays] [players shouting] [man shouts] [crowd cheering] [shouting] Jan Maas, that's shit defending.
Yes, that goal was entirely my fault.
I don't wanna hear it. We need to get our shit together!
Hey, hit pause for me, will you? Hey, fellas.
[blows] No, I gave you an indoor whistle.
Listen, I don't care what our record is, but I hear the chatter, people saying there's something wrong with us.
Not the way I see it, okay?
And here's why: I believe in communism.
[players murmuring] Rom-communism, that is.
[players murmuring] What is rom-communism?
Well, Bumbercatch, it is a worldview that reminds us that romantic comedies with folks like Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan or, uh, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant or-- Who am I missing, Coach?
Drew Barrymore?
Mm-hmm.
Matthew McConaughey, obviously.
All right, all right. Yeah.
The three Kates.
Yeah, Beckinsale, Hudson, Winslet.
You forgot Blanchett.
Different spelling.
I enjoy Renée Zellweger and all the Bridget Jones movies.
Mmm.
I mean, her accent is pitch perfect and her gift of physical comedy is grossly underrated.
Word!
Hell yeah!
[Ted] Absolutely!
I saw Judy… All right, you've gotta give it up for Zellweger.
Look, point is, fellas, if all those attractive people with their amazing apartments and interesting jobs, usually in some creative field, can go through some lighthearted struggles and still end up happy, then so can we.
Jennifer Lopez!
That's a great call, Dani, and not at all a beat too late.
Gentlemen, believing in rom-communism is all about believing that everything's gonna work out in the end.
Now these next few months might be tricky, but that's just 'cause we're going through our dark forest.
Fairy tales do not start, nor do they end in the dark forest.
That son of a gun always shows up smack-dab in the middle of a story.
But it will all work out.
Now, it may not work out how you think it will or how you hope it does, but believe me, it will all work out.
Exactly as it's supposed to.
Our job is to have zero expectations and just let go.
Now, you heard him!
We need to stop playing like shit!
Yeah, not exactly what I said, but I appreciate you, Isaac.
Okay, let's watch the second half. Come on, Coach.
[Nathan blows] Hey, anyone know what's going on with Isaac?
I got no idea. No.
Maybe it's piles.
Ah.
I've accepted "aubergine" and "snogging", but "piles" I will not abide.
Wait a second, we play Sheffield Wednesday?
Saturday.
Oh, we're playing Sheffield Saturday?
Sheffield Wednesday, Saturday.
We gotta play 'em twice in the same week?
[inhales deeply] The club is called Sheffield Wednesday.
We play them on Saturday.
They're called Sheffield Wednesday because they used to only play on Wednesdays.
But nowadays they play on whatever day they feel like, including, but not limited to, Saturdays, which, again, is the day we will be playing them.
This Saturday? I can't. I got plans.
I'm leaving.
Oh, come on.
[knocks] Hey, Doc.
Good afternoon. Coach Lasso, is Isaac okay?
No, ma'am, he is not.
Nah, he's a wigwam in a tepee right now.
What does that mean?
He's too tense.
[both] Boom!
He's wound tighter than my nan's hairnet.
That only makes sense if you know my nan, but when she wears a hairnet it looks like puppies are trying to escape from it.
Mmm.
I am not crazy.
Do you want me to talk to Isaac?
No. That's okay. We got it.
I know exactly what Isaac needs. Thank you, though.
Okay.
What does Isaac need?
Oh, I have no idea.
No, usually in this situation I'd have a player talk to the team captain before I intervened.
But Isaac's our captain.
Exactly.
And I can't very well ask Isaac to pull himself aside.
'Cause that would be dangerously close to messing with the, what's it?
The dark arts?
No, no.
Space-time continuum?
That's it, yeah.
Oh.
Fact is, Isaac is a big dog, you know?
So he's only going to respond to a big dog himself.
[deep exhale] I'll do it.
[chuckles] Oh, you're being serious?
You didn't laugh.
You knew he was being serious?
Yeah, man.
Shoot. Busted.
Um, I'm sorry about that, Nate.
But I do appreciate the offer, you know?
I think we gotta get him a real big dog.
Yeah, no, goo-- Me too.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah.
Okay. Let's see here.
I'm okay with "fanny".
[softly] One, two, three… [phone buzzes] [Rebecca chuckles] Hmm.
Did you just giggle?
I don't know. Did I?
Maybe.
And now you're doubling down as Shy Rebecca, who is a fictional character.
She does not actually exist, so something's up.
[chuckles] [players chattering] Hey, boys!
Come get your free Nespresso coffee machines because I'm amazing at my job!
People who are amazing at their job don't have to point it out.
Actually, that's not how it works anymore. It's all about promoting your own brand.
Oi! Please don't forget to post when you make yourselves an Americano.
I'll put something on my Insta straightaway.
Thanks, Colin. Oh, wait!
Do you think you can make this one post not about Welsh independence?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Thank you.
So can I, like, give this back to you and you give me cash?
Is that a thing, or… No.
Oh, yeah. Ok-- Okay.
[phone chimes] [gasps] All right, what the fuck?
Sorry. It's just this mystery man that I've been talking to on Bantr has just quoted Rilke.
"Our deepest fears are like dragons guarding our deepest treasures".
Oh, that is so hot.
Maybe you're writing letters to a hung poet.
Is that a joke from Sex and The City?
No, but thank you.
I love that you're so excited.
That's so Bantr, a place where minds can come to undress.
That's really good. I'm gonna use that.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still chatting to these other guys on the other dating app, Tumescent.
Yeah, and what was that discourse like?
Less revealing, but more revealing.
Jesus, where's the rest of it?
Christ.
I mean, shouldn't romance have a little mystery to it?
Sure, it depends on what you want.
Hmm.
See?
It all comes back to branding, even with love.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Oh, Dani! Enjoy your free coffee.
Oh, I don't drink coffee. My mother says I was born caffeinated.
Is it okay if I give it to my neighbor?
She also doesn't drink coffee but her son does.
And she's trying to encourage more visits from him.
Sure!
[chuckles] ¡Excelente!
Oh, yeah! [chuckles] Oh, wow. Look at this.
Sorry, Nate.
They're actually just for the players.
Oh. Oh, good.
Oh, I hate free coffee anyway, always tastes so, um… Yeah. Fine.
[Higgins] Hello, Rebecca.
[gasps] Ah! Hello, Higgins.
What can I help you with?
Payroll.
[clears throat] Um, we have an inquiry from AFC Wrexham.
Just got a call from their new owners, showbiz magnates Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds.
I can't tell if them buying the club is a joke or not, so I haven't replied to them yet.
Right. Did you just see what was on my screen?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
[sighs] I have five boys.
I never look over anyone's shoulders to see what's on their screens.
I used to.
["She's a Rainbow" playing on cell phone] Oh, apologies!
That's my wife.
Hmm.
Uh, I'll ring her back later. Keeps it fresh.
Hmm.
But I'll just text her real quick to let her know that.
So your ringtone for your wife is "She's a Rainbow" by the Rolling Stones?
Yeah.
That's awfully affectionate.
Yeah, well, it's our song.
It was playing the moment we met.
And, uh, it's not an exaggeration. She really is my rainbow.
It is so odd to imagine you young.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
I was the only kid in primary school with sciatica.
I had a gelatinous L4 and five.
Mmm.
Leslie, do you mind me asking, when you first met your wife, how did you put yourself across?
You know, what was your brand?
"Brand"?
Well, you know, the night I met my wife, I was attempting to be a brooding punk with hair spiked out to here.
And then, uh, "She's a Rainbow" came on and I started playing upright air bass but I had a pint in my hand and ended up pouring beer all over my head.
Oh!
Everyone in the bar laughed, except one person who handed me a damp, disgusting bar towel.
And I've been married to her for 29 years.
I suppose… the best brand is just being yourself.
[Higgins hums] [blows raspberry] [sighs] It's fine.
[swallows] Nate?
Yeah?
Do you need something?
No, me? No, me? No, thank you. No, but-- Actually, there is possibly one thing you might be able to help with.
Yeah, come sit down.
Oh, thank you.
Hmm. [chuckles] Oh. [chuckles] [sighs] Can you make me famous?
No! Nate, you don't wanna be famous.
I don't?
No! There'll be photographers all up your bum.
Oh. Yuck.
Yeah, and tabloids going through your rubbish.
I don't want that.
Groupies everywhere?
That's not horrible.
Nate.
Come on. You are who you are because of who you are.
Your intelligence and your talent.
You don't wanna go messing around with fame.
[sighs] I don't know, being famous seems to have some perks though, right?
Famous people get sent so much free shit.
Lot of the time they don't figure out what they want.
I know what I want. A window table at a restaurant.
Is that it?
Well, that plus maybe some of those groupies you mentioned earlier, but-- [chuckles] No, obviously not. That's, um, that's degrading.
I didn't mean to-- Sorry.
Come with me.
Huh?
Come on!
Nathan needs a table at a restaurant.
Whoo, excellent.
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester?
Ooh, L'Atelier Robuchon.
Chiltern Firehouse!
No, er-- Um, it's, uh, A Taste of Athens in T-Tooting.
Did he just say, "Tooting"?
Tooting. It's his parents' favorite place.
Well, it's the place that my dad complains about the least.
Wait, you can't get a table at something called "A Taste of Athens" in Tooting?
No, it's impossible.
All right. Well, there's a simple solution to that.
I'll just buy the restaurant.
[chuckles] Well, you know the saying?
"You buy a man a table, he eats once.
You teach a man how to get a table and he eats at that restaurant until it becomes a Starbucks." Oh, this is silly! Nathan, just be assertive.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Brilliant. Spectacular.
Lovely. Wonderful. It's wonderful.
[chuckles] Perfect.
Sorry, we just-- No.
Mmm.
Oh, my God.
We've got work to do.
Mm-hmm.
I told you, either you take down my photo or you start giving me free kebabs.
7.50, mate.
Fair enough.
No way!
Fancy running into you here, after asking Keeley where you were and scootin' my boot right over, that is.
She told me to expect a mustachioed surprise that would anger me.
I thought it was gonna be Wario or my great-aunt Natalie.
I don't know what makes your aunt Natalie so great, but I appreciate your effusiveness, despite her appearance.
[growls] I'll have what he's having.
Why are you bothering me at my kebab place?
This is like my church.
Oh?
Who knew transubstantiation could happen with a pita? [chuckles] What do you think about joining the coaching staff?
Fuck off.
Mmm, that's a solid negotiation tactic right there.
I don't wanna coach.
I like what I'm doing, and I'm good at it.
People tweet about me, with JIFs and everything.
I know some folks pronounce it "GIFs", but I hear you.
Look, if you enjoy doing the whole pundit thing, then you should do it for the rest of your life.
Why won't you let me be happy?
Here you go, mate.
Thank you.
You two are father and son, right?
What? No.
Mm-mmm. I'm his former coach.
[waiter] Ah, it's all the same thing.
You two remind me of me and my old man when I told him I was leaving medical school a week before graduation.
Ooh, I bet that's a story.
Would have made a great doctor too.
I was really good at it.
Bedside manner, reading charts, cutting up shit.
But it's just not what I was meant to do.
What? I love making a doner kebab.
Anyway, how's that kebab, my friend?
Well, to quote Drizzy, it's the best I ever had.
Good, right? Cool.
Mm-hmm.
Look, Roy, all kibbles and bits aside, I'm really just here to ask you for a favor for an old friend.
One Mr. Isaac McAdoo.
Hmm. He's all up in his head, isn't he?
Yes, he is. And I need him to check out of there by Saturday.
You got any ideas?
Let me finish my kebab and pray on it.
Right there.
For the collection plate.
Later, skater.
Well, this place is ruined now.
Hello, sir. Can I help you?
Uh, yes. Um, Nathan Shelley, party of three.
Let's see, Mr. Shelby.
Yes, Shelby. Sorry, I should have said Shelby.
[imitates buzzer] No. That is not your name.
It's pretty close.
No, no!
Start again, from the top.
[clears throat] May I help you?
Yes, Shelley, party of three.
Ah, yes! Mr. Shelfy.
It's Shelley, and you know it, you dithering kestrel!
Jesus.
No.
Too much.
You don't need to be loud, Nathan. You just need to be commanding.
With all due respect, it's different for me, Miss Welton.
You command every room you walk into.
Oh-- Hardly.
Have you ever been in a room full of football club chairmen?
No.
Every time I walk into one of those meetings, they look at me like some schoolgirl with pigtails.
Oh, you'd look well fit with pigtails.
I do.
But I have a secret: I make myself big.
Before I go into the room, I find somewhere private, I stand up on my tiptoes, put my arms in the air and make myself as big as possible to feel my own power.
[sighs] Like this.
[clears throat] [inhales deeply] [growling] [growling continues] [growling stops] Fuck, you're amazing.
Let's invade France.
It's a bit silly, but it works for me. Find your own thing.
But don't back down, Nathan.
You deserve whatever you want.
Yeah.
What the hell are we gonna do with Roy anyway?
Same thing you do when you cross an elephant with a rhinoceros, hell if I know.
Look, Roy just told me to bring you to this address, ready to play.
I didn't press him for details. You know how he gets.
[scoffs] Fucking crabby, ain't he?
Heck yeah.
Ain't no side-eye like a Roy Kent side-eye.
It's like he's 24-7 hangry.
Mm-hmm, 365.
366 on leap years, baby.
Seriously, do you know where you're going?
Well, no. This is it.
Here, I'll just text him. Let him know we're here.
[cell phone beeps] [phone chimes] [both yell] Yeah, Roy?
McAdoo.
What we doing here? What-- [clears throat] Whoo.
See that block of flats?
What? The shit one?
That's where I grew up.
Oh.
This… This is where I lived.
Where I learned football.
Every fucking day.
And during my career, when I was going through a bad patch, I'd come back here and play.
Oi!
This is Isaac.
These are all the other fucks. You're with them.
You what? You expect me to play with them?
I'm a professional, mate. I'll fucking kill 'em.
[players chattering] We'll see.
What about me? What do I get to do?
Nothing.
Aw, come on. Can I keep score?
Fine.
All right, I'm gonna use my fingers.
It's zero-zero!
Nil-nil.
It is nil-nil.
[sighs] Hello. [clears throat] Uh, Shelley, party of three.
Let's see, Shelley.
No! My name-- Sorry, uh, yes, that's correct.
In fact, that's all our names. That's my dad there and my mum as well.
Yeah, we're all Shelleys.
A gaggle of Shelleys.
Stop blabbing up the young lady.
Your mother's hungry.
Stop it, Lloyd.
Forgive your father, my darling.
He's been wanting this saganaki all week.
Ah.
Mmm, as you may remember, it's their 35th wedding anniversary. Jade.
Of course.
Right this way.
Um… Sorry, uh, if you remember, I requested the window table?
Sorry, we don't take reservations for the window table.
Excuse me one moment.
S-- Uh… [panting] [inhales deeply] You are Nathan fucking Shelley.
[spits] Be right back.
Don't get too comfortable.
Jade, this is a special night for my parents, and the window table is open.
So, here is what I would love to see happen.
You're gonna give us that table, and then my family and I are gonna order a starter, main course, little dessert, a bottle of wine.
And you are going to be stunned by how quickly a gaggle of Shelleys can get through a three-course meal and get out of here.
So what do you say?
Okay.
[whistles] Mum, Dad. [whistles] Perhaps you'd like to give me your number as well?
No, that's okay.
Sorry, I'm picky.
Mmm. Me too. I-- I'm not a dog.
[Nathan] Thank you.
[players chattering] Hey, Roy! Sure you don't wanna play?
You on one leg is better than this fool on two.
Well-- [yells, groans] Ooh.
[player] Take that, you little bitch.
Easy, mate. I think you hurt him. Emotionally. [laughs] What the fuck, Roy? Did you bring me 'round here to get my leg broke?
[Roy] No.
I brought you here to remind you that football is a fucking game that you used to play as a fucking kid.
'Cause it was fun, even when you were getting your fucking legs broken or your fucking feelings hurt.
So, fuck your feelings, fuck your overthinking, fuck all that bullshit, go back out there and have some fucking fun.
All right, game on.
Was that all right?
That was great.
Too many fucks?
I don't know.
Kinda like all the nipples in that movie, Showgirls.
Halfway through, you don't even notice.
You just kinda get sucked into the narrative.
I dated Gina Gershon once.
That makes me happy.
["Song 2" playing] Get off me!
[giggling] Come on.
[player laughs] [Roy claps] [player] All right. Come on!
You gotta be kidding me.
[players] Whoo!
[player 2] Whoo! Come on!
[player 3] Whoo! Whoo!
McAdoodle-doo!
McAdoodle-doo!
[player 4] Come on!
[players shouting, chattering] Nice work tonight, Coach.
Do you really think I'm gonna fall for this shit?
Fall for what?
You're trying to get me to come back to the club and coach.
It won't work.
Roy, I got zero interest-- Excuse me, nil interest in making you do something that ain't in your heart.
So, you're really not playing games?
Maybe a little.
I'm sorry, Roy, but I came here tonight 'cause when you realize you wanna spend the rest of your life coaching with somebody, you want the rest of your life to begin ASAP.
Please stop.
You complete our team.
You're an asshole.
I'm also just a coach, standing in front of a boy, asking him if-- Listen, I'm never coming back to Richmond.
Not now, not ever.
Now fuck off.
As you wish.
[groans] Hey, I'm sorry about that, Coach.
Set your alarm for p. m. instead of a. m.?
Yes, sir, Steve Kerr. Thank you.
Still, you got down here pretty quick.
Yeah, well, I think a fella should only take as long as the tune "Easy Lover" by Phil Collins and Philip Bailey to get dressed in the morning.
Makes sense.
Yeah.
Whoo! It is a beautiful Saturday, and we are playing Sheffield Wednesday.
Aka "The Owls." Hey, how 'bout that?
Hey, you never finished your joke.
What joke?
What does a British owl say?
Oh, right.
Whom. Whom.
Worth the wait.
["L-O-V-E" by Nat King Cole playing] We had season tickets for Richmond.
My family was well-off.
I was a young punk that snuck in every week.
My father wanted us in the best seats in the house.
I sat there because she was there.
My mother and my boyfriend were furious.
They wanted to call security to kick him out.
But she insisted that I should stay.
And we fell in love.
And we fell in love.
Years later, a close friend of the family used the same story line for the film Titanic.
And we've been in litigation ever since.
Together.
Together.
Come on, Richmond!
Richmond!
[chuckles] Mmm.
Just stop with the foreplay.
Tell him you own Richmond and that you're fucking fit.
Coach.
Doctor.
Floor. Ceiling.
Trash can.
Now you go.
I was just checking in. See how you're feeling.
Oh, well, that's mighty nice of you.
How am I feeling?
I don't know, you know?
I-- I'm just dealing with the terror of knowing what this world is about, you know?
Watching a few good friends screaming to let them out.
So, you're feeling under pressure?
♪ Ba ba ba be doo ♪ Well, my door is always open.
Then why even have one?
Heck, Coach Beard could take that thing out for ya Jack Torrance style with eight good whacks.
Five good whacks.
Hmm.
Lumberjack World Championship qualifier, baby!
That man has had many lives, many masters.
Oh, snap! Hottie alert. Look at this guy. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Hot-cha-cha. Oh, ho, ho.
Game day suit. I love it.
Not too much?
What? Too much class? No such thing.
If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.
Hey, I appreciate you checking in, Doc. All right. Let's go, Greyhounds! Whoo!
[Stelling] And we're back.
Let's round off the Premier League with Arsenal heading on the road to Newcastle, where 17-year-old Matthew Kerr will make his debut.
They're calling him the Irish Ronaldo. What can we expect today?
Well, I think we can expect to see a commanding performance from the lad.
Roy, what do you think he'll do today?
I don't know. He's 17.
He'll probably have chips for dinner and a wank before bed.
Oh, apologies for the language.
[sighs] Roy, I was looking for some insight about how he'll play.
I told you, I don't know.
All we do is sit around here and guess what a bunch of little pricks are gonna go and do out there, then we come back at halftime, and we complain 'cause they didn't do exactly what we thought they'd do.
We don't know.
Of course we don't know.
We're not in the locker rooms with them.
We're not on the pitch with them.
We can't look 'em in the eyes and encourage them to be better than they ever thought they were capable of being.
We're just-- We're just on the outside looking in.
Judging them.
[clears throat] Okay, Roy.
Uh, well, here's a look at your old team warming up in an interesting new way.
Hey! [laughing] Whoo.
[all shouting] [both] Whoa, oh.
[all shouting] [George] Look, it's all pretty loosey-goosey, isn't it?
Especially for a team that's at the business end of the relegation zone.
[Kamara] But it's good to see McAdoo with a smile on his face.
He's been a shadow of himself all season.
I wonder what's gotten into him.
Oh, dang. Yeah, come on, now. Come on, man.
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
Pow.
There you go. All right.
Gentleman.
[crowd cheering] [Stelling] Bloody cold out there today. Bet you don't miss that, Roy.
What?
[Stelling] Said, I bet you don't miss the cold, hey, Roy?
I miss all of it.
'Scuse me.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, fellas.
This isn't what I'm meant to do.
["She's a Rainbow" playing] [Stelling] Roy!
Jeff, I have to go.
[music continues] Thank you. Cheers, Ben.
[sighs] [driver chuckles] You're Roy Kent.
No, I'm not.
All right, I am. Take me to Nelson Road.
[driver] No. Headed home.
It's me anniversary, mate, and I haven't bought a present.
Fuck.
Right, my wife loves cash.
[Roy] Cheers.
[driver chuckles] Sorry, mate, this is as far as I can get ya.
I'll tell you the thing Nikki Sixx said in the Mötley Crüe Behind the Music.
"You gotta date your wife." Thanks, Roy.
[crack] [grunts] Fuck!
Fuck. Fuck. [pants] Oi, you see this new watch?
You get me to Nelson Road in ten minutes, it's yours.
Get in.
[exhales] [groans] [squeaks] Cheers.
No!
I've gotta get in there.
Do you have a ticket?
I can't let anyone in without a ticket.
I'm Roy Kent.
He does look like him.
A little.
Around the mouth.
Ah, for fuck's sake.
[pants] I believe you're holding a ticket for Reba McEntire.
[growls] Good to see you back, Reba.
Dad. Dad.
Enjoy the game.
Fuck you.
It is you.
[panting] Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
[music continues] [panting continues] [cracks] [grunts] [crowd cheers] Look!
[crowd cheering] Holy shit.
[crowd chanting] He's here! He's there! He's every fucking where!
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
He's here! Here's there! He's every fucking where!
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
[chanting continues, faint] Hello, Coach.
Really glad you decided to-- Shut up.
Just shut up.
You had me at "Coach." [gasps] [music continues] [whistle blows] [cheering] 
@@@@@@
[crowd cheering] [Arlo] Tartt, edge of the area.
He has options. Chooses Rojas.
Oh, what a goal! Great finish.
[crowd cheering] You have to say, Chris, from where they started the season, this Richmond team is unrecognizable!
What a turnaround for AFC Richmond!
And with that Dani Rojas goal, Richmond are now on a four-game winning streak.
They've certainly turned things around since adding their former captain to the coaching staff, Wrighty?
Absolutely, Seems.
And watching Richmond play, you could definitely see the Roy Kent effect.
And that leads them nicely into Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal clash against Premiership side Tottenham Hotspur.
Yeah, good luck with that.
It kills me to say it, but Tottenham are a top top side.
Unbelievable team.
[Seema] Coming up next, we'll preview the quarterfinal between Bournemouth and Southampton.
Do you want a cup of tea?
[Rebecca] Yes, please.
[snorts] [Rebecca giggles] [man] Sugar?
[Rebecca] No, thank you.
Luca, do you believe in guardian angels?
Are they like Guardians of the Galaxy?
Wait, are you naked in my kitchen?
Wearing a smile.
[Rebecca] Put some clothes on!
Mina the cleaner will be here any second.
Mina. Do you want some tea?
Will there be biscuits with that?
Mother.
Hello, darling.
I've left your father.
Wait, your mum's your cleaner?
No.
He doesn't listen to me. He doesn't respect me.
And Esther Perel says it takes two people to create a pattern but only one to change it.
[sighs] I am that change.
Good for you.
Luca, will you please put some clothes on?
I'll start in the study.
Yes, thank you.
[theme music plays] Hey, Liza. Saw your Instagram post on Sunday.
Way to keep that ice bucket challenge alive.
[chuckles] Morning.
Hey, Derek.
[horn honks] Great morning, Isabelle.
Yes.
Hey, Ted.
Hey, Liam. Hey, tell your mom happy birthday for me.
And whatever gift you end up getting her, let her know it's from both of us, huh?
[laughing] [Ted] Morning. How y'all doing?
Morning.
You're doing great work, Colin. And I love your new mantra.
I'm a strong and capable man. I am not a piece of shit.
You don't need the second part.
Oh, right.
Morning, Colin.
Hey.
Hey, Doc. You get in any trouble last night?
Nothing I care to speak about at work.
Ooh, Doc.
You are more mysterious than David Blaine reading a Sue Grafton novel at Area 51. [chuckles] Well, Ted, make an appointment when you need to talk.
Hey, I talk all the time, Doc.
Just let me follow you around for ten minutes.
After five, you'll want me to hush my butt.
Oh, lookee here.
Morning, Ted.
Hey. I tell you what, I'm shipping the heck out of you two.
[imitates shutter clicking] I'm calling HR.
Yeah, well, tell Mr. Pufnstuf I said hello.
That is a joke for people born in the early to mid '70s.
[Nathan mumbling] And then they just changed the shape of the tortellini… [Coach Beard] Mm-hmm.
[Ted whoops] I don't know about you fellas, but I am fired up for this FA Cup thing.
I mean, come on.
A March Madness tournament in the middle of our season featuring every dang team in the country?
Yes, please. [chuckles] I mean, what we got? Davids versus Goliaths, right?
You know? Rockys versus Apollos. Steve Wiebes against Billy Mitchells.
What's another one, Coach?
Pearl Jam versus Ticketmaster.
Mmm. Classic battle of art versus commerce right there. Yeah.
I got a question for you though.
Has a team not in the Premier League, à la us, ever won the whole chimichanga?
Eight times.
Eight times. Really?
But not for 40 years.
Oh! [chuckles] What have we got here?
Uh-oh. You back into floating office mode, huh?
Oh, yeah. But, uh, it's no bother.
I'm a flaneur by nature.
Mmm. I get that, yeah.
Hey, Coach, what's a flaneur?
[yawns] A wanderer.
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Jane and I got back together.
[Ted] Oh!
[Roy] Great news.
Oh, well, that's nice.
Fantastic.
Look at you guys.
Do you really think that's a good idea?
Oh, shit. Two missed calls from her.
Be right back!
[inhales sharply] I'd like to request an emergency meeting of the Diamond Dogs.
Diamond Dogs, mount up.
Hey, Roy, you wanna sit in with us?
No.
Okay. Yeah, shut that.
[grunts] He looks a little bit-- Oh.
Yeah, you're gonna come in through here. That's fine. I got you.
Just-- Do you wanna-- Dukes of Hazzard style, or as you guys probably call it, "the Earls of Risk." Just go round.
Uh, yeah. Why don't you come legs first?
You wanna-- You wanna jump in?
You'd be in here if you just went round.
Ready? Here he comes. Right-- I'm just gonna stay here.
That's fine. Good idea. Probably best.
All right. Okay, Higgiebottoms, you called this puppy, so start barking.
Well, I'm just not sure that Jane and Beard are very healthy together.
And I'm a little bit disappointed that neither of you backed me up when I just said so.
[whistles] Okay. Calling us out.
I appreciate that and I hear you, but, uh-- I mean, in my defense, I know why I didn't say anything.
And why's that?
'Cause you should never say anything.
And look, man, I learned that the hard way.
One of my best friends growing up was this fella, Marcus Girard.
He dated the same girl from grade school to high school to college, whole time.
And she could be a little bit of a pill, if I'm being honest, you know?
No reason to start lying now.
And, uh, well, I let him know that. I told him so.
And he was not too pleased, all right?
Ah.
That's the last time I ever gave a best man speech.
Hmm. I mean, I-- Yeah-- I try to be outwardly supportive of all relationships due to my dad sabotaging one of my first loves.
[inhales deeply] In year four, he sat me and my classmate, Nadia Shookums, down in the living room and said he thought we could both do better.
Well, she listened to him.
Boy, that's a heaping spoonful of truth soup right there.
[softly] Yeah. I know.
Look, Higgins, I just think it's bad business to get all up in anyone else's business, you know?
Okay, I understand. [gags] So even though this is an unsanctioned meeting because Beard wasn't here, let's just go ahead and Diamond Dogs dismount.
[barking, howling] [howls] Stupid barking means it's over, right?
Yes, sir. Welcome back.
Ay, ay, ay. That was a doozy.
What's wrong?
Jane's roommate flipped out on her.
[Ted] Oh.
Kicked her out of the house.
Oh, no.
So now she's moving in with me.
Oh.
That's good.
That's great news. Congratulations.
[groans] Thanks, guys. [chuckles] [players shouting] [exhales] [players groan] [crashes] [car alarm blares] [Jamie] Chin up, lads.
Come on, Colin. You dolt.
Colin, you're leaning too far back.
Head down, fucking whip it.
I am a strong and capable man.
Thanks, Roy.
Bumbercatch, great pass, but it don't mean shit if they see it coming.
The rest of you in the box, when the shot goes, you fucking follow it in.
Yeah, you smell that, lads? [sniffs] That's the Roy Kent effect.
[players cheering] [chanting] Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
Roy Kent!
[players cheering, laughing] [sighs] Anything for me, coach?
All right, let's go again.
Hey, Roy. You know you're paid to coach the whole team, right?
No, no, that's fine. Just take 4% off my paycheck.
Mm-hmm.
[Rebecca] Ted!
Ted!
You hear that?
Oh. Hey!
Do you have lunch plans?
As a matter of fact, I do, yeah.
Coach Beard and I here are doing Secret Sandwich Switcheroo every other Friday.
What we do is I make a sandwich-- I don't care, Ted.
You're coming to lunch with me and my mother.
Okay. Sounds great.
Spoiler alert. I made you a BLT.
Samesies.
What?
[imitates explosion] Crown and Anchor at 2:00.
Okay.
I look forward to lunching with you, Ted.
Hi, Rebecca's mom.
Hey, fellas. Say hi.
[players] Hi, Rebecca's mum.
Hello, boys.
And the name's not Rebecca's mum, it's Deborah.
I'm a work in progress, a voracious book on tape listener and a staunch believer that if you get dealt lemons in life, then you should make lemon lavender mojitos.
Mum!
[chuckles] Nice to meet you, Deborah.
[chuckles] Boy, I love meeting people's moms.
It's like reading an instruction manual as to why they're nuts.
[shrieks] Let's go!
How's Mrs. Beard doing, by the way?
Full-blown QAnon.
Mmm. Yep.
[Ted] Hey, look alive, Coach. [grunts] Thank you.
[sniffs] No horseradish?
I thought you were allergic?
To horses and radishes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
[knocks] Hi, guys.
Hey.
Oy, Ted. Do you reckon you'd be up for driving us back from lunch?
Sure, I'll give it a shot.
I've got some creative work I wanna do this afternoon and I kinda wanna be a little buzzed for it.
Seems like a great idea all around.
Thank you.
[cell phone buzzes] Oh.
One second here.
Hello?
This is him.
W-- Is he okay?
Okay. [exhales] Okay. I'll-- Well, I mean, that's gonna be a little tricky 'cause I'm at work.
No, I work in London.
Yeah, no, it's a heck of a commute.
Um, tell you what. How about I call my wife-- uh-- his, uh, mom, and then I'll see-- Oh, she's pulling up right now?
Okay, well, there you go. Crisis averted. [chuckles] Okay. All right now. Have fun. Bye.
Everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
No, uh, Henry forgot his lunch today for his field trip.
But, uh, no, Michelle's there. So, yeah, we're all good.
[knocks] Hi, Keeley.
You got to tell Roy he needs to start coaching me.
Oh, wait. You want me to tell Roy Kent what to do?
That's a great idea.
[chuckles] Yeah, he's gonna love that.
Yeah, I'll totally drop it into one of our many conversations where Roy talks to me about his life and asks for my advice. [chuckles] [all laughing] [chuckles, blows raspberry] Philistines!
[mouths word] Philistines.
I'm asking for help here.
Jamie, you and Roy got your own history.
Y'all got to get together and woman up. Hmm?
[scoffs] I think you mean man up, mate.
No, y'all have been manning up for a while. Look where that's got you.
Keeley, you got any advice for this young, half-dressed fella on how to get through to Roy?
I agree.
That's a confusing way to answer that question. Am I wrong?
No, I mean, I agree with Roy.
Just agree with everything that he throws at you.
Really takes the anger wind out of his brat sails.
Shall we?
Yes, ma'am.
All right. Bon voyage.
[Keeley] Bye, Jamie!
I don't really know how to talk to you.
Then it's working.
You're gonna wanna look up "Philistines." You see, there comes a point when you realize life is long, and it's also very short.
And sometimes it's neither.
But it is always what it is, you know?
So, I looked him in the eye and I said, "Paul, I'm leaving you.
I'm gonna live my best life now, for as long as I can, until I die.
Or until I'm murdered." And then I stood up, I flushed the toilet, I pulled up my trousers, and I walked straight out of there.
That's incredible. Inspiring.
Mmm. Yeah.
You should do a TED Talk.
[chuckles] Mm-mmm. No, I agree.
Yeah, 'cause right now you're getting a whole heap of "Ted listen." [Jeremy] Yes!
[Baz] Nah! Rubbish!
[Paul] Come on! [grunting] Come on!
Ugh… And can I just say, as someone that's recently been divorced, the best piece of advice that I received was to leave people well.
Oh, yeah. I completely agree. Yeah.
Mmm. Yeah.
It's slightly different in this case because I'm the one doing the leaving.
And as I understand it, your wife left you?
[inhales sharply] No, that is correct. Big difference there, yeah.
[Jeremy] That's terrible!
[Baz] What is that?
Could you tell them to stop shouting at the football?
What football? They're watching last night's Bake Off.
[Paul groans] Look at that sponge!
That's rubbish!
Temper your chocolate, you twat!
[cell phone ringing] Oh!
I'm sorry, would you excuse me? This is my psychic.
She said she'd call me exactly when I needed her.
That's incredible, isn't it?
Whew.
Yeah.
Wow.
Hello, Tish. This is extraordinary.
Tish.
What a brave thing for a woman of her age to do.
Is she gonna move in with you? [gasps] Oh, you should buy that Pilates machine, and then I can teach her when I come over and use it.
Please. Forget every word she just said. They do this every couple of years.
My dad acts up, then she leaves him.
Then they "move on." Then he buys her some expensive, environmentally conscious gift and they'll be back together in a week.
But, hey-ho, she'll be paying the bill, so do enjoy your free lunch.
Well, I mean, maybe it's different this time, you know?
People can change.
Some can. She can't.
[Jeremy] ♪ Poor little cake ♪ [all] ♪ Soggy bottom ♪ ♪ Poor little cake Soggy bottom ♪ ♪ Poor little cake Soggy bottom ♪ ♪ Poor little cake Soggy bottom… ♪ [laptop: video call ringing] Hey. I was just thinking about you.
What were you thinking?
That if you ever left me again I would throw myself off a cliff.
And I'd lay down at the bottom so you could land on me.
Jane Pain.
[grunts] So, I'm going to Cafe Solo to meet Finn for a coffee.
Mm-hmm. [smacks lips] That's cool.
Um… [inhales deeply] …who's Finn?
Oh, my old uni friend. Um, the underwear model.
Mm-hmm.
He wants to go through some shoot he did.
Um, I'll see you later. Bye!
[video call ends] [Coach Beard inhales deeply] [sighs] [whimpers, breathing deeply] [whimpers] [gags] [whimpering] [Jamie] Big man, Roy Kent.
No.
Come on, man. Why won't you coach me?
Because you don't deserve it.
You're right. I don't deserve it.
And the way you play is dull and conformist.
It's true. I do play in quite a dull and conformisty way.
And you're ugly.
You're an ugly, ugly boy.
With bad hair.
[scoffs] Say it.
I am… Yeah?
I am an ugly, ugly boy… [sighs] …with hair that maybe could be slightly-- With-- With bad hair, fine!
[slaps] Cheers. I enjoyed that.
You fucking arsehole!
Yeah. I know you are, but so are you.
I'm trying to build bridges here.
You couldn't fucking build Jeff Bridges.
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on? What's wrong?
This man refuses to coach me.
He refuses to stop being an arsehole.
Roy, you're not gonna like this.
But right now, Jamie here is being the mature one.
It's true. I'm being super mature, you big, dumb, hairy, baby twat.
He just wants to learn from you.
If you know how to make me better, I want to hear it.
See?
Fine. I'll tell you what's wrong with you.
All right, now. Here we go!
You fucked him up.
Whoa!
Okay. Expound.
You've made him a team player.
You've got him to pass and shit, and in doing so, you've made him average.
'Cause, Jamie, deep down, at your core, you are a prick.
So just be a prick.
We need you to score more goals, and we need you to get in the other teams' fucking heads and drive them up the fucking wall like only you can fucking do.
So I can go back to being a prick?
No. I'm saying sometimes.
When it is appropriate… yes, be a prick.
Okay.
How will I know when?
I'm actually curious about that myself too.
We'll give you a signal.
What signal?
Any specifics we need to look out for?
You'll know it when you see it.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay.
Okay, that's good. All right.
You get that?
He said you'll know it when you see it.
So, um… you know, just keep your eyes peeled and, uh… [muttering] Stupid fuckin' shit.
[chimes] [chuckles] Hello, sausage.
What time are you leaving for the match today?
Three o'clock. Aren't you coming with me?
No. No, no, don't worry.
[chuckles] I'm meeting up with Lavinia and Mary-Alice.
We're going to hear Brené Brown reading from her new book, Enter the Arena, But Bring a Knife.
Hmm. Okay.
[liquid pouring] [sighs] But I was thinking.
When you come home, I'd love to make you your favorite: shepherd's pie with cheesy top.
And then you and I can have a proper chat. How's that sound?
Perfect.
Perfect.
[crowd cheering] [Arlo] AFC Richmond, a club who have never won a major trophy in their history, suddenly find themselves one win away from an unlikely FA Cup semifinal at Wembley Stadium.
[Chris] There's nothing like the FA Cup, Arlo.
These are the games you tell your grandchildren about.
Whoa! Where'd you get that?
Some dodgy geezer outside the stadium. It's not bad, eh?
[Arlo] Their opponents, Tottenham Hotspur, come to Nelson Road in dazzling form.
[players chanting, shouting] I swear, if we actually win this match, I will burn this pub to the ground.
I will… knock over a chair.
I will channel my raging enthusiasm into ways to help my community. [sighs] That's so good.
[Mae] Mm.
All right, here we go.
[fans shouting] Let's go!
[crowd roars] [groaning] [Arlo] We've reached the 30-minute mark, and it's still nil-nil, but it's been a corker of a game so far.
Both sides are in all-out attack mode, Arlo. It's a proper cup tie.
[players shouting] [man shouting] Yes, yes, yes. Come on. Yes, yes, yes.
[crowd groans] [Arlo] Another wayward pass.
And the baffling lack of aggression from Tartt continues.
I reckon it's time for the signal?
Yep.
Yeah, okay.
You didn't by any chance come up with a better one, did you?
No.
All right. Hey, Jamie!
Jamie!
[inhales sharply] Oh.
[pub patrons laughing] [woman] Come on!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yeah.
Well, you don't see that very often, Chris, especially in perfect unison.
We apologize for the fruity sign language.
It seems like Lasso has really settled into our culture.
[Arlo] He certainly has.
Oy, Barnett, here's what's gonna happen, yeah.
You're gonna foul me, and I'm gonna score all the way from back here.
Piss off, Tartt.
[shouting] [crowd cheering] [crowd groans] Hey, referee!
Oh!
[referee blows whistle] [crowd cheering, applauding] [cheering, exclaiming] Okay. All right, here we go.
[cheering continues] Back it up, boys! Come on.
Oy, oy.
What'd I tell you, mate?
[Barnett] You fucking-- Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Thank you!
Send him off!
[Ted] Hmm.
Glad he's on our team, you know.
Hey, what do you think? Trick play?
You know, maybe a Loki's Toboggan or Upside-Down Taxi?
You don't need it.
The little prick's gonna fucking score from there.
No way. [scoffs] [exhaling deeply] [heartbeat thumping] [inhales deeply] It's too far.
[whistle blows] [crowd cheering] Yeah!
[Ted] Are you kidding me?
Yes!
[screaming] [Ted laughing] Hey!
[Roy laughs] Are you kidding me? Nice call!
Yeah! How about that, huh?
[Coach Beard] Roy Kent effect right there. That's what that is.
[Ted] Whoo!
[cheering, shouting] ♪ Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo ♪ ♪ Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo ♪ ♪ Jamie Tartt! ♪ The first half ends with a shocking score that will reverberate throughout English football.
It's Richmond one, Tottenham nil.
Chris, can Richmond hold on?
[Chris] If I were them, I'd just leave the stadium, go off the grid, and just pretend that we won the game until my dying breath.
[gags] Your noise is back.
What's up?
[groans] I feel compelled to tell a friend something he won't want to hear.
[sighs] Is this about Beard and Jane?
I see her sometimes, lurking around the car park.
I mean, she's a bit intense, but she's adorable.
Like a tipsy Reese Witherspoon playing Running Charades.
What's Running Charades?
What's Running Charades?
I have to say something.
Absolutely not.
Higgins, never interfere.
It doesn't help, and you'll only be punished for it.
My parents should've split up years ago.
When she first left him when I was at uni, I congratulated her.
Told her she deserved a better life.
Two weeks later, they were back together, and she didn't speak to me for nine months. [sighs] It does no good.
Well, I think if you care about someone, you have to keep trying.
Maybe one day you'll get through.
You guys talking about Beard and Jane?
[Rebecca grunts] She's quite the jealous type, right?
She once followed me all the way home just to ask if Beard was shagging Ted.
[cheering] [Arlo] Ten minutes to go, and since the amazing goal from Tartt, Spurs have completely marked him out of the game.
Richmond could pull off an incredible upset, but they need to hold their nerve.
[muffled shouting, cheering] [stadium noises fade] [muffled shouting] [inhales sharply, distorted] [muffled shouting continues] [breathing heavily, distorted] [rumbling, distorted] [Jamie's father] You're better than that, Jamie!
[Henry] Jamie Tartt?
[Coach Beard] Coach? You okay?
[normal audio resumes] Uh, yeah, no, I'm-- [gulps] I gotta go. My-- My stomach.
[crowd jeering] What's happening?
He-- He said his stomach.
He can't abandon the game.
Well, we've seen this before.
Lasso appears to be, uh, leaving?
[Chris] I know that run. That's the run of a man who just ate a bad fish pie.
Chris, is there a good fish pie?
[jeering continues] [crowd chanting] Wanker! Wanker!
[Baz] Oy.
Wait, where the fuck's that twat going?
Be kind. He looks poorly.
[players shouting] [Arlo] And Spurs net the equalizer… Fuck!
[Arlo] …with a towering header from Barnett.
Shit!
I'll be right back.
Okay.
[Arlo] The Greyhounds were in disarray, and Spurs took full advantage.
Ah, for fuck's sake, Lasso!
Every time I start to trust ya!
[crowd jeering] Roy, what do you think we should do?
We need a fucking goal.
What do we do? Put on a striker?
Bring on Cockburn, take off Dixon.
[muttering] Park the bus.
[Coach Beard] Or put Sam and go three up front?
I don't-- We gotta be aggressive here, right?
I think we need-- Reynolds, Winchester, Babatunde, you're going in.
Hey! Colin, Dani, Richard, you're coming off.
Me?
Yes, you, Colin.
What's going on?
Park the bus!
What?
Park the bus!
No one up front. Do it.
But we need a goal!
Park the goddamn bus! Go!
Park the bus! Park the bus!
[crowd groans, jeers] [Arlo] And it's a rare triple substitution for Richmond.
Park the bus!
[Jamie] Park the bus!
What's going on?
I got this.
[Chris] Looks like the coaching staff are panicking, Arlo.
This is what a fish pie can do to a team.
Ted?
[Arlo] Stoppage time now, and Richmond are completely dropping back.
They're playing very defensively.
Ted?
[Chris] Richmond going for a draw is a big mistake, Arlo.
You're the underdog. You're at home. You go for the win.
[Arlo] Wait, disaster for Spurs!
Ted?
A slip by Barnett and Richmond are on the counterattack!
Obisanya loops a perfect diagonal ball to Tartt.
He shoots!
Tartt buries it in the back of the net!
[crowd cheering] Richmond, impossibly, are on top!
Oh, Ted.
[door opens] [players cheering, shouting] [Coach Beard] Yes!
[grunting] Hey, boss. Congrats.
[Rebecca] Yeah.
Where's Ted?
[sighs] I don't know.
Uh, a stomach thing. I'll check in on my way home.
Great. Thank you.
Congratulations. [sighs] Congratulations.
It's good to see the Roy Kent effect is alive and well.
Nothing to do with me. That is all Nate.
[chanting] We're Richmond till we die!
We know we are! We're sure we are! We're Richmond till we die! [cheering] [Lloyd] Uh, congratulations on a thrilling win.
Um, yeah, thank you. Thank you very much.
Uh, what happened to Ted?
Uh, I don't know.
Food poisoning or something?
It seemed like a negative strategy to pull everyone into defense when you needed a goal.
Yes, but I knew they needed a goal too.
As long as I made sure they couldn't get through, at some point, human nature, someone would screw up and we could exploit that.
Brilliant!
You said he was a lemon.
Shh!
Impressive by an assistant coach.
Just did what had to be done.
It's not like I'm some kind of "wonder kid." [chuckles] Some kind of what?
"Wonder kid." I think you mean wunderkind. Yeah?
[stammers] Uh, yeah.
Um, can we fix that with editing, or is it-- No, we're live.
Um, well, great job by Nathan Shelley, the wonder kid.
And we wish Ted a speedy recovery.
Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah.
No, thank you. Thank you. Just go.
[Higgins] As someone who cares about you, I'm concerned that you and Jane are… [sighs] Look, let me ask you one question.
You're a great man. Does Jane make you greater?
[Coach Beard grumbles] Okay, look, I-I-I apologize.
[grunts] [Higgins] Okay, okay. That-- [Coach Beard] I hear you. I get it.
We will never speak of this again.
No, no.
See you Monday.
See you Monday. Yep.
[screeches] [screams] [laughs] Oh!
Oh, I missed that scared face.
[chuckles] I missed you too.
[chuckles] How was Finn?
Oh, he's like a Rembrandt.
Beautiful to look at but so dim.
Oh.
Ooh, try this.
Yeah, much better. Yeah.
Yeah?
It's not too Oliver Twist?
Well, it is, but that's kind of my kink, so-- [Coach Beard] "May I have some more?" [players chattering, muffled] [chuckles] Oy, Nate, great fucking work today.
Thanks, Roy.
[bangs] [chattering continues] Dr. Sharon!
We're going for a drink. Will you join us?
Wait, are we even allowed to talk to you at night? If not, I'm so sorry.
For a quarterfinal win, you get me for one drink.
[players cheer] I'll see you after.
[chattering resumes] [Ted on voice mail] Wait for the beep.
You gotta leave your name, you gotta leave your number.
[beep] Hey, Ted, it's me.
I was a bit worried about you today. Hope you're okay.
If you need me, just please do give me a call.
It's just, I'm on my way home for a very difficult conversation with my mother, and I could really do with one of your pep talks.
[inhales sharply] Anyway… take care.
[sighs] [Rebecca] Mum!
Mum!
Mum?
[sighs] "Darling, sorry to miss you. Your father apologized and bought me a new Tesla." [inhales deeply] "I'll take you for a spin in it next time I visit.
PS, shepherd's pie is in the fridge. Needs two minutes in the microwave." [clears throat] [sniffles] Hey, Luca.
Yes, it's an actual phone call.
No, I haven't been arrested.
I just thought you'd like to know that my parents are away.
So we could-- Exactly.
See you soon.

 @@@@@@
Hey, babe.
Hi, babe.
[hums] [yelps] Morning.
Morning.
[exhales sharply] Hey.
Hey.
[engine starts] Bye.
Bye.
[exhales sharply] Oi! You're not going to your office?
Uh, no. I was just gonna go to the café and get a cup of tea first.
Oh, cool.
Can I come?
Yeah, course.
Sweet.
[Lloyd Shelley] That's right.
Make another useless policy you're gonna backtrack on in a week. Idiots.
Talking to the newspapers again, sweetheart?
Mm.
Let me know if they ever talk back.
Hello, hello. Hey, Mom.
Hi, darling.
Got you these. There you go.
[chuckles] Thank you. What's the occasion?
Oh, nothing. You know, just an ordinary day.
[chuckles] [whispers] Hey.
Oh, wow. Look at that.
Oh. [chuckles] That's a good one, that.
[breathes deeply, sighs] [inhales deeply] Hey, Dad.
Nathan.
Would you look at that. [chuckles] They'll let anyone in the newspapers nowadays, won't they?
They say humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking about yourself less.
My little boy wonder.
Uh, yeah, sorry, Mom, but it's Wonder Kid.
Um, wunderkind, actually, is what I think I said.
But I just, um, uh, didn't, um… [theme music plays] Hey, Doc.
Hi, Ted. Come in.
Yeah, okay. I wanted to thank you again for helping me out with that little hiccup the other night.
I'm actually feeling better, so I don't know if this is necessary, really.
Make yourself comfortable.
Okay.
Let me sit. [strains] I can sit here.
It's, uh-- Oh! It's noisy.
[cushions creaking] Yes. Oh-- you know what? Hey, I'll, you know, go on the couch.
Here we go. How about that?
Uh, hey, who am I?
Don Draper, right?
[chuckles] [Ted inhales] Yeah. Isn't that a little formal? Um, oh, I don't wanna put my shoes on there.
You know what? I'll lay down, right? Here we go.
I'll just pop my feet up here. Like this, you know?
Like a couple kids on their top bunk on camp-- I don't know what to do with my arm. It feels… Here. Oh, here we go. This is what we'll do.
We'll go just classic, how you see, like, in New Yorker cartoons.
[chuckles] Right? Oh, know what?
I'll put this under here to help even out my spine.
Then-- Oh, yeah, that feels nice. Okay.
Now, what do I do here? Do I just-- No, that's like… [imitates rushing water, chuckles] Like I'm going down a water slide or something like that. Like a luge.
Uh… [stammers] Here. That's a little too "casket-y," isn't it? Okay.
How about-- Here, let's do this. [clears throat] All right, how's this? This good?
Probably sitting is best.
Oh, sure. That's good. Okay.
All right. [chuckles] Yeah, there we go. Ooh. There you are.
[both chuckling] Quite intimate here, you know? Close. Close quarters.
It's like we're on a episode of The Sopranos, without all the gratuitous violence, which is a good thing.
But a lot less spaghetti and clams too, which is a bad thing.
So… [chuckles] Hey, who's this guy? What's his story?
You good, buddy? Yeah? Okay, good. [chuckles] Very agreeable fella, you know? Just doin' his thing.
You got tissues over there, huh? Hmm.
Yes, tissues.
Yeah. What are those for?
Sometimes it gets a bit emotional in here.
Mm-hmm.
Not always, but sometimes.
Yep, yep, yep.
Sometimes people just sneeze.
Yeah. Yeah, they do. Well, we both agree with you.
Mm.
[chuckles] [inhales deeply] Yeah. Yeah, my hay fever's been pretty good over here.
Must be a low pollen count in the UK, so… [sighs] Okay. All right. Well, when do we start?
We've already started.
Hmm.
We started when you entered in here.
What? Oh, shoot!
Well, I'm sorry. I feel like I've wasted a bunch of time already, with all of the couch shenanigans and noticing your accoutrements.
It's, uh-- Ted.
Yeah?
Don't worry.
[softly] Uh, yeah. No, of course. I'm not worried at all.
Yeah. [chuckles, breathes deeply] Okay. Uh… What-- I mean, what do you wanna talk about?
Why don't you tell me what happened the other night?
Yeah. I don't wanna do this.
[assistant coach] Tres, dos, uno, vamos.
Tres, dos, uno, vamos. Tres, dos, uno, vamos.
[shouting in Spanish] Tres, dos, uno, vamos. Vamos.
[whistle tweets] All right, come on! Come here, come here, come here, come here.
All right, fellas.
Look, there are two things you can't ever let the other team know, all right?
The first one's your home address. Mark my words.
You'll start having food deliveries and SWAT teams showing up 24-7, which is nuts, 'cause in my day, all we had to worry about was crank phone calls.
Then, with the advent of caller ID, that joy got 86'd from the prank menu, which is a darn shame, 'cause the Jerky Boys were a national treasure.
Y'all should give them a google sometime.
But I digress.
The second thing that you don't want your opponent to know is that you're tired.
Okay, look, I know y'all are exhausted. I get it.
But I don't want you to show it.
I don't wanna see y'all walking around with your tired faces, all… [panting] Okay? Just huffing and puffing around the pitch. Uh-uh. No, thank you.
The only face I wanna see from y'all is, what, Coach?
Game face, baby!
Darn tootin', Vladimir Putin. Right.
Y'all feel me?
[all] Yes, Coach!
Good. Okay, good. Now, hop up there.
Okay. Offense, y'all gonna stick around here with Coach Nate and Beard.
Defense, you're coming with me and Roy. On the hop.
Move it!
[chattering] Okay. Right.
Coach Nate, I hope you're not too great to train us now.
[players laughing] Thank you, Dani.
Those drills better be lit. You've got a reputation to keep up.
Yes, very funny. Thank you, Jamie.
Lucky us. We get to be trained by the Wonder Kid himself.
[laughing] Ah, big man.
Oh, very funny, Colin. You a stand-up comic now?
Kind of ironic, 'cause I sat you down at the match the other day.
[laughing] Right. I need all our best goal scorers on the pitch right now. Go.
[players laughing] Colin, Colin. You can sit this one out, okay?
I am a strong and capable man.
I am a strong and capable man.
That's my mantra.
Cool.
Bro, it's been two days. Still nothing?
No.
Ouch, man.
Sometimes three dots appear, but then they go away again.
Mm.
It's over, man. I've messed up.
Don't be negative, amigo. There might be a good reason she hasn't replied.
Yeah, maybe she got hit by a bus.
Hmm.
Or a train?
Mm.
It's more likely she lost interest in the relationship.
Maybe she went back and saw how lame these texts are.
[chuckles] "My favorite film's Ratatouille." [laughing] Hey, listen. Okay.
It doesn't matter. I don't care if she doesn't-- Oh! Oh!
Three dots. Three dots.
[all groan] That's a kick in the plums.
[player] Next time, man.
[groans] Oh, my God. Just answer him. It's been two days.
I don't know what to say.
How about the truth?
"I'd love to meet up, but I'm worried that you can't live up to the fantasy I've created in my head.
So I'm going to let my insecurities keep me from possibly finding my one true love." [chuckles] His favorite film is Ratatouille. That's worrying, right?
Meet him.
[sighs] Who fucking cares what his favorite movie is?
Also, Ratatouille is a goddamn masterpiece.
Ironically, it's about snobbery and how good art can come from anywhere.
Stop your dithering and go fuck your cartoon rat.
All right. Well, what if we meet up and it all goes wrong? Hmm?
I mean, everything always goes wrong. All relationships are a nightmare.
My relationship is the oxygen that gives me life.
Apart from Leslie's marriage, which is a bloody greeting card of some kind.
[Keeley] Hmm.
And you and Roy are just aggravatingly perfect in every way.
Oh, thank you.
I don't know. [breathes deeply] It was definitely easier when we didn't work together.
Hmm.
I just feel like we're around each other all the time.
Wherever I go, he's my shadow. My adorably hairy shadow, but-- [Higgins humming] [scatting] [scatting continues] What's going on?
Why are you jazz scatting?
Ba… Were you talking about me?
Yeah, we were talking about you.
No.
Oh, big whoop. You ready to go?
Yeah.
Answer him.
[groans] Bye.
Bye.
Two, three, four. [scatting] [scatting] [Higgins and Rebecca continue scatting] Hello.
Hello.
You nearly done?
God, no.
To-do list's as long as my arm.
What? This arm?
[kissing] Maybe.
Oi, that's not helping me.
All right. I'll give you your arm back.
Thank you.
I'll take your neck.
[kisses] [groans] Seriously, I have got a lot of work to do.
So if you're gonna be here, you need to go sit quietly on the couch and read your book, yeah?
[growls] [sniffs] Thank you.
That's not helping me either.
What? I'm doing exactly what you said. I'm sitting quietly and reading my book.
You doing exactly what I tell you to do is so fucking hot.
[knocking] Hello, Ted.
What's up, Doc?
I'm surprised you came back.
Yeah, well, I don't quit things.
How are you, Ted?
I'm swell, as well as fine and dandy.
How about you, Doc?
I'm well.
Glad to hear it.
So, is this your first time doing therapy?
No, ma'am. My wife and I did couple's therapy for a little while.
How was that?
Well, let's see.
I'm here in London, and my wife is back in Kansas, which is a good thing 'cause if she heard me referring to her as my wife still, she'd be hopping mad.
How long these little chats you do take?
Sessions typically last 50 minutes.
Hmm, okay. But you charge by the hour, right?
That's correct.
[chuckles] Hmm.
I take it you're not a fan of this kind of work?
No, ma'am.
Why's that, do you think?
You want the truth?
I'm only interested in the truth, Ted.
Hmm.
'Cause I think it's bullshit.
You don't know me. We don't have history.
And yet you just expect me to spill my guts about all the gory details of my life.
The fights, the mistakes, my deep dark secrets.
But you ain't listening 'cause you care about me.
No. No, you're only listening to me 'cause you're paid to listen to me.
You're getting paid to just jot down your little notes and diagnose my tears.
And then what? Probably just blame it on my folks, right?
I mean, you say you're only interested in the truth.
And yet here you are, charging an hourly rate for only 50 minutes of work.
Like I said, it's bullshit.
[sighs] Oh, hey.
Nathan.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Sorry. Ah.
Sorry, Sam.
Ms. Welton. Hi.
Call me Rebecca.
Rebecca. Rebecca, sorry.
[chuckles] These machines, huh?
We've never been so connected, yet never further apart.
Is that what you were gonna say?
Yes. Yes, it was.
Ah. [chuckles] All right. Um-- Have a good day.
Right. Uh, I'll see you later.
You too. Bye.
[chuckles] See you, Sam.
Um… [clicks tongue] Yes.
Hello. [singsongy] Your new pens have arrived.
I'll just leave 'em here.
Yeah, all right.
'Kay.
Sorry. Didn't see you there, Colin.
It's the camouflage. [chuckles] [chuckles] Nate, wonder if I could have a quick word?
Yeah, go for it.
I just wondered-- Well, I was wondering if I'd done anything to annoy you.
[sighs] It's just because I felt like you got angry at me for taking the piss yesterday, but Dani and Jamie did the same thing, and you didn't get mad at them.
Oh, yeah, I can-- Yeah. No, I can explain that.
Um, you see, Jamie and Dani are like Picasso and Gauguin.
Pedophiles?
Artists. They're artists.
And, uh, Colin, you paint too, but, um, your work doesn't end up in museums.
It hangs at-- Well, you're like a painting at a Holiday Inn, you know?
You don't inspire. You don't move people.
You're there. You cover a bloodstain.
You do the job, so… just do the job.
All right?
[sighs] [gasps] Oh, it's you. [chuckles] Hi.
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.
What? Oh, I have. This is just covering up the smell of the boots.
Oh, that's smart.
[chuckles] Then why you in here?
I just needed some space.
Mmm.
I knew you'd be in here.
[sighs] This is the room where Keeley and I decided that smoking doesn't count.
Mmm.
Busted.
I did also need some space.
Space from what?
Roy. He's sitting in my office reading Da Vinci Code.
He keeps muttering on about the Knights Templar.
[whistling] Sorry, I just came to the boot room to get some… boots.
[coughs] Knock yourself out.
Thank you.
Look, I think Roy is the cat's pajamas. I do. You know that.
It's just sometimes I need a moment to myself, you know?
Keeley, stop auditioning your complaints.
Right. Thank you.
Just tell the person who can actually do something about it.
Well, I don't know, boss. Sometimes it's good to bottle things up.
That's how we get, you know, pickles.
And vodka.
Extra virgin olive oil.
And messages.
What?
In bottles.
Oh, right.
Oi, Will, do you think you could take me name off me shirt and then put it back on but bigger?
The fuck?
They're talking about Roy.
What?
Ah, sorry.
Grumpy old twat.
I agree with the grumpy part, but the other two words I take umbrage with.
Roy is none of those things. He's perfect.
And I should know because I spend every minute of every second of every hour of every day with him, all right?
Right, just tell him that you-- Hi, babe.
You talking about me?
[all] Yes.
Definitely.
Ready to go?
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
Adios, muchachos.
How you doing?
[Roy] Hey.
[Roy] The Knights Templar business is fucking with my head.
[Ted] Hmm.
[woman on TV] Because your shit is lying around.
You got more shit lying around than I got.
What? Look at this place! It's loaded with your shit. Just-- Ju-- Just look at this bathroom! Look at all your shit… What's up?
What's up?
What's going on?
I'm just watching Sex and the City.
Ah.
What are you, a crazy bag man?
They're different smells.
Well, enjoy. I'm gonna read.
Cool.
Wait a minute. You use Rogaine? I didn't know you needed-- [Aidan] It's preventative.
Is your hair falling out?
I don't wanna talk about it!
[Carrie narrating] It seems it's not only women who have secret single behavior.
This is my stuff! Don't be going through my stuff.
[Carrie] You were more than happy to go through my stuff.
No way.
[imitates explosion] I don't ''always do'' anything. And I have let you in.
You can't put it down 'cause the chapters are so short.
[Carrie] Oh, shut up.
Shut up?
Yes. Shut up.
[Aidan] You're telling me to shut up?
Oh, my God.
Please, just shut up!
This geezer wears like a spiked belt around his thigh-- Fucking hell, Roy!
What? Do you want me to read it to you?
No. I-- No, I just wanna watch my TV show, and you're rucking ruining it for me! [sighs] Whoa.
I just need some time without you reading or turning me on or just fucking being there all the time!
You don't want me to turn you on?
No! I-- Yes, I do, sometimes. Just not all the time.
Sometimes I need to be by myself.
Wait, is this what you've been talking to everyone about?
Yeah. But you don't care.
I didn't when I thought it was the usual stuff like gossip or how much hair I leave in the drain.
It is a lot of fucking hair.
You've been making out to everyone like I'm following you around like a needy, clingy fucking fridge magnet.
I-- I'm an idiot.
Oh, fuck this!
[door slams] Ah, shit. [sniffs] [pundit 1] And surprise hero of the week, assistant coach Nate Shelley with a heroically ballsy late-in-the-game strategy that put Richmond into the semis.
[pundit 2] We can all agree, the Wonder Kid should be managing his own team.
[pundit 1] Savage instincts, and if I may say, an excellent serve-- Oh-- God. Oh. Wow.
Whew.
It's you. Sorry.
You were rude to Colin.
Not just rude. It was personal and weird.
Um… No, you're absolutely right, um… [swallows] Did you tell Ted?
No. This is just between me and you.
Okay.
Do better.
The door is behind you.
Yeah.
Wait, this is my-- Hi.
I had porridge for breakfast. Thanks for asking.
"Oh, how was it?" That's a great follow-up question, babe.
It was too hot and, honestly, it was too thick, so burnt my tongue on it and I almost choked to death.
Not a good morning so far.
[knocking] Hello, Ted.
I thought you'd be back.
Really? Why's that?
You said you never quit.
Can I be honest with you about something?
What? I got a boogie in my 'stache?
[sighs] No-- I'm kidding. Sorry, go ahead.
I was quite offended by what you said about my profession… that just 'cause a therapist is being paid, they don't actually care.
Let me ask you something. Would you coach for free?
Yeah, I would.
But do you?
No, ma'am.
And yet you care about your players, right?
Yes, ma'am.
Then why would you assume it's not the same for me?
I don't assume that all coaches are macho dickheads.
[chuckles] Ah, it's a good point.
Consider me dunked on.
And look, I'm-- I'm really sorry about that, you know.
Getting all worked up and saying stuff like that, then storming outta here.
It happens.
Self-care can be scary.
Fight or flight is a natural response. You just happened to do both.
Impressive range really.
Yeah, well, watch your back, Glenn Close.
[both chuckle] So you think I'm scared, huh?
Yes, I do.
Yeah.
Maybe I don't wanna learn the truth.
Ted, the truth will set you free.
But first, it'll piss you off.
Well, then maybe your new nickname should be "The Truth." Well, I can't be your mentor without occasionally being your tormentor.
Ooh, I like that.
I knew you would.
Let's get started, shall we?
Yes, ma'am.
That's right, gentlemen. Big deep breaths while you stretch.
You wanna get that sweet O2 all the way down to your prostate.
And, hey, remember to focus on the here and now.
Living in the moment, it's a gift. That's why they call it the present.
[players chuckle] Yes.
Okay, before we get started, Coach Nate, you wanted to say something?
Oh, yes, please. Thank you, Ted.
Have at it, Jessica Rabbit.
Yeah. Oi, uh… [clears throat] …thank you, um-- I just wanted, before we started, just to, um… Well, basically, I just wanted to make an apology.
Uh, Colin, um, yesterday I was a bit of a, uh, you know, uh… Asshole?
Prick?
Cock?
Wounded butterfly.
Yes. I was a cocky, prickish, wounded butterfly's asshole, um… but I-- I really am sorry, and it-- it won't happen again, so… It's all good, boyo.
Oh, all right then. [chuckles] [all] Aw.
That's good.
All right.
[player] Come here.
[Nathan] Okay.
Did I miss something?
[Nathan] Okay. Yeah. All right.
[chattering] Anything I need to address?
[Nathan] Ow!
Well, like I always say, sometimes the best stew is the one you leave sitting on the stove overnight 'cause you fell asleep watching Citizen Kane after too many beers.
[Nathan] I know, Colin. I know.
[Ted] All right, fellas! Hey! So here's the plan today.
Peas and carrots, you're going with Coach Roy.
Rest of you beef chunks are coming with me. Let's go to work.
What?
Starters with Roy, reserves with Coach.
[all] Right.
Oh.
Just say that then. Do you know what I mean?
Here Richard, Richard! Richard!
[grunts] [Roy] Whistle!
Oi! I said, "Whistle!" Roy, why don't you just use an actual whistle?
I told you, my lips are sensitive to impure metals and whistles give me mouth hives.
Jamie, what the fuck were you doing?
Richard loses his man, gets into the box, and you run the other way?
I was pulling my defender out of his path.
He's your teammate.
He needs you to come to the ball and support him.
You all got that?
Um… respectfully, Coach, that ain't what he needs from me.
He needs me to give him space.
What'd you say?
The best thing I can do in that situation is give him space.
He's right, actually.
Yeah, I know. I learned it from Pep.
He got it from "Cruijff".
Pronounced "Cruyff." Okay, Englishman.
Look, whatever. The point is that Richard doesn't need me to crowd him.
And since he's me teammate, I should trust him to do what's best, right?
Fuck!
I didn't say nothing bad this time.
[players chattering] [whistling] Oh! There he is, there he is!
[cheering] Coach Nate, we have a gift for you.
Yeah. Good thing you apologized, otherwise this would be awkward.
[players laugh] [laughing, cheering] "Wonder Kid." I mean, because of you saying that instead of "wunderkind," which is the proper pronunciation.
Wow. [chuckles] It was Will's idea.
[Dani] Hey.
Was it?
Well, you know, it's a pretty awesome nickname, so cheers.
[all] Cheers.
Oh, no, thank you. Um-- I mean, I did say wunderkind, but… Uh… But, Will, this is great. It's really funny.
It's good, man.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"If music be the food of love, play on.
Give me excess of it." If that's your fancy way of asking if I want another one, you guessed right.
[Mae] Thought so.
Bear with me. I'll be out in two seconds. Cheers.
Of all the pub joints.
Trent Crimm of the Independent. To what do I owe the pleasure?
I was just having a bite to eat, you know?
But as we're here, I would love to get an official statement about your early departure from the Spurs match.
An official statement? Oh.
Well, I thought folks knew I had food poisoning.
Ahem.
Not from here.
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah. They do. But, uh, I'd love a personal quote, if possible.
Okay, um, well, I had food poisoning.
And because I respect your readers so much, I'll leave out all the specific nastiness that occurred.
Yeah.
But I'm fit as a fiddle now.
So you had food poisoning and you are fit as a fiddle now… Exactamundo, Dikembe Mutombo.
Love our chats.
Thank you, Mae.
My pleasure, darling.
Oh, shit.
Roy?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you leaving?
What?
No.
[Keeley chuckles] Hey, Siri.
[device chimes] Play the "Roy is sorry for not understanding Keeley" playlist.
["By Your Side" playing on speakers] I stole those roses from your neighbor's garden.
[chuckles] Ripped them to shreds.
And that… that's Phoebe's light, so I'm gonna have to give that back or I'm gonna get it in the neck.
And that, that's a foot scrubber or something.
The woman said it's good if you've got gross feet.
What? You think I've got gross feet?
Babe, I think you're the cat's pajamas, but your feet are a fucking state.
[chuckles] But who am I to judge?
I found so much of my hair down the drain, it looked like a rat had got trapped and fucking drowned.
[softly] Oh, my God.
Now, you are not gonna see or hear me for at least three hours.
Thank you.
[Roy exhales] [music fades] [Will whistles] [whistling continues] ["I Feel Free" playing] [Nathan] If you ever do anything to humiliate me again, I'll make your life a fucking misery.
[music continues] 
@@@@@@
[phone ringing] [ringing] [ringing] [click] [woman] Hello.
Hi, Bridget. Sorry, I'm late.
[Bridget] You know the only thing better than a patient being late is one who doesn't turn up at all.
[chuckles] So where did we leave off?
[Bridget] Uh, let's see. I have it in my notes-- Oh, yeah!
"Ted Lasso is driving me fucking crazy." [Sharon] All right. He refuses to open up.
And when he gets anywhere close to being vulnerable, he fires off a zinger or some obscure reference to something very specific to a 40-year-old white man from middle America.
[Bridget] So he's refusing to be vulnerable, right?
Sounds like someone I know.
Oh, stop it. Me and Coach Lasso are nothing alike.
[Bridget] Sharon, you do the same thing.
He uses humor to deflect, you use your intelligence.
[Sharon] Please.
I do not harness my savantish nature to alienate people and isolate myself.
Okay, I hear that.
[Bridget] I doubt you'll make any headway with Coach Lasso until you let your guard down yourself and meet him halfway.
[Sharon] You're right.
[Bridget] Of course, I'm right! Now, what are you going to do?
["Witness" playing] [bicycle bell rings] Mind your dog!
What?
He hates that sweater.
Up yours!
[song continues] Shit!
[crash] [phone rings] [people clamoring] [man] Call 999. Someone call 999.
[theme music plays] [knocking] Hi, guys.
So, I actually have a fun, new branding opportunity for a coach.
It's only one public appearance. It's decent money.
Would be really good for the club.
Would either one of you want to help me out by being a spokesperson for this-- Right. Fuck you both.
I respect that we didn't have to say a word.
She gets us.
I'm going to be a spokesperson.
[chuckles] Where's Ted?
Uh, he texted. He has some emergency.
Oh. What?
I didn't ask.
Why not?
It's his emergency.
If he wanted him to know, he would have said.
We have an FA Cup semifinal at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.
Who's running training?
Me.
You?
Ted asked. I don't give a shit.
[phone vibrates] Shit, I got to go.
Where you going?
None of your fucking business.
[sighs] Well… Guess that just leaves us two. I mean-- You can run training.
Thank you.
That will be great-- I think-- Yes, thank you. Hold on.
[phone rings] All right, man. Let's go.
Switch it on, boy. Yeah, let's go, let's go.
Good man. All you, mate.
That's it, you got it, you got it, you got it.
Hello, Daddy.
[Sam's father] Sam… Do you know why I'm calling?
Um, no, sir.
I'm calling because Cerithium Oil has just been ordered to stop operating in Nigeria.
Wait, what? Wait, that's incredible!
And you were the butterfly whose wings made this happen.
I'm so proud of you, my son.
Thank you, Dad.
I mean, look, I only did it because you inspired me to.
[chuckles] I appreciate you saying that, because it's absolutely true.
[chuckles] [chuckles] I love you.
I love you too. Okay, bye-bye.
[Colin straining] Oi! What you doing?
[Jamie] Oh, shit.
[gasping] Why didn't you say anything?
It was on my neck.
[Jamie] Yeah. Sorry.
[Isaac] You know what, sod off. I got this.
I haven't found a term I like yet for when I tell people I'm taking a shit.
What do you use?
[sighs] I need to reapply my lip liner.
Men don't know what that means and women understand it requires time and focus.
[phone beeps] [gasps] [gasps] Say fucking yes!
[groans] Guys, guys! Three dots! Three dots, three dots.
[phone beeps] Yes!
[cheering] [chuckles] Whoo! Whoo, yeah!
Wow. Oh, my God.
[Jan] Yes!
Captain.
Yeah, bruv?
I would like to ask you for a haircut.
What?
Ooh… Are you sure, bruv?
Yes, I think I am.
Hmm… All right. After training.
[Colin gagging] [straining] Isaac, Isaac.
Oh, shit!
[gasping] Oh, now hold on, lady.
You're telling me I could shatter every bone in my body, someone could just drop me off in front of any old hospital, dumped into a garbage can or something, and y'all patch me up and I don't have to pay jack squat?
You're damn right.
[whistles] I tell you, I love this country. I love this town.
Oh, did you know that Winnie the Pooh was based on a real bear from the London Zoo?
[sighs] Fuck me.
Oh, no… It's worse than I imagined.
She can walk again! Whoo! It's a miracle!
Oh, thank God for science!
Hey, Doc! The doc going to be okay, Doc?
Yes, her scan seemed fine.
Good. No intracranial hemorrhaging?
No.
Or, uh, subdural hematoma?
No. You seem to know a lot about brain injuries.
Well, I watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy in my early 30s.
And actually, you know, I coached football.
The American kind. You know?
The one with all the concussions and hullabaloo about kneeling and such.
Oh, well, she does have a concussion.
And she's had a couple stitches in her head.
So you'll need to rest for a few days, okay?
Apart from that, your husband can take you home.
Oh, he's not my husband.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ain't no ring on these fingers.
No, we're just friends.
Colleagues.
Uh, friendly colleagues.
I don't have a husband.
Yeah, but not in a sad way.
You know, she's just fiercely independent.
And I'm perfectly capable of taking myself home.
See what I mean?
Uh, I'm sorry, Dr. Fieldstone.
Hospital policy states that head trauma patients, they cannot leave unattended.
Ooh. And there ain't no policy like a hospital policy, 'cause a hospital policy don't stop.
Let me help you out with that, sweetheart.
Here you go. There you go.
Thank you.
Thank you for being here, Coach Kent.
[grunts] My sister's at the hospital. She works in the emergency room.
She can't really pop out 'cause there's always someone coming in with, like, a knife stuck in their eye or a torch stuck up their-- Yeah, okay, I get it. She's busy.
Phoebe, would you mind doing some coloring while I talk to your uncle?
Yes, Ms. Bowen.
Can I start with a quick personal question?
Phoebe's dad-- Oh, he's a piece of shit.
Is he alive?
Sorry, yeah. He's a living piece of shit.
Right.
Well, Coach Kent, we've got a bit of an issue with Phoebe's behavior.
Let's have it.
She's been swearing. A lot.
How bad is it?
Today she called one of her classmates an "apathetic shitfucker." Are they?
Oh, yes.
But that's not the point.
Do you have any idea where she might be getting this from?
Mmm.
Me?
Fuck.
This was her fifth offense. She got warnings, then isolation.
Now I'm afraid she has to go home for the rest of the day.
You know the influence you have on her.
Use it.
Oi!
We're leaving.
[sighs] Sorry for what I said, Ms. Bowen.
Thank you, Phoebe.
[gasps] Uncle Roy, can we get ice cream?
Fuck no!
Sorry.
[clears throat] F-no!
[stammering] Go on, scoot your boot.
Fucking glitter.
By all measures, it's not the cruelest prank ever played, but no one should ever make someone eat a Vaseline sandwich.
But that's Ronnie Fouch for you.
Innovator. [chuckles] How did you know I was in the hospital?
Oh, you left me a bunch of voice notes. Yeah, 32 to be exact.
I thought those deleted themselves.
Yeah, well, I kept all those puppies.
You should listen to some of these. They are a hoot.
Please, no, thank you.
It doesn't matter. I got them right here.
Ted, it's Sharon. I can't come to the phone right now.
But if you want to talk my ear off about some bullshit because you're too afraid to properly emote, leave a message.
Beep!
[chuckles] I didn't mean it.
Come on now. You meant it a little bit.
In concussio veritas, right? Ain't that the saying? [chuckles] Oh, this next one, uh, brings Mr. Stephen Sondheim in the house 'cause it's you singing "Tonight" from West Side Story, but doing both the parts, uh, of Tony and Maria at the same time, which is, well, in a word, thrilling. Here it is.
[Sharon] ♪ Tonight, tonight ♪ Whoo-hoo-hoo! Feel that.
And you do the whole first act. It's incredible.
["La Virgen De La Macarena" playing] [song continues] What is the big deal?
[song stops] [players groan] [stammers] Not now.
My guy, Isaac's an artist with those clippers.
But he only gives you one haircut per season, so you try and save that for a very special occasion.
I'm not using mine until I marry.
Or I get circumcised.
[players] Ah. Quite right.
Bro, I can't believe you're wasting your Isaac cut on a blind date.
Yeah. What if you and this babes only got textual chemistry?
Guys… I believe… [chuckles] …this could be something very special.
[player] Aw.
[clipper buzzing] So do we all just stand here-- [players groan] [Will] Oh, my God!
Shut the fuck up, Jan Maas.
[sighs] Sorry.
[exhales deeply] ["Down by The Riverside" playing] [players groan, chuckle] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
It's like Swan Lake.
[players laugh, cheer] [song continues] Shh!
[song continues] [cheering] [screaming] [laughing] [players] Oh! Yeah!
[song ends] [typing] [players cheering upstairs] [Higgins] Come in!
[typing] Hi.
What's this about?
Oh! I'm just in here until my office exists.
It's really no problem.
If I spill anything, I'm next to everything I need to clean up.
This is very, very sad.
Eh. What can I do for you, Jamie?
Um… Can I get me dad and his two mates on the list for Wembley tickets, please?
Of course! Um, family section? VIP?
Put 'em in the car park for all I care.
Just getting him tickets so he'll get off me back.
Fathers and sons.
So tricky.
They should really write songs about it.
Think they do.
Yeah, I know. I was just-- Anyway… [hums] You, um… Are you close with your dad?
Um, ups and downs, like everyone.
Hmm, it's complicated.
Mine's not complicated. He's just a dick.
Every situation, he does exactly what a dick would do.
Not much you can do with that. Know what I mean?
Well, I try to love my dad for who he is and forgive him for who he isn't.
Look, Jamie. Whatever he may be, he's your father, which makes him a VIP.
[scoffs] Names?
Uh, James Tartt.
Ah!
Uh, his mates are Denbo Cullens and Bug.
"Bug"?
Just Bug. Uh, one G.
Like the animal.
It's his legal name. Changed it.
Because he's small like a bug?
No, 'cause he eats bugs for money.
Right.
[players cheering] Um… Thanks for that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh, open or closed?
Uh, closed.
You get less questions.
All right.
Bye.
Thank you for the ice cream, Uncle Roy.
Oi!
[sniffs] You can't swear, Phoebe.
But you swear all the time.
Yeah.
And it didn't hold me back 'cause I'm a footballer.
No one cares if we swear. It's part of the job. It's encouraged.
But you can't be a doctor, or a teacher, or a-- Veterinarian for wild animals.
Or a veterinarian for wild animals. I still don't get how that works.
You treat them in the woods and no one pays you?
It doesn't matter.
The point is you can't do that if you swear all the time.
Look. You and I spend a lot of time together, and I love every second.
I weren't trained in how to be around a kid.
And sometimes… I get concerned… that I've been infecting you with the worst parts of me.
That's not true.
Uncle Roy, you teach me great things.
I called that boy a name because he's a bully.
And because of you, I stand up to bullies.
And referees.
And I can do that without swearing.
Yeah.
'Cause you are better than me.
I'm as good as the best you.
Maybe we can stop swearing together.
Fuck you.
I can't.
But you can.
[chuckles] Pretty please.
Okay, Uncle Roy.
Good. Now get out of here.
Can you come in for one game of Princess and Dragon?
Can I be the dragon this time?
No.
Fine. But you better have fixed the wand.
All right. Tight squeeze, huh?
Probably a little bit easier when this thing can fold up, I bet.
Thank you for walking me home. I'm good from here.
Well, that's the fifth time you've said that.
I'll just set this puppy down and I'll skedaddle.
Yeah, there you go.
Good spot for it. There you go.
Oh.
Corporate housing, huh?
It does not disappoint, does it?
It don't really do anything. I guess that's part of the idea, ain't it?
What we got back here? Hey.
All right. Home entertainment center.
Well, you know what, I'll just say that it's fine and move on.
It's temporary.
Yeah, well, you know, what isn't, right?
Would you like some tea?
Oh, hell no.
No, I-I mean no, thank you. Sorry, just don't care for that garbage.
I have water and I have wine.
Chicken and the egg, huh? Uh, yeah.
I'll take some water. That'd be great. Thanks.
Tap okay?
Oh, yeah. No, I like my water like Kyrie Irving likes his Earth. Flat.
[water running] Mmm.
So, you gonna get a new bike, or you wanna lay off riding for a bit?
I don't know. I haven't thought about it.
Well, I hope you get back on that horse. And by horse, I mean bicycle.
Although how cool would it be if you started riding a horse to work?
Everybody starts calling you "Dr. Sharon Horsewoman" or-- You know, becomes your hook.
[chuckles] I really should get some rest. [sighs] Hey, 10-4, good buddy. [stammers] Good colleague.
[gulping] [sighs] Delicious as always.
Yeah, all right, no, I'll let you go here, and-- You just give me a holler if you need anything.
You know, you had quite the scare today.
And my job is teaching people how to overcome what happened to me.
I'm fine, thank you.
Goodbye, Coach Lasso.
Yeah, all right now, Doc. Take care.
[breathes deeply] [phone ringing] [Rebecca] Jesus! Hello.
[groans] Why are you picking up right now?
You were supposed to be in there five minutes ago.
Right. I can't go in.
Oh, come on. You've got this. Get in there.
Either it's gonna be the most amazing night or it's gonna be so shit that you can punish me for it for the rest of our friendship.
Hmm. I do like the sound of that.
I'm gonna hang up 'cause you're gonna go, yeah?
You look so beautiful I can't bear it.
[chuckles] [kissing] [kisses] [phone chimes] [sighs] Uh, Ms. Welton. Uh, Rebecca. [chuckles] Ah, Sam!
Hi. [chuckles] Hello.
Well, that's a coincidence. [chuckles] Uh… What's-- What's wrong?
What? Oh, God. Yeah, I'm fi-- I'm just-- I'm, uh, just a little bit, um, nervous 'cause I'm, uh, meeting someone.
Oh, okay, well, I-- [stammers] Don't be nervous, 'cause you look stunning as always.
Thank you, Sam.
Oh, God, don't let me get in the way of-- You have a lovely evening.
Yes. Thank you. You too.
Great haircut.
Oh. Well, thank you. [chuckling] [Rebecca] Yes.
[chuckling] That's just weird.
[chuckling] [Rebecca inhaling deeply] [inhales deeply, clears throat] [phone chimes] Keeley says hi.
Oh, uh… tell her I say hello. [chuckles] Mmm. [chuckles, sighs] [chuckles] [phone chimes] [no audible dialogue] Oh.
Oh, shit!
What?
Shit.
What?
Shit.
What? What? What?
Shit. God, this can't be happening!
But it is. It's-- I knew I shouldn't have come in here.
But you did. You d-- [stammers] No. Sam.
Uh-- We can't-- I'm your boss.
No. No. You are way too young. I mean, you're what, like, 24?
I'm-- I'm 21.
[gasps] Oh, my God. I'm a pedophile.
I feel-- I've groomed you. All these messages. I was grooming you!
You didn't groom me, okay? We didn't know who we were.
[stammers] Okay, but-- but now we do, and this is not happening.
No, this can't happen. And this never happened, okay?
Ooh.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We-- We can-- We can still have-- Sorry. Sorry.
Hello. Hi. Sorry. [clears throat] [sighs deeply] Listen, we can still have dinner. Okay? It doesn't have to be a date.
We-- It can just be a funny coincidence that we both happened to turn up to the same fabulous restaurant, both of us alone… [scoffs] …and hungry.
That can happen.
Right?
["Loving is Easy" playing] I mean, I am quite hungry.
[song continues] [no audible dialogue] [song fades] [female TV host] … to Lust Conquers All Stars.
Our winning couples from previous seasons will put their love to the test.
Will it be last season's winners Ellie and Danthony, or season one's winners… Hello, Coach Lasso.
Hey, Doc. So tonight I'm just gonna keep checking in on you every 20 minutes.
It's standard concussion protocol, but I'm gonna change my voice every time I call you so it stays exciting for you.
[as Kermit the Frog] Have you been feeling dizzy or nauseous?
[chuckles] That's what it sounds like when you laugh.
[clears throat] I'm fine, Coach Lasso.
[in deep voice] Then I'll talk to you in twenty minutes. Sling Blade. Mm-hmm.
Hey, Ted… [in high-pitched voice] Yes.
I was scared today. Really scared.
I love riding my bike. It's my happy place.
And after today, I was worried I'll be too scared to enjoy riding again.
[Ted, normal] I would say that fear's a lot like underwear.
No, I don't want to discuss it. I don't need a pep talk.
Ted, I just wanted to tell you how I was feeling.
Well, I appreciate it. Means a lot.
And I'm glad I did it.
Good luck this weekend.
Okay, A-C-M, I don't know who you are, but I am coming after your A-S-S.
Let's go.
All right. [chuckles] [laughs] [Rebecca] Oh, God. It's a bottomless pit.
[Sam] Oh, I-I commend you.
Usually women use those small handheld purses on dates.
What do they call it?
A clutch.
Clutch.
[chuckles] No, I'd rather dig for dinosaur bones rather than have one of those bags you can't fit your phone in.
There you go.
And this was not a date.
I know.
So, um… can we not do this again sometime?
I'm going in alone.
Okay.
[shouts] [chuckles] No, no. Nev-- never again, Sam.
[sighs] I mean it.
I have to mean it.
Yeah, yeah, of course. You're right.
Besides, we have a big game on Sunday.
Right.
We both need our rest.
Yep.
Good.
Good night.
Thank you.
Oh, bloody hell.
Bloody hell.
[sighs] [Ted] Gentlemen. Focus up.
All right, fellas, I want you to close your eyes.
Look around.
[stammers] You know. I mean, open them up and take it all in.
But remember, this right behind me, just a regular old football pitch.
You take away the stadium and all the stands, I think you'll find it's the same size as our pitch back home on Nelson Road.
Not exactly.
What's that?
It's 500 square yards bigger.
Really? The pitches aren't the same size?
No.
This is the biggest pitch in the country.
Huge advantage for City.
Boy, oh, boy. This sport has the loosiest-goosiest rules of all.
Tough to get my head around sometimes. Okay.
All right. It's bigger. [chuckles] And, uh, look, I know y'all grew up watching games on this field, so you're probably a little nervous.
Shoot, I know I got goose bumps.
I remember being a little kid, sitting in front of the television and watching Queen perform right over there during Live Aid.
No, you didn't.
That was old Wembley.
That field was even bigger.
It doesn't matter.
Point is, guys, we're here now, okay?
At this Wembley.
The one that Freddie Mercury never stepped foot in.
And this is our day to make history.
And I believe we're gonna do just that.
Go ahead, take one more glance, then let's head back in.
We got work to do.
[players chattering] [players chattering] [echoing] Richmond!
[fans cheering] [fans singing "Blue Moon"] [Denbo] City! City!
City!
City!
Yes! Come on!
Look at this. Not bad, is it?
Ah, well, well, well. Hey, these are bang tidy seats these, man.
That's what you get when your son's playing in the semifinals.
It's not for the right fucking team, but what can you do, eh?
Here you are. Get on that, kiddo.
We win this match, we get Richmond tattoos.
Already got one.
Where?
Mind your fucking business.
[Nathan] I'm just not sure how this can… What about if they have the game of their lives?
Oh, yeah. I was hoping for that.
[exhales heavily] [inhales deeply] You good, Coach?
Oh, yeah.
I'm just doing some breathing exercises that Doc taught me, that's all.
Hope it's not stomach problems again.
Tell me you didn't eat the prawn cocktail.
No, never.
[door opens] Uh, guys, it's time.
Here we go. Come on.
Hey, fellas, hold on a sec.
I need to tell you all something.
When I left the match against Tottenham, it-- it wasn't 'cause, uh, you know, my stomach was bothering me.
It was 'cause I had a panic attack.
I've been having them from time to time as of late, and I'm working on it.
But I just want you all to know the truth.
[chuckles] We good?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Of course.
Okay. Okay, all right. All right, let's go get 'em.
Richmond on three.
Wait!
[exhales, gulps] I need to confess something too.
[sighs] Um, I messed up the time zones on our transfer deadline, which is why we didn't sign up that amazing fullback from Brazil.
Oh, my God.
That's okay.
Okay.
Yeah, okay.
[Ted] All good.
[sighs, chuckles] [Coach Beard] Okay.
That's all right. Yeah.
Okay. Here we go.
[sighs] I don't read the scouting reports you guys write.
I've lied every time they've come up.
They're boring, and I won't do it.
I appreciate that.
I-I pretend to get ideas in the moment, but they're just good ideas I've had for months.
I just time them to look spontaneous.
Hmm, it's a good move.
[Nathan] Mm-hmm.
Illusion of the first time.
There was one game this season where I was accidentally on mushrooms.
"Accidentally"?
I'd been at Jane's house, and I drank tea from the wrong pot.
The Port Vale match?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It won't happen again.
[chuckles] Thanks, guys.
[chuckles] Thank you.
Mmm.
All right, let's go kick their butts.
Butts on three.
Works for me. One, two, three.
[all] Butts!
[sighs] You all fancy now, drinking tea, huh?
I didn't know how to tell you.
[fans cheering] Wembley Stadium, the Taj Mahal of English football.
The setting for every young footballer's dreams.
A sporting battlefield, pockmarked with the footprints of giants.
Hoping to add another upset to this fabled ground's storied list, humble AFC Richmond.
Never won a major trophy.
The last London club to make their Wembley debut.
Renewing hostilities against the undisputed greatest team in the land, the mighty Manchester City.
It was only 11 months ago this Richmond side were relegated by City in heartbreaking fashion.
Jamie Tartt was a City player then, and he helped send Richmond down.
Then City sent him down the M40, and he's a Greyhound again.
Come on! Come on!
City are after another trophy. Richmond are after revenge.
It's ready to blow, it's under the arch, it's Wembley Stadium.
It's the FA Cup semifinal, and it starts now.
[whistle blows] ["Blue Moon" playing] [Arlo] Goal Manchester City!
Fuck!
No!
[screaming] How's that not offside?
'Cause he was only passively offside.
I don't get this frigging rule still. That's all right.
We're okay, guys!
[Arlo] It's a corner kick for City.
[Man City players cheer] [Arlo] And a goal!
Fuck!
[Arlo] It's 2-nil.
Oh, 2-nil! Boosh!
Shit!
[Arlo] This free kick could be dangerous.
And it is. It's 3-nil.
They'll be searching for solutions on the Richmond bench.
Defend!
We've got to go three attackers-- No. It's never too late to park the bus.
It is too late.
Guys, one at a time, please.
Okay, don't worry about it. Hey, it's okay.
[Arlo] Can Richmond turn it around in the second half?
Oh, no. It's an own goal. And it's 4-nil.
Come on, boys! You can do better than this!
[Arlo] This is when you start looking for someone to blame.
Hey, ref! Clean the shit out of your eyes, you dickless wonder.
[blows whistle] [Arlo] Oh, no. Never mess with Mike Dean.
Can't say that, mate. I'm sorry.
There you go.
Sorry about that, Mike. We all know you have a penis.
I've been called worse.
All right, here we go! We got it!
[fans booing] [blows whistle] [Arlo] And it's a penalty.
Referee!
What was it?
[Paul] What is that?
[Arlo] And City remove any shred of doubt to the outcome of this match.
[Chris] If this was a fight, they would stop it.
Frankly, Arlo, all fights should be stopped before they even start.
God fucking damn it.
Come on now, Coach. It is what it is.
Yeah. It is what it is.
[fans laughing] [whistles] Hey, Jamie! You can score one now.
Fill your boots! Go on!
[whistle blows] The only nice thing I can say about Richmond today is that Sam Obisanya's hair looks absolutely fantastic.
City move on to play Leicester in the final.
And you can be sure Richmond's disappointment hangs heaviest on the head of a devastated Jamie Tartt.
It's on me arse.
All right. Okay. So… [clears throat] So, Sam, how did it feel to lose that badly out there today?
Um, well, it's tough.
It's tough. I feel sorry that we let the fans down.
There's nothing you can say. It is what it is. It's a write-off.
We start again tomorrow.
Uh, Mr. Tartt.
You have a visitor.
Says he's your father.
[sighs] Yeah.
Are you decent? [laughs] I told ya. Dick.
[chuckles] Oh, gentlemen! Gentlemen! [groans, chuckles] Hey, it's a tough one, lads. It's a tough one, but no shame to it, 'cause, you know, we only ever beat, uh, everybody we play. [laughs] So you pups had no chance.
[gasps] Oh. And there he is, my son.
My own flesh and blood.
Poor Jamie, my son. [breathes heavily] [sniffs] Now, maybe I'm thinking his heart's still in Manchester and that's why he missed that sitter in the first half.
[chuckling] Oh. Whoo!
You absolutely balled it. You balled it.
What were you thinking? [groans] I'm only kidding, hey. [chuckles] Hey, look, do us a favor and get Denbo and Bug past security.
They wanna go on the pitch, take a few snaps, yeah?
I'd rather 'em not.
Yeah, they just want to look around. It'll only take a second. Doosh.
I'd rather 'em not.
[James] What?
What, you're not gonna all go little moody bitch just 'cause you got your arse served to you on a plate, are ya?
Don't speak to me like that.
Huh?
Don't speak to me like that.
Huh?
Don't speak to me like that.
Okay, well, let's see if you can hear this, hmm?
You know that ickle TV show you made?
You made it easier for Manchester City to kick you to the curb.
And look where you are now. [chuckles] Twaddling about with a bunch of amateurs. No offense, no offense.
Huh?
Don't turn your back on me, you pussy.
[Jamie grunts] [groaning] Jesus. God. [panting] [laughs] Oh, yeah. Okay.
You can have that one for free.
[Coach Beard] Time to go.
You wanna go? Let's have it.
Don't you forget where you came from.
[Coach Beard] Watch the door.
[grunts] Oops.
[James] Ah.
["Beware of Darkness" playing] [sobbing] [song continues] [Jamie sniffs] [people on TV chattering] [phone ringing] Hello, Coach Lasso.
Sorry about the loss.
Oh, and thank you for the new bicycle.
It's very kind, but unnecessary.
Coach Lasso?
[breathes shakily] My father killed himself when I was 16.
That happened to me and, uh, to my mom.
[sighs] I'm so sorry, Ted.
And look, I don't know if that's where maybe some of my issues stem from.
No, it definitely is.
Right, tot-- That makes sense.
Do you want to talk about it now?
No. No, not right now. I need to get back inside to the team.
I just wanted you to know.
Okay, thank you for telling me, Ted.
Please call if you need me.
I will.
I will, I'm sorry. I will.
It's okay. Good night, Ted.
[groans] [Coach Beard] Hey, Coach!
[groans] Yeah?
[groans] You good?
Huh?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no-- I just had a quick phone call.
[sighs deeply] That was a rough night, huh? [chuckles] Yeah.
Okay, what do you, uh-- What do you say we make like Schreiber and Liev, huh?
Uh, about that, uh… I don't want to ride back with you guys. I'd rather go shake this off.
Yeah, sure, no. Of course.
You wanna join me?
Well, you know I promised Henry I'd FaceTime him.
They had a recital at his school, and I wanna hear how it went.
[stammers] I'll take a rain check. All right? Yeah.
Hey. Hey, hey, just be careful out there, all right?
Yeah.
Okay.
And don't forget tomorrow.
It's your turn for coffee at the game film.
Yeah.
Bright and early.
Hey, Coach, bird by bird.
Not that kind of bird, but… ["Don't Look Back in Anger" playing] [song continues] [male TV announcer] Earlier, Manchester City routed AFC Richmond in the FA Cup 5-nil with a parade of fantastic goals.
[fans cheering] [Arlo] And Goliath has put David back in his place.
[TV announcer] Here's Sam Obisanya postgame.
[Sam] Uh, well-- well, it's-- it's tough. It's tough, um… I feel sorry that we let the fans down.
We lost. Very badly.
But we tried.
We gave it everything we had, and for me, that is okay because what's worse is not to try at all.
To try is scary, you know, because you can end up losing a lot.
But you have to put your heart out there.
[sighs] Otherwise, what's the point?
Thank you.
[breathes deeply] [phone chimes] [phone chimes] ["Somewhere Only We Know" playing] [groans] Yeah. [sniffs] [groans, sighs] Why did you send me your address?
For next time.
[kissing] [Rebecca] Mmm.
[song continues] 
@@@@@@
[Coach Beard] I don't wanna ride back with you guys. Rather go shake this off.
[Ted] Yeah, sure. No, of course.
Hey. Hey, hey. Just-- Be careful out there, all right?
Yeah? Okay. And don't forget, tomorrow it's your turn for, uh, coffee at the game film, all right?
Yeah.
Bright and early.
Hey, Coach. Bird by bird.
Not that kind of bird.
[stadium crowd chants] [fans] ♪ Blue moon You saw me standing alone ♪ ♪ Without a dream in my heart ♪ ♪ Without a love of my own ♪ [crowd laughs, chattering] [male announcer over PA] Mind the gap.
[female announcer] This is the southbound metropolitan line train to Aldgate.
[male announcer] Doors closing. Stand clear of the doors, please.
[acoustic version of theme music plays] [rain pattering] [theme music ends] [sighs] [crowd chattering, cheering] It was moment after moment like this.
A real David versus Goliath match, but where Goliath just curb-stomped David in the back of the skull like in that Ed Norton movie.
Moonrise Kingdom?
I think that's it, yeah.
[man 2] Yeah. Well, for me, the match was a real Cinderella story.
If her glass slipper broke and sliced her Achilles tendon.
[man 1] Thierry, was this just an off day for the players?
Or do we lay the blame on the coaching staff?
[sighs] [Thierry] 100% coaching staff.
Those are good footballers.
It just felt like Richmond had no plan.
[man] And what about Coach Beard?
What about him, indeed.
Coach Beard knew an aggressive offensive strategy was a mistake.
He should not have let Ted, Nathan and Roy convince him otherwise.
Great point, Thierry. Coach Beard is Ted Lasso's number two.
He's supposed to challenge him, not just be a sniveling lackey.
Look, Gary, the man has no va-va-voom.
Does anything say "sad, single man" more than a chessboard coffee table?
[Thierry chuckles] I know I'm French and expected to say things like this, but I hate Coach Beard.
Shut up, Thierry Henry.
After Richard Montlaur earned himself a red card, things went from bad to worse.
[whistle blows] [Richard shouting in French] [TV turns off] Ted joining you?
No.
Jane coming?
We broke up.
Shocking.
She accused me of being jealous. Me.
Because I told her it's hard to know where I stand, which it is, because she never says "I love you." Did you say it to her?
I did.
And she didn't say it back.
She did not.
Oof.
Thank you for helping me relive that.
Well, you must feel awful.
Reason is powerless in the expression of love.
Nuh-uh. I meant about the match.
What the hell was your thinking behind those tactics?
Mae.
All right. Enjoy your beer.
But come on.
There's no way you thought coming out on the attack was a good idea.
You basically left Zoreaux back there to defend by himself.
[keys jingle, clatter] In a semifinal… A semifinal!
[sighs] [sighs] Oi, Beard. Dropped your keys.
Oh. Thanks.
Rough match, mate.
We thought you needed a hug.
I thought you needed a hug.
Do you wanna talk about it?
We can talk and drink as long as we talk about anything but the game and drink.
Have you ever been to Vegas?
What's Ted like behind closed doors?
How do you cope knowing the universe is infinite but your consciousness can end in a second?
I've been to Vegas many times.
One night is good, two nights is perfect, three is too many.
Ted is a man. Just a man.
And as for the fragility of life, I'm so glad someone finally asked.
Because, yeah, I got a few thoughts.
And so, in conclusion, if this is all indeed a simulation, which everything in my experience suggests that it is, then all we can do is tip our caps to the rascal pulling the strings.
[gasps] [chuckles] [Mae] That's it, people.
Just like my legs after a date with a guy who kept correcting me, we're closed.
You went on a date with Richard?
I think you'll find, Mae, it was two dates.
Out.
Coffee was a date.
Ugh.
[phone dings] [sighs] Where to next?
Bed. This is England, mate. Pubs shut at 11:30.
Well, I'm not ready for the night to end. Any ideas?
What about Bones & Honey?
[scoffs] As if.
Private club, very swanky, impossible to get in.
Hmm.
Yeah, I heard they once turned away Cher.
♪ Would you believe They did such a thing? ♪ [chuckles] Well… Why don't we just head over there and see what happens?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I think there's a dress code.
[clears throat] [gasps] Ah. [chuckles] [chuckles] [Jeremy] Mae, I love you!
Taxi!
[hostess] Welcome back, darling.
Thank you.
Good evening. [gasps] Do we know each other?
I don't think we do, sir. May I see your membership card?
University of Barcelona, class of 2004?
I went to Warwick, 2007.
Oh, sorry, you looked older.
Are you a member here?
Here? No. God, no. Never.
Well, if you're not a member, I'm afraid you can't come in.
This is Bones & Honey.
You are very rude.
What is your name?
My name is Sarah Coombes. What is your name?
None of my business.
[phone rings] [ringing] Bones & Honey, may I help you?
Do you mind?
[sighs] Speak.
[Baz] Hello, uh, this is the fire brigade.
Uh, it's very important that we get in touch with, uh-- [whispers] Sarah Coombes.
Sarah Coombes.
Oh, that's you.
Oh, well, I'm very sorry, madam, but your flat is on fire.
Y-You need to come down here immediately.
Now what?
Act cool.
[whistles] Orion's Belt!
[makes kissing noises] Amazing.
Huh?
We're walking. We're walking.
[elevator bell dings] [sighs] [elevator music plays] You did it.
You did what Cher couldn't do.
Mmm.
I actually feel bad for Sarah Coombes.
Nah. Think how excited she'll be when she realizes that her place didn't actually burn down.
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Sarah Coombes's life.
Her apartment will look more amazing to her than any place any of us have ever lived.
[elevator dings] Here we go.
[chattering] Okay, gentlemen, plan of attack.
What's wrong?
Um.
I don't think we belong here.
Knock that shit off.
We belong.
If you could be anywhere, where would you wanna be?
Here, right?
Then act like it.
Now who wants an overpriced beer?
Who wants an overpriced beer that I'm paying for?
Find us a spot.
And, uh, feel free to strut.
["A Girl Like You" plays through speakers] What can I get you, sir?
Uh, four beers, please.
Would you like them in glass, sir?
No.
Relax, fella. It's just angles.
Maybe if you'd paid attention in trig, you'd do better.
[laughs] Shall we, uh, have a friendly wager on this shot?
Say, 20 quid?
Hold on.
What's trig?
Uh… [chuckles] trigonometry.
Maths. Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry, but where did you guys study?
[in Irish accent] There you are, lads. Ha. Thought I'd lost you.
Then where would I be? Sad and alone. [chuckles] Uh, evening, gents.
I see you've met my protégés.
I'm Professor Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus.
At your service. I assure you, the pleasure is mine.
But, I must tell you, these lads here were the best of the best at Oxford itself.
And now, we're just having a wee liquid reunion, aren't we?
[chuckles] Uh, Oxford?
Yeah, what were you professor of?
Economics and management, till I retired.
At Oxford.
That is correct.
We were at Oxford.
Hmm.
Christ Church.
Which college were you?
Christ Church? [blows raspberry] Our main rivals.
[chuckles] I'm a Merton man, myself.
[chuckles] Merton.
Where'd you live?
Right across from the chapel.
Nothing like waking up every morning to the sound of the Dobson Organ at 8:15, am I right?
You Merton motherfucker.
Ah.
[all laughing] How are you, sir? [chuckles] When did you leave?
Ah, 2015. The year we beat Cambridge in the boat race by six and a half lengths, lest we forget.
I was on that crew. I-I wa-- I was the cox.
Yes, you were, you bastard. Oh! [cackles] [chuckles] Harry Gill is here! Harry Gill, in this pub!
[chuckles] [Paul] Hey!
Marvelous. Marvelous.
Professor McGonagall taught us a lot.
But the main thing he taught us was the value of money.
£20. You're on.
[chuckles] I got it. I got it.
[Paul] I've got five.
Save one for a kebab.
Eccentric geniuses.
Right.
17, 18, 19, 20.
How's that for trigonometry?
[chuckles] We got there.
[sighs] [screaming, laughing] Yes!
[laughs] Fair play!
[Oxford guy 1] Good on you.
[Oxford guy 2] Next round-- next round is on us.
Anything you like.
[Baz] Three big boots of ale?
[chuckles] This guy.
Oi. How'd you know all that stuff about Oxford?
I dated a professor at Oxford. And I listen more than I talk.
I'll be right back.
Oi.
[cheering] [Baz] What a legend you are!
[dance music playing] [people chattering] [woman singing in French] [exhales] Hard to forget a game like that.
You know what will help? Going to see the woman you love.
Exactly. But it's clear to me that Coach Beard doesn't think he's worthy of Jane.
[Thierry] Oh, I know.
Beard's self-esteem is so low, he will need a pep talk to kill himself, and I would like to give that pep talk.
Shut up, Thierry Henry.
[fabric rips] Goddamn fucking shit!
Is there a problem here?
Yeah. This nail on your faux Persian flea market coffee table just tore my pants.
Sir, can I see your membership card, please?
[chuckles] [grunts] My friends are in there.
Goddamn it.
[woman] I'm sure you know that your trousers are ripped.
They're designed that way.
To make it easier for people to kiss my ass.
Be careful. We have decency laws in England.
You'll get arrested.
I wasn't aware the laws were so restrictive here.
Oh, yeah. We're a repressed nation.
One exposed arse can bring down the monarchy itself.
How dare you speak of Prince Andrew that way.
I could fix those for you.
I live over there.
In that pointy building?
No.
Take your trousers off.
You're not in charge of me.
I'll give you something to wear in the meantime.
People come and go from my life. [sighs] I've always kept a pair of their trousers.
This rack is like my memoirs.
These should fit.
Whose were these?
An old lover.
Where's he now?
Dead.
Hmm?
You dropped your keys.
You ever look back on a relationship and regret it had ended?
Been doing it all day.
I've loved every man in my life, but I don't think I regret a single one of those relationships ending.
In all my happiest memories, I'm single.
That troubles me.
Have you ever been in love?
Um… I mean, there's someone in my life now who, uh… maybe it's chemicals or maybe it's pheromones, but… I wanna be with her all the time.
Is that love, or do I just have a problem?
Why can't it be both?
[phone ringing] Could you get that?
It says, "Do not answer." It's a joke.
Oi, babe, I'm here, but I forgot my keys.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Beard.
He's just a trouserless man I met at Bones & Honey.
[man] What the fuck?
Oi, shithead!
I'm gonna punch your fucking teeth out your face and feed 'em to your arsehole like they're candy.
[line beeps] Oh, shit.
You could've warned me.
[scoffs] Don't mind him.
He's just a little jealous.
[banging on door] [man] Open the fucking door. You're a dead man.
Run.
Where the fuck is he?
[footsteps departing] [gasps] Nowhere to go.
[yells] [thud echoes] [gasping, panting] [grunting] [grunts] [sirens wailing in distance] [panting] [man] Oi!
[vehicle approaching] [groans, panting] Still got it!
Whoo. Whoo. Whoo.
Whoo-oo-oo.
Whoo. Whoo-whoo.
Oi, he hasn't tapped in.
[bus brakes squeal] [bus driver over PA] We're not going anywhere until you tap in.
Of course, of course, of course. My pleasure.
[sighs] [chuckles] Excuse me, madam.
Piss off, you fucking scrounger.
[exhales] Good evening, sir.
[chuckles] Are you staying with us tonight?
No. No, I am not.
Ah, well. Have a good evening.
[chuckles] Uh, could I please use the phone?
[chuckles] The hotel phones are just for guests, I'm afraid, sir.
Okay then.
Could I please use your phone?
My personal phone?
Yes, I lost my phone and my wallet, and I'm just trying to get back home.
And what would you be using my personal phone for, sir?
Booking a cab.
Nope. I'm not falling for that.
Oh, I'm not trying to trick you.
Exactly what a trickster would say.
[sighs] I would just go through my own account, you know.
That's how it starts, isn't it? First you book a cab.
Next thing I know, you've geolinked my phone to your network and all of a sudden, you and fake Melania have downloaded all my bank details and you're using my identity to shift more poppy seeds to your own private island.
[chuckles] No. Not tonight.
I've been in this game too long now.
What game?
You won't touch my phone.
Within seconds, you'll have my mother's maiden name, all my cryptocurrencies.
[groans] Not that I have any.
Next thing I know, my hard drive is being confiscated by MI5 for illegal images that you've tricked me into downloading.
Oh, no. You'll not make a fool of me.
Not you. Not a dead ringer for Dame Judi Dench.
Not anyone. Shame on you, sir! Good night.
[men laughing in the distance] [clock ticks] [laughing continues] [empty can clattering] Hello.
[laughing] Hey, I'm sorry to bother you guys.
Just trying to get home and I lost my phone.
You guys are about to save my life.
[laughing] Ah, shit.
Well, look who it isn't. [chuckles] Good to see you again, Mr. Tartt.
Sorry about before. Why don't I let you get back to what you were doing-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. There's no rush.
[chuckles] [chuckles] I tell you what, lads.
Why don't we teach Coach here, in his magic trousers… [all laugh] …exactly what football's all about.
[chuckles] Because it doesn't happen on the pitch.
No.
It happens on the street.
You get me?
Or… [pants] [James] Get him!
Come on!
[Gary] Oh. Well, it looks like Beard's done for, doesn't it?
Gary, part of me thinks Beard really wanted to get beat up tonight.
[Gary] Absolutely, Thierry.
Clearly he'd rather punish himself than accept the love and support of the people around him.
I'm beginning to think Coach Beard hates himself.
Shut up, Thierry Henry.
[grunts] [men laughing] Yeah!
[grunts, chuckles] [grunts] Huh, mate?
[clatters] Punch him again.
Prick!
[yells] You're nothing!
[yells] [grunts] [grunting] [yells] [Coach Beard grunts] [grunts] Gotcha!
[grunts] Stay down!
[panting] Oh, shit.
[panting] [grunts] Oh, shit.
I told you to stay-- Fellas! [panting] How about we call this a draw?
[grunts] Whoa!
[groaning] You had to push it, didn't ya?
Say good night, son.
[grunts] [pipe clatters] [grunts] [pants] [Coach Beard] Ah, man. Come on.
Nothing happened. She was just gonna fix my pants.
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
[grunts] You left these at our flat.
Been trying to find ya.
Oh.
Well, that's nice.
No, I'm sorry I lost my temper.
Mary explained what happened.
The truth is we're having a baby.
Oh.
And it's made me realize how precious she is to me, and the thought that she was cheating on me was just too much.
Uh-huh.
But I also realize that maybe I'm more paranoid than most when it comes to that.
'Cause I used to cheat in the past.
Mmm.
But I've really worked on it.
I'm in a really good place now.
[Coach Beard] Oh, that's great.
[man] Yeah, cheers.
Anyway, I just wanted to give you your stuff back.
Mary says she's keeping your trousers though.
It's kind of her thing.
She said you can keep those.
Thank you.
Well, they look good on you.
I know.
Sorry about the shit game today.
And I'm not even a Richmond fan, but, mamma mia, that was tough to watch.
[sighs] [gasps] Oh.
I think you dropped those.
All right.
You be lucky, yeah?
[Coach Beard] I'm trying.
Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Oh. [gasps] I love you too. I love you too!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No!
[yells] [crying] [yelling] [yelling, crying continues] [car engine roars] [tires squeal] [hip-hop music playing] [window opens] Oi, samurai!

Look, we got a limo!
They were really nice guys in the end.
And so bad at pool.
We told them who we really were, and they still invited us to their country estate for Easter.
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.
We made so much money off them, we treated ourself to a limo! [chuckles] Where to, sir?
Anywhere you want.
This night will never end.
Home, please.
[all] Aw.
Thanks for a wicked night.
You're gonna go to this address and you're gonna tell Renee that Beard said it was okay.
Thanks, guys.

Beard's like the mailman, you know?
He always delivers and he looks great in shorts.
[grunts] Morning, fellas.

Here you go. [sighs] Flat white. Coffee, black. Peppermint latte.
Cheers.
[Ted] Thank you, Coach.
You, um… Everything all right, you know?
Yeah. Just, uh, slept too late. Must've fell off the bed.
Oh, right. Yeah, no. That-- That's a thing.
Okay, who's ready to watch yesterday's match?
No. No.
Uh, I've actually watched it plenty.
Don't think we should. We don't need to.
Hey, now, look. I know, I know, I know.
But this is how we get better, all right?
Fine.
'Cause sometimes, every once in a blue moon, there is a game so awful, so… Dog shit?
Haunting?
A catastrophe of epic proportions.
That the only way to watch it back is at ten times the speed and with the Benny Hill theme music playing under it. Here we go.
["Yakety Sax" playing] [all chuckling] Fucking hell.
[chuckles] [chuckles] [Roy] Fucking hell.
[laughing] [Ted] Okay.
 @@@@@@
[kissing] [both chuckle] The last time I spent this long in bed, was because I strained a hamstring.
[both laugh] Mmm.
[grunts] Should we… tell people about us?
Oh.
I'm enjoying the secrecy.
Sneaking around at work.
Doesn't it feel scandalous and fun?
No. [chuckles] It's so stressful.
Oh.
I'm going gray.
Oh.
I have not seen one gray hair anywhere.
It's not on my head.
Oh.
It's not down there. It's in my armpits. See?
Ah. [chuckles] Problem solved.
You know, if we told people about us… [sighs] …then I could do this… in public.
Oh. You-- You are not gonna let this one go, are you?
No, I am not.
You know, we have the weekend off.
Then I'm in.
Where are we going?
How about Greece?
[shouts] [gasps] Oh, my God, Mother!
Excellent, that's where my spare keys went.
Sam, you remember my mother?
It's a pleasure to formally meet you, Deborah.
I sincerely wish I wasn't in my boxers right now.
Mm-hmm. Boxer briefs.
And like clunky exposition, they leave very little to the imagination.
I am so sorry.
Right, okay, that's all the pleasantries out of the way.
So come on, Mother.
What's my father done this time?
He died.
[theme music plays] So where do you think her father is right now?
In the drawer of a funeral home.
No. I mean, like, spiritually.
In the drawer of a funeral home.
You know, growing up, I used to believe that if you did good things, you went to heaven.
You did bad things, you went to hell.
Nowadays, I know we all just do both. So wherever he is, I hope he's happy.
I like to imagine a heaven where animals are in charge, and humans are the pets.
[Keeley] Mmm.
I'd like to spend eternity curled up in front of a fire at Cindy Clawford's feet.
[Keeley] Mmm.
Yeah.
I'd like to be reincarnated as a tiger… and then ravage anyone who looked at me wrong.
[Keeley chuckles] [inhales] You know, if you weigh a person's body right after death, it's 21.3 grams lighter, and some say that's the weight of the soul.
Mm-hmm.
[Keeley] Wow.
Whoever figured that out clearly weighed someone, murdered them, then weighed them again.
You live, you die, you're done.
Good night.
Hmm.
He's on his period.
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oi, so we're all going to this funeral as a team.
So that means ties, shirts… [scoffs] …and no trainers.
[players groan] What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Okay.
Well, what if they're, like, really nice Yeezys?
Yeah.
What color?
Bright red.
Okay, I'll wear some dress shoes.
Where do you get dress shoes?
I don't have time to stand in line at midnight and wait till morning to buy new shoes.
You don't have to do that for shoes like these, mate.
Nobody wants them.
["Never Gonna Give You Up" starts] [song continues, muffled] Oh, my God! This fucking song!
Mother, turn it off!
[Deborah] Hang on! Hang on, sausage.
I can't hear you.
[song stops] Oh, of course you can't fucking hear me.
What did you want?
Why are you playing that song?
Oh, I'm sorry. I like to have it playing in every room in the house when I wake up.
It just makes me feel happy.
Well, you shouldn't feel happy today.
You should feel happy every day, Rebecca.
[sighs] Do you want to talk about that?
No-- I am happy.
I-- I don't need to talk about anything.
You know, the old Rebecca used to love that song.
Yeah, well, the whole world used to love that song.
Then we heard it ad nauseam, and now we're over it.
Well, I don't work that way.
Once I love something, I love it forever.
[sighs] You know, you can change this room to whatever you want.
You don't need to keep it like this for me.
No, it reminds me of when we were close.
I want it that way.
Now I know what song I want to play next.
Oh, no!
[Sassy] Good morning, Stinky.
Oh! [chuckles] [laughs] What the hell are you thinking?
Ah, just wanted to see if I could still do it.
Those Tracy Anderson workouts are having the right effect.
[Rebecca laughs] Nora, hurry up!
[Nora] I'm taking my time and being careful.
When I was your age, I could do this in seconds.
[yawns] That's true.
While drunk, by the way.
Florence, darling, it's been ages.
Deborah. Oh.
Thank you for coming.
Nora and I are here for anything you need, okay?
Isn't that right, Nora?
[Nora screams] [thumps] Nora!
Oh, God.
[chuckles] I'm okay.
[chuckles] Funerals are weird, aren't they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're like a party, but for sad people.
Like where everyone knows they have to go and be sad.
Maybe you're not sad, but you have to go and be sad.
I think that's weird.
Yeah, they're horrible.
Roy, if you die, do you want to be buried or cremated?
Like, if you were hit by a bus today, what do I do?
Go after the bus driver and make him pay for what he did to me.
Avenge me, Keeley.
Avenge me!
This funeral is really messing with your head, innit?
I found this company, and they bury you in a biodegradable sack.
So when your body decomposes, it fertilizes the seeds of a fruit tree.
That's what I want.
Because then you and all the people that love me can eat the fruit from my tree.
That is fucking mental.
Coming from the guy that wants me to ruin a bus driver's life just 'cause he killed you swerving to avoid a child.
I didn't know about the fucking child.
I just like the idea that my death can nourish people.
With fruit made from your rotting corpse?
I wouldn't eat that.
But you'll eat a kebab that you find a hair in?
It's fine if you know who the hair is from.
That's part of the deal. He's a lovely bloke.
You're not really angry, are you?
Yes, I actually am.
And now we have to go to a funeral and act sad.
Well, now I am sad.
["Easy Lover" playing] [music fades] [breathing shakily] Shit.
[ears ringing] [gasping] We're so sorry for your loss.
[somber organ music plays] Oh, my goodness. I can't believe you made it.
Of course.
Dad always loved you both.
Who are they?
I've no idea.
Mmm.
[Rupert] My darling, Deborah.
Rupert.
My sincerest condolences.
Aw.
Didn't think you were coming.
Rebecca, Paul was family.
No, I mean because you weren't invited.
It's lovely to see you, Rupie.
And introducing Diane.
Aw, what a chubby baby.
[baby crying] Congratulations, Mother. You've just fat-shamed a baby to tears.
Aw, come here.
[kisses] Aw.
[crying stops] Oh.
Et voilà, the magic touch.
Oh, it's not magic.
I ate the placenta raw, [in baby voice] and she knows it.
[babbles] Yeah, I had all the TVs in the house removed.
I just sit around and watch them all day.
How lovely.
Excuse me.
[bus approaches] [bus brakes hiss] My condolences.
Thank you, Leslie.
[player] Sorry, Ms. Welton.
[Rebecca] Aw.
[player 2] Sorry for your loss.
How many of them came?
All of them.
And none of them are wearing trainers.
Mm, that's how much they care about you.
[sighs] My feet are killing me, man.
We'll sit down in a minute, mate.
[Dani speaks indistinctly] [Jamie] Deep breaths, mate.
Rebecca.
Sam.
And Colin, and Isaac, and Nathan.
Everyone. Thank you all so much for coming.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Yeah, sorry for your loss.
Yes, um-- [clicks tongue] Uh, fathers are the training wheels on the bikes of… [stammers] Um… Sorry-- I just didn't want to say what they said, so I, um-- Sorry for your loss.
[clicks tongue] [clicks tongue] Sassy.
Oh, decrepit shitbag.
Oh, come on, Sass. Let's let bygones be bygones, eh?
I've got a daughter now. I've changed.
Oh, right.
Having a daughter erases all the shitty things you've done to women in your lifetime.
Cool.
Rupert, I think about your death every single day.
Oh, I can't wait.
I'm gonna wear red to your funeral.
I will be a beacon of joy to the other three people there.
[chuckles] Always a pleasure, Sassy.
Fuck off and die, Rupert.
[ringing] Good morning, Ted.
Okay.
Ted, you're-- Ted, you're okay.
Just breathe.
Just focus on your 4-7-8 breathing.
You can. Come on. Just breathe.
I'm on my way.
[no audible dialogue] That baby sucks.
[sighs] You don't have to say that for me.
I'm not just saying it. I'm serious.
That baby's whack. I hate it.
I love you.
I love you too.
I'm here for you, whatever you need.
I know.
I won't leave your side.
Jones!
Sassy! Oh, my God!
[chuckles, screams] [Sassy chuckles] [Keeley] Hi!
I'm used to it.
Sorry for your loss.
[sighs] [shouts] You look amazing!
Good to see you. [chuckles] Thank you.
You're fine. Keep walking.
[scoffs] God.
I guess we're supposed to be sad.
Yeah, yeah.
Funerals are so weird.
I was literally talking about that earlier.
Do you also wanna be a tree when you die?
Hell yeah.
Or a really stupid dog.
Ooh.
Either one is a great life.
Yeah.
So where's Ted?
[chuckles] Sassy and Ted, sitting in a tree.
Oh, God.
F-U-C-K-I-N-G.
Shut up, you little troll.
I'm sorry. I say mean things to beautiful women.
Aw. Thanks, Sass.
[gasps] By the way, record scratch, but I think Rebecca is secretly dating someone.
What?
For, like, weeks.
[gasps] Now, is today an inappropriate day to inquire/badger her into telling us who?
We'll never know unless we try.
[chuckles] Keeley.
Jamie.
Wow, nice suit.
All of you. Look at you. [chuckles] Look. Hey. Come here.
Is this, um-- Is this the suit that Ted got you?
What, this?
Yeah. Mmm.
Um, I can't remember-- Uh, yes. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's-- Yeah.
Nice, it's really nice.
Thank you.
Another man buying you clothes is infantilizing, yes?
Whoa.
Fuck's sake.
Well, no. He doesn't buy all of my clothes.
Most of them are gifts from my mum. You know.
Aw.
Let's go.
[apple crunches] Is that a fucking apple?
Yeah.
I got it from a tree outside.
Tastes like dead people.
That's not funny, Roy.
No, but it's surprisingly delicious.
Cheer up, Keeley. It's a funeral.
[speaking Spanish] [breathes shakily] I hate dress shoes so much, Jamie.
I know, muchacho.
'Cause remember, they ain't made for people like us.
They're made for sheep.
They're made for Muggles.
They're made for twats.
When I get home, I will set them on fire, and their memory will burn in hell.
Jesus, Dani.
Jesús has no place in the conversation of these damn shoes.
[groans, prays in Spanish] [doorbell rings] [lock buzzes] How you feeling, Ted?
I'm better, you know?
Not great, but better.
Good.
Because when someone's not great, that allows me to get in there and do my thing.
[chuckles] Yeah.
May I sit down?
I wish the doctor would, yeah.
You want something to drink? A cup of tea or something?
No, thank you. I hate tea.
Tastes like a wet paper bag.
I'll tell you anything.
I don't think I've ever been in a properly… Anglican house of worship before, and… it makes me miss you, and I-- I just wish you were here.
Me too. I love funerals.
Is it an open casket?
God, I hope so. I like to see.
[chuckles] Me too.
[breathes deeply] Yeah, yeah. You know what?
[Keeley, Rebecca laughing] [Rebecca] You can't be serious.
[Keeley] I'm dead serious!
[groans] What? I mean it.
When I was a kid, the only thing I liked about church was confession.
It was so freeing.
I'd just sit there and admit all the sickest shit inside of my brain.
[chuckles] Oh, my God. One time, I made the priest blush and barf at the same time.
Yeah.
[knocking] I have been told to come in and ask you to lower your voices.
Oh.
Oh.
But I also brought this.
[Rebecca gasps] Oh, good work.
Oh, nice. [chuckles] Stole it from a little boy in a white robe.
No, Sass.
[Keeley chuckles] So, Stinky.
[Rebecca] Mmm?
Who are you secretly shagging?
What?
Oh, let's skip the part where you pretend you're not, yeah?
Oh, what are you even talking about? Hmm?
Um, how about the bullshit text after the date, the fact I have not seen you outside of work for two weeks, and that even though today is your father's funeral, you are glowing like a girl that just got properly plowed.
[laughs] God.
Shit.
[gasps, screaming] [Keeley] I knew it! I knew it!
Oh, my God! You're right! [screams] I've been asked to come in and tell you to lower your voices.
The vicar looked like he wanted to swear.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, of course.
We're just trying to figure out who Rebecca is shagging.
Oh, I know.
And it's good.
Mother.
[screams] Come on-- Hang on. Hang on.
[Keeley shouts] Okay, let's play 20 questions.
Yes! Yes.
[laughs] Oh, my-- This is thrilling.
Uh, is he tall?
Yes.
Is it Sam?
How the fuck did you know that?
[all screaming] Oh, my God! I fucking did!
No!
[Nora screaming indistinctly] [groans] Excuse me for one moment, please.
[Keeley, Sassy screaming] What?
I did!
[Sassy screams] Oh, my God!
[indistinct yelling] That's it!
Oh, my Go-- Everyone out except immediate family, please.
[whispers] You're so bad.
[chuckles] [mouthing words] Sorry.
Boss-ass bitch.
[Rebecca chuckles] Oh. Forgive me, Father.
S-Sorry, it's terrible behavior.
[chuckles] Ted, it's not surprising that you had a panic attack.
It's possible that going to this funeral would trigger memories of going to your own father's funeral.
[groans] Nope. Nope, nope.
I didn't go to my dad's funeral.
Okay, why not?
'Cause he quit.
You know, he quit on his family.
He quit on himself.
[clicks tongue] And I hated him for that.
I think I still hate him for it.
I think you do too, Ted.
And that's okay.
What happened with your father is a difficult thing for anyone to make sense of, especially his teenage son.
Do you agree?
Yeah, okay.
Okay, good.
Why don't you share with me what happened?
Um… [chuckles] [breathes deeply] Do you know what you're going to say in your eulogy?
I don't want to do a eulogy.
Rebecca.
It would look awful if you didn't say anything at your own father's funeral.
I don't care.
I've got nothing nice to say.
What's got into you?
He was a good father, a wonderful husband.
Oh, was he?
What are you so angry about?
[scoffs] I don't want to talk about it. Not today.
Oh, stop behaving like a child.
Fine, you really want to know?
Because I am so sick of keeping secrets.
Dad cheated on you, and I saw it.
When you were away, and I was meant to be staying the night with Sassy.
I even remember the date. It was Friday the 13th, 199-- …one, in September.
I remember the date 'cause me and a bunch of high school buddies were gonna do a marathon of all them Jason movies that night.
So I, you know, came home from school as usual and, uh, went up to my room to… …nick a bottle of wine from your drinks cabinet, and as we opened the door, I-- I heard-- Bang!
So we went to investigate.
I opened up the door, and… there he was.
In all his glory with his arse in the air with Mrs. Reynolds screaming his name.
And Sassy didn't say anything for the first time in her life, and I just-- Screamed and choked. Cried.
And he came running after me in his dressing gown, begging me to stop, but I just-- Ran upstairs, called 911.
Went to the fridge, grabbed one of his Coors Lights.
Drank that.
Then I called my mom at work and let her know she needed to come home.
And the next day, when I came back, he said nothing about it.
And that is why I'm so fucking angry, okay?
It's why I've always hated him.
And I still hate him.
I know.
[scoffs] No, you don't know how I feel.
I mean, I know about his cheating.
All of it.
You knew, and you did nothing?
Of course I knew. I know everything.
Then I hate you too.
I hate you for letting him treat you like that.
I'm sorry that happened to you, Ted.
Yeah, me too.
And I understand why you're angry with him.
[Sharon sighs] He took a lot away from you.
And my mom.
And your mum, yes.
I'm curious about something.
Mm-hmm?
What was he like?
He was a good man, you know.
Real chatterbox, believe it or not.
Probably could have been a little bit better listening box at times.
[chuckles] What did you love about him?
Why?
You told me what you hate about him.
I'd love to hear something you remember that made you feel good.
[chuckles] When I was in fifth or sixth grade, there was this book called Johnny Tremain, and our homework for, like, a month was to read this book.
At the end of the month, I hadn't read a lick of it, you know.
[Ted chuckles] And we had a test, big test, like, the next day.
And the night before, I was anxious as all heck, and I couldn't sleep, and my dad starts getting after me about that.
And I start crying.
And he's like, "Whoa, buddy. What's wrong? What's wrong?" And I tell him what's up.
And he says, "Hey, don't worry about it, okay.
Just go up to your room, lay your head on your pillow and think about something you're looking forward to." So that's what I did.
Next morning, I wake up, and he says, "Hey, you ain't gonna ride your bike to school. I'm gonna drive you." And I'm like, "All right." And on the way to school, he talks me through the entire book, like it's a, uh, a bedtime story or something.
'Cause he stayed up all night, the whole night, reading the whole damn thing, 'cause he didn't want his little boy stressed out over some stupid, silly test.
[chuckles] And I ended up getting an A.
Boom.
[both chuckle] He was a good dad.
And I don't think he knew that.
I think if he would've known how good he was at stuff he didn't really care about being good at, he-- I don't think he would've done what he-- And I wish I would've told him.
I wish I would've told him more.
[sobs] I was just so angry at him.
[voice cracks] 'Cause he was always going to work and just out with friends or something like that, and then he was gone.
[sobs] And I knew right then and there that I was never gonna let anybody get by me without understanding they might be hurting inside, you know.
'Cause life, it's hard.
It's real hard.
[sobs, sighs] Thank you, Ted.
I don't know if this is illegal or something, but can I have a hug?
Oh, sure.
[sobbing] It's okay.
[Ted exhales] Are you going to charge me for this session?
Of course I am.
Mmm. Okay.
For the house call.
I appreciate your integrity.
Mmm. You're welcome.
[sighs] I'm sorry, Rebecca, but-- I'm not as strong as you.
I was too scared to leave him for good.
[scoffs] You don't think I was scared leaving Rupert?
I was terrified.
And rightly so because let me tell you, being alone is fucking horrible.
But it's been necessary.
'Cause it's actually started to feel rather wonderful.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[Rebecca sighs] Besides, Rupert was a self-righteous shit.
Then why are you always so nice to him?
Because, my darling, the best way to deal with people like that is to make sure they know they can't get to you.
Anyway, when all's said and done, what's more important, being loving or being right?
I was so proud of you when you left him.
You knew you deserved better.
Now, I've got a whole lot of baggage, but when I love something, I love it forever.
And I loved your father.
Even though he treated you like that?
Yeah.
[Rebecca sighs] He wasn't perfect. I didn't need him to be.
He always came back.
You know, I'm actually glad to hear that you hate me.
All these years, I've thought you didn't feel anything for me.
I'll take your anger over your indifference any day.
[sniffles] [knocks on door] It's time.
[sighs] And thank you for keeping your voices down.
[sighs] Come on, then.
[crowd murmuring] [speaking indistinctly] Let us pray.
Our Father… [all] …who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ "The Lord is my shepherd.

Now, normally I would have to fib about how well I knew the deceased.
But in this case, I did know Paul very well.
He came to church every weekend, sitting right over there, paying attention to every single word of the Richmond match he was listening to on his phone.
[crowd laughs] [priest] But I never felt the need… [Dani] …mother of Jesus Christ.
[priest] …to chide Paul about this.
It was a sign of his passion… [whispers] Oh, my God.
…for his beloved sport and the commitment he showed to his team.
They're the same passion and commitment which he showed both as a husband and a father to his family as well.
And now we will hear a eulogy from Paul's daughter, Rebecca.
[mouthing words] I don't really know what to say.
Um… [door clatters] [crowd murmuring] [Rebecca clears throat] Um… [clears throat] Um, my father… was, um… We're no strangers to love.

Rupert, thank you so much for coming.
Dad would've loved you being here.
Do you want to pop by at the house, Rupie?
We're having some people over, and I know Rebecca would hate me if I didn't invite you.
Uh-- [chuckles] Thank you, both, uh-- Uh, well... [stammers] I'm afraid we have to go.
[Deborah] Aw.
It's nap time.
For you or the baby? Boom!
Ooh!
[both chuckling] Yeah, for mother and child, actually.
Yeah, she won't sleep in the crib unless I'm in there with her.
Oh, won't she?
[Sassy] Oh! So sweet.
Take care.
[chuckles] Oh, uh, Rebecca, I meant to say.
Um, I've convinced Bex to give up her shares in Richmond.
I mean, there's just no time for footie these days.
[chuckles] So, um, we'd love you to have them.
Like a funeral present?
Hmm.
I think that's very thoughtful of you, Rupie.
Yes, yes. Thank you so much, Rupert.
[Rupert] Mmm.
[chuckles] [no audible dialogue] [reception guests chattering] [Keeley] Yeah, you're right.
[Sassy] Yes.
I think I need to break it off with Sam.
What?
Why?
It's not the age thing, right?
No. I'm-- I'm not even sure I-- Wait, are you worried about press stuff?
[sighs] Maybe.
[gasps] I know.
Penis is too big.
Hurts your tiny little vagina.
[all chuckling] Yes, that's it.
…make sure they got air in 'em.
Speaking of which.
Oh, hey.
[Sassy] Hi.
Uh, me and Billy were just going over here… Okay.
…to talk about 1966.
[Billy speaks indistinctly] How you doing?
Oh, there he is. [sighs] Right, wish me luck.
You got this.
Mmm.
It'll be all right.
Be gentle though, yeah?
Oh.
Oh, God, he's smiling. I hate to see him like this.
Rebecca, muchísimas gracias. I can feel my toes again.
I am so happy we wear the same size.
Good. Me too.
You keep those.
Your generosity knows no boundaries.
[speaks Spanish] Hi, Jamie. Do you want a drink?
Don't really know where to start, to be honest.
I'm a bit all over the place.
You wanna start with a beer?
Uh, no, thank you. Um, listen, Keeley.
I know that you're with Roy and that you're happy, but today's made me realize that I'd hate myself if I didn't say… [inhales] …I didn't just come back to Richmond to get away from my dad.
I also came back 'cause of you.
I finally think that I'm becoming the best version of myself, the kind of man that you always knew that I could be.
[chuckles] And I know that this is a mad, shitty thing to do, but… I love you, Keeley.
Sorry.
Oi.
[gasps] Listen, I was a prick today, making dumb fucking jokes.
It's, just, death makes me uncomfortable 'cause when my granddad died, I spent every single night for a whole year praying that I could just talk to him just once, or see him just one more time like he was Obi-Wan Kenobi or some shit.
And I got fuck all.
But it did make me realize, we only got this one life… and I don't wanna waste a second of it.
I love you, Keeley.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.
Sorry.
[sighs] I've wanted to do this all day, but I haven't had the chance.
[sighs] Sam, you're so kind and loving and… wise.
But-- Oh, no.
I hate big buts, and I cannot lie.
There's just this one issue that-- [guests chattering] [whispers] There's just one thing I can't get past.
What is it?
You're wonderful.
Why is that a bad thing?
Because you could really hurt me.
But you can hurt me too.
Well, doesn't that scare you?
No.
Does it scare you?
Yes.
And I-- I think I need to figure out why.
On my own.
[Sam sighs] Uh… I understand.
Take as long as you need.
[breathes deeply] It's okay.
Thank you.
But, Rebecca, there's something I should warn you of.
Yes?
I'm only gonna get more wonderful.
I know.
[both chuckle] Food was amazing. Thank you very much.
Thank you for coming, Thierry.
Yeah.
Bye, Isaac.
Thanks, Isaac.
Ladies.
Sorry for your loss, ladies.
Oh, don't be, Ted.
You didn't kill him, did you?
Mum.
Well, I'm sorry that I was late today. How about that? [chuckles] Yeah, is everything okay?
Everything? Heck, no. No.
But me? Yeah, I'm doing okay.
Okay.
Yeah. [chuckles] Uh, and, hey, I know I only got to meet Mr. Welton that one time, but, um, well, the fact that a fella his age could still do every move from Donald O'Connor's big old dance scene from Singin' in the Rain, it just gave me a lot of hope for getting older, you know.
Paul loved two things: attention and making her laugh.
You know, I'd forgotten that. Thank you, Ted.
Well, good night.
Shall we?
Mm.
Florence does like wounded birds, doesn't she?
[chuckles] Let's go this way.
Yes, she does.
[breathes deeply] …they're great, bro.
You and Sam taking a break?
How did you know that?
I'm your mother. I know everything.
Besides, I saw him coming out of the cupboard looking sad.
Right.
Drink, please.
Come on, then.
[Deborah, Rebecca chuckle] Aw, look. You look like a little boy there.
Oh. Well, you cut my hair.
Yeah, I always wanted a boy.
What else have we got in here?
Look how long my hair was.
Home videos.
I've probably taped over that.
I bloody well hope you haven't.
Look at your cheekbones there. My gosh.
[girl squeals] Why am I sitting in a bowl?
[laughs] No, you made that our pool.
[Rebecca laughs] All the other neighborhood kids who had pools, they'd come specially over so they could swim in your bowl.
It's a good bowl. Mmm.
It is.
Aw.
You're still my little girl.
Oh, Mother.
You are my little girl.
[babbles] [static increases] ["Never Gonna Give You Up" starts] I think you had a bit of a thing for Rick Astley, Mother.
Well, maybe I did. But that's not him, is it?
Yeah, of course it is.
No, I thought he was Black.
[song playing] [sighs] That's Rick Astley?
Yes.
[sighs] ["I Remember" playing] 
@@@@@@
[crowd chanting] Go, Sam Obisanya… [Arlo] Today has been all about one man.
[whistle blows] Take a bow, Sam Obisanya. The first hat trick of his career.
Three goals for Obisanya.
Three points for Richmond as their incredible run of form continues.
They will now enter the final match of the season one win away from promotion back to the Premier League.
An incredible turnaround.
Thataway, Sam!
[Arlo] What a performance by the young Nigerian, Chris.
[Chris] It's exciting to see a young player realizing his potential, Arlo.
One more, one more. One more.
[chuckles] All right, bro. See you later.
See you later. All right. Peace.
[yells, laughs] Yeah.
Bravo, Sam.
Three goals.
All right. See you later.
That's gold. That's it, dude.
Congratulations, Sam. Well done.
Aw. Thank you, Liza.
[chuckles] See you later.
[cell phone beeps] [sighs] Well done, matey.
[sighs] Wish me luck.
[engine revs] [man] Watch out!
[theme music plays] I can't believe it's happening.
The whole idea of it has got me going like… [shrieks] Oh, stop. You getting all… [shrieks] …is just fear getting in the way of what you deserve.
Are you making fun of me with my… [shrieks] Of course not.
It's just, you went… [shrieks] And I thought I can't improve on that.
I'm just gonna have to replicate it.
Aw, thank you. [chuckles] [knocking] Bing-bong, you ding-dongs.
Ted.
Yeah?
Guess who is going to be featured in Vanity Fair's business issue as a powerful woman on the rise.
I finally got it? This is incredible!
Ted.
Yeah?
Not you. Keeley.
Oh, that makes more sense. Hey, congrats, Keeley.
That's gonna be a Vanity Fair to remember.
Oh, it's just an honor to be mad fit and successful.
Yeah.
[both shriek] [shrieks] So, ladies, I'm here both to give and receive.
Dr. Sharon's last day is tomorrow, and we're all chipping in to get her something special.
What did you decide on? Oh.
An envelope of cash.
You know, I figured she already has all our deep, dark secrets.
Kinda tough to top that with a scarf and a candle, you know?
Right.
Yeah. Whatever you got.
Oh. Let's see.
Oh, you know what? Here you go.
Lovely. Thank you. Oh.
[chuckles] [Ted] Oh. Yeah.
Yeah. It all spends the same.
All right. Appreciate you.
[knocking] Hello, people.
[Ted, Keeley] Higgins!
Leslie.
I just received an email from Edwin Akufo, and he wants to speak with you, Rebecca.
Okay.
Who is Edwin Akufo?
His father owns the largest tech firm in Ghana.
Wait a second. I thought I did.
Until he died last month.
I apologize for my joke.
Edwin just inherited £1.2 billion and loves football.
Mmm.
And?
And I think he wants to buy the club.
Hi. Uh, got the suit Ted bought you back from the dry cleaners.
Oh, it's my suit.
The second Ted gave it to me, ownership transferred, and it became my suit, Will.
Right.
Oi, are my eyebrows crazy?
I've gotta do a photo shoot with Keeley tonight, and the photo shoot coordinator told me my eyebrows are crazy.
Jesus, are my eyebrows crazy?
They wanna do a "at home with the footballer boyfriend" shot.
Bet they won't even use it.
She also told me I've gotta wear all black so that Keeley pops.
Wh-- You're always wearing black.
This isn't black.
This is dark heather charcoal.
Ooh, I love hearing fellas debate fashion. Who's winning?
Oh, um, Ted, can I run a new tactic by you?
Yeah, you can run it, walk it, cartwheel it to me. I don't care.
Call me Dumbo, 'cause I'm all ears.
Is that a yes?
Yes.
Okay. Um, when we play Brentford, we should play with a false nine.
Couldn't agree more. What is that?
Play without strikers.
Okay. Wait, so Jamie and Dani ain't gonna play?
They do, but they play in midfield where no one expects them to be.
Yeah.
I see.
Okay, so we got both our aces tucked up our sleeves, huh?
[clicks tongue] Love that. That's fun.
Okay, today let's go ahead and try out your fake nine.
False nine.
Hey, this looks very nice.
Thank you.
[sighs] Here we go again.
Give Ted yet another idea he'll take all the credit for.
[Nathan sighs] That's the job, son.
[inhales sharply] Do you guys ever wanna be in charge?
Be the boss?
Get all the credit?
You know, we used to believe that trees competed with each other for light.
Suzanne Simard's field work challenged that perception, and we now realize that the forest is a socialist community.
Trees work in harmony to share the sunlight.
Can't you just give me a straight answer for once?
I think he just did.
Right. When this works, which it will, I'm telling everyone it was my idea, which it was.
[sighs] Your eyebrows aren't crazy.
Thank you.
They're psychotic.
I appreciate that.
They can't maintain their lines.
[sighs] These guys are just not in sync.
It's okay.
Oh, hell no. No, no. Hey, hey. [blows whistle] No. No, no. Guys, come on. That ain't gonna cut it.
Y'all gotta be together on this, all right? It's like this.
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie. Yeah?
Then the hands. Bye, bye, bye. All right?
And watch my jumps. Ain't no lie.
See how I'm jumping? Like I'm a marionette.
That's why this song is on the album No Strings Attached, all right?
[team murmurs] [Ted] Yes. Okay, good.
Now, look, fellas, performing this at Doc's going-away party ain't gonna mean Bo Jackson diddly squat unless she can tell how hard we worked on it.
You know what I mean?
It ain't the execution. That ain't the gift. It's the effort.
Yeah? Okay? You see what I mean?
[sirens blare] [engines approaching] Uh-oh.
[helicopter approaching] Okay.
Okay.
[chuckles, sighs] My most sincere apologies.
I was told your training would be finished by now.
Oh, that's okay. Hakuna matata, right? [chuckles] [chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry. That was kind of racist, wasn't it?
Oh, you know, uh, Timon and Pumbaa are cartoons.
So I'll let it slide.
Hey, I appreciate you.
So, you must be Edwin Akufo, huh?
Yeah, I am.
I'm Ted Lasso.
Uh, so I don't shake hands.
But I have someone who does. Uh, Francis.
Oh. Hi.
Yes.
[speaking Twi] Whoo, whoo!
That is one of the best handshakes I've ever hand shook right there.
Firm yet comforting, you know, like a weighted blanket for my hand toes.
So, I bet you're looking to chop it up with Miss Welton, yeah?
Uh, if that's not impossible.
Well, you say impossible, but all I hear is "I'm possible." [Ted chuckles] Makes more sense when written down.
Ah, okay.
Yeah.
Right this way, fellas.
Thank you.
Take it from here?
If it's gotta be me.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, Greyhounds, now let's get in formation!
Will, here we go!
["Bye Bye Bye" playing on cell phone] Five, six, seven, eight.
Come on.
Good.
Hit this.
[panting] That was it!
[team cheers, whoops] [player] Yes!
I cannot tell you how much I admire what your club has done this season.
You know, relegation destroys some teams, but it's only seemed to have made yours stronger.
That's all 'cause of the boss right here. Trickle-down economics may stink, but trickle-down support smells like pizza, roses and, I assume, Viola Davis.
I do care about this club, Mr. Akufo.
Very much.
That's why I'll cut straight to the point and tell you that I'm not interested in selling.
Oh, I'm not trying to buy your club.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm interested in buying one of your players.
Sam Obisanya.
But Rebecca loves Sam.
Yeah, we all love Sam.
Exactly.
Also, uh, Sam is under contract with us for another three years.
Yes, I understand.
Therefore, I would offer you a generous transfer fee of so much money that people would think I'm crazy, and you've taken advantage of me, in a financial, non-sexual way, of course.
[chuckles] [Higgins] Ah.
I believe he's making you an offer you can't refuse.
Oh, Godfather, I see you.
Well, I'm refusing an offer he can't make.
Is that a quote from the third movie?
[mutters] I just have one question.
What club is it that you actually own?
Oh, I don't.
At least, not one I can talk about yet.
But it is a team in Africa, and I figured that Sam might appreciate the opportunity to play near his family.
You know, his home.
Well, gosh dang it. Now I wish we had two Sams, you know?
One for y'all and one for us.
Where are we at with cloning these days, by the way?
Them Scottish folks have been mighty quiet on that front for a while, which means we gotta be close, right?
Yeah, well, like my father used to say, a sad white man is still a white man.
Word.
All I'm asking is for an opportunity to speak to Sam.
Maybe let him decide for himself, yes?
Yes.
[knocks] Oh, uh, I hope I'm not interrupting.
Ah, perfect timing.
Sam, this is Edwin Akufo.
Oh, he doesn't like to shake-- [chuckles] Mr. Akufo would like to speak with you.
I figure we could, uh, maybe go to a museum, have something to eat.
Uh, sure. [chuckles] Ah, wonderful. After you.
Okay.
It's lovely to meet you all.
Bye.
You too.
[door closes] So strange.
I once wrote a play about a billionaire who took a footballer to a museum and then dinner.
Whoa.
[chuckles] What happens in the play?
Well, they get their meal for free because they found a little bit of glass in the pasta.
[Rebecca] Ooh.
[Higgins chuckles] God, I wish I could write fiction.
[Higgins] Oh, thank you, Keeley. You know, I should revisit that work.
[Keeley] Yeah.
[Higgins] Hmm.
[hums] Hi.
[gasps] [gasps] No.
[sighs] Sorry. You got me.
[chuckles] Wow, I didn't expect you to be here.
No, me neither.
[both chuckle] What can I do for you?
Well, um, I just wondered if you'd mind helping me pick out a fancy suit?
Abso-fucking-lutely. Perfect timing, actually.
I've gotta pick up some outfits for this photo shoot I'm doing.
Come with.
What, now?
Now.
Let's go kill two birds with one stone.
All right, yeah. Let's go… murder some birds with a rock.
[laughs] That was good.
[chuckles] Yeah?
Yeah!
I got attacked by a bird once.
Did you?
Young man, I think you're late for class by about 25 years.
[laughing] Would you like a lollipop?
No.
It's Coach Kent, which can only mean nobody told him it's a half-day and Phoebe's mom picked her up hours ago.
Fu… …n.
That's fun, innit?
Okay. See you later.
Mm-hmm. I always thought this was what the teachers did when we went home.
Art fundraiser tonight.
For 20 quid, you can buy a kid's art.
For 40, I'll send it home with you already in a rubbish bin.
That's a solid business model.
Which one of these is Phoebe's?
Oh, I won't be able to display Phoebe's artwork.
Why not?
Oh, no.
She draws ti-- Unnervingly accurate charcoal sketches of breasts, yes.
There were more, but some of the boys stole them and I think are using them as currency.
Bloody hell.
Nice.
Do you need a hand?
Yep. [chuckles] [cell phone beeps] Unless you need to go. [chuckles] No, I got time.
Oh.
[Henry] It's show-and-tell today.
Should I bring my Jamie Tartt jersey or my LEGO Hogwarts?
Mmm. I gotta go with the Jamie Tartt jersey for fear of how Hogwarts might travel, you know?
Good thinkin', Abe Lincoln.
Hey, buddy, I gotta let you go, okay? Have a great day at school. I love you.
[Henry] Love you.
[door closes] Hey, boss. What's up?
Right, I'm just gonna come out and say it.
I had a torrid affair with Sam.
[Henry] Dad, I'm still on.
Oh, uh-- Hey, uh, sorry about that.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Bye, Dad.
Uh-- Yeah.
Um, okay, so let's see.
You and-- Sam.
…uel L. Jackson?
Obisanya.
Right, okay. Just checking.
Um, okay, well, you know, I think that's great.
Hold on.
Wait. No-- Yes. Yeah, I do. No, I think that's fine.
I think I need to end it.
Sure, I can see that.
I mean, I asked him for a bit of time to figure things out.
Mm-hmm.
And now we're in a bit of a limbo situation.
Great party game, horrible relationship status.
And then Edwin Akufo swoops in to take him away, and I've lost all objectivity.
Hmm.
[sighs] Sam's a really great player.
One of the best we got.
[sighs] But do I want him to stay because of my feelings for him?
Good question.
I mean, we really were great together.
I mean, come on.
Sam and Rebecca are already one of my all-time favorite TV couples.
To have one of them in real life? [whistles] Yes, please.
But if he wants to go, I shouldn't stand in his way.
I could not agree more.
But if I let him go, I might regret it for the rest of my life.
Ooh, turns out, I could agree more.
[chuckles] Mmm.
Well, Rebecca.
[clears throat] Listen to me.
Don't listen to me.
Don't listen to Edwin Akufo.
Don't even listen to Sam.
You just listen to your gut, okay?
And on your way down to your gut, check in with your heart.
Between those two things, they'll let you know what's what.
They make good harmony, like two-thirds of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, you know what I mean?
[breathes heavily] Thank you, Ted.
You know, boss, you're starting to develop a bit of a habit.
Am I?
Oh, yeah.
Same time, same place last year, you dropped another truth bomb on me.
See you next year.
I can't wait.
[both chuckle] [gasps] Oh, my God. That's so good, I can't even look at you.
[laughs] Thanks, Jacques-o.
Oi, how you doing in there, babe?
[Nathan] God, this place is so posh. [chuckles] Feel like I'm not supposed to be here.
I mean, this place is for rich twats who piss away all their money on an outfit they only wear once.
[Nathan chuckles] But, Nate, today you are one of those twats.
[chuckles] I quite like that.
Oh, this is so much fun.
Yeah.
Roy never does this stuff with me.
He's always like, "I'm Roy Kent." [chuckles] "Why do I need to go shopping?
I already own a black T-shirt and jeans." [laughs] [Keeley growls] This is yes.
Oh.
But I'm worried about the crotch.
Does the crotch feel loose? The crotch looks loose.
Keeley, thoughts on the crotch?
Oh, my Go-- I think the crotch looks great.
We can have the crotch taken in.
It's better to have a tight crotch than a loose crotch, you know?
But we love the suit, yes?
[stammers] Uh, I-- What do you-- What do you think?
No, I don't think this is it.
No.
Take it off immediately.
Would you guys like a drink?
Oh, yeah, go on.
Glass of champagne?
Mm-hmm.
I'm all right, thanks.
Oi, it's free.
And… when you see the prices, you're gonna wish you'd drank more of it.
Oh, my God. Uh, yeah-- Um, yeah.
A whiskey, thank you. Please.
Knock knock, Doc Doc.
Oh. [chuckles] Oh, please don't tell me you're taking my office now.
Wha-- No, no. I just came up to invite Doctor Sharon to Colin's birthday party tomorrow night.
Ah. Oh-- Uh, Colin's birthday is August the 21st.
I love that you know that. [chuckles] Yeah, I know everybody's birthday.
Really?
Liam Neeson.
June 7th.
Tina Turner.
November 26th.
Chuck Norris, Sharon Stone, and Osama Bin Laden.
All March the 10th.
Whoo, you are good. And you're right.
Colin's party was just a cover story for Sharon's going-away party.
Not bad, huh? [chuckles] Uh, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Ted, but Sharon's already gone.
Uh, beg to differ, Higgy Stardust. Sharon's last day is mañana.
Yes, but an emergency came up, and she has to leave tonight.
Wait, she left without saying goodbye?
Uh, she wrote everybody a letter.
Um, mine was very nice.
Here's yours.
No.
Don't let her get away with it, Ted!
Yes.
Wow.
I know, right?
Kelechi Nwaneri.
Yeah, his work is incredible.
Well, he's Nigerian.
[chuckles] I just bought it.
So I can donate it to the Cape Coast Castle Museum in Ghana.
This piece belongs in Africa.
It's amazing.
Even for a Nigerian.
[chuckles] Sam, I'm a walking confliction.
I am a billionaire, yet I don't believe billionaires should exist.
That's why I'm breaking up my father's empire.
I'm using the money to make better things and hopefully make things better.
[sighs] You are not at all what I expected.
Ah.
You don't even have a security detail.
Okay.
That's because I bought out the entire museum and, uh, filled it with actors.
[chuckles] Oh, I thought I recognized him from I May Destroy You.
Are you hungry?
Starving.
Ah, I know a perfect place.
Edwin.
Ah, it's good to see you.
Uh, this is my friend, Sam.
Hey, you all right?
Lovely to meet you.
Ah, congratulations. You both just met a cool person.
Hmm. Cheers.
See you.
Pretty cool, eh?
What?
That was Banksy.
Banksy?
Yeah.
The-- [imitates spray can] Yes. [imitates spray can] Oh, my God.
Sorry. [sighs] Yeah, let's do it. Thanks, babe.
Mm-hmm.
[gasps] Fuck me!
Yeah?
Yeah.
You look so hot.
I just wanna fix your tie really quick.
Come here. Okay.
Thank you so much, by the way.
You're so good at everything, and you're always helping people and making things better.
Just like you.
[chuckles] Sorry.
It's all right.
[clears throat] Do you ever, um-- Do you ever feel like you wanna be the boss?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I did used to worry that I was gonna end up like my mum.
Mmm.
[sighs] She spent years working at the same company tirelessly just for a man to take all the credit.
She wasn't brave enough to dream big.
So, I decided to do things very differently.
And then I met Rebecca, and she inspired me to wanna be a boss.
[chuckles] People like you and I, we can't help but dream big.
[chuckles] And no one is gonna fight harder for their dreams than us, right?
Right. [chuckles] Mmm.
The scariest part of all of it is making the decision to just go for it.
'Cause once you do that, then everything just sort of falls in-- God. I'm so s-- I'm so sorry. I didn't-- That's okay.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is. Don't worry about it.
No. No, it's fine-- N-- It was-- No, it was-- It happens sometimes to the best of us.
It's not-- It's fine. I just, um-- I-- God, I'm s-- I'm gonna get outta this-- Don't worry about it.
I do worry about it.
Don't.
Shit.
[breathing heavily] Is that a younger year?
Nope, same year.
Then why are their pictures shit, and yours are… not shit?
Ah. Well, I take the pictures before they can fuck them up.
They hate it, but I know it's for the best.
Ah, so you're Ms. Bowen, the mean teacher.
Well, Phoebe likes you.
Well, she's smart. Most of them hate me.
They have, like… [sighs] …20 different mean nicknames for me.
Go on.
I don't know any of them.
Ms. Bowlegs, Ms. Boring, Ms. Bonehead, Ms. Bellend, Boaty Ms. Boatface… [sighs] …and then there's one little boy who simply calls me Fuck-witch, [chuckles] which is admittedly my favorite.
Well, best teachers are the toughest ones.
My first coach used to chase me round the pitch on a motorbike like we were in fucking Mad Max.
That's terrifying.
Yeah, but it made me fast.
[alarm rings through PA] [sighs] The half-hour countdown begins.
Nothing worse than parents' mixers.
They get free chardonnay, and I get to ward off all the single dads.
And not-so-single dads.
Right.
Are you married?
No.
[cell phone chimes] I've gotta go.
You're not gonna stay for the art show?
No, sorry.
Thanks for all your help.
Ooh. [chuckles] Karen, for God's sake, grow the fuck up.
Well, well, well. Look what the weird bike rode in.
Ted, how long have you been standing out here?
A long time.
And I really gotta use the john too, but I'm gonna hold it a bit longer, 'cause I'm so dang ticked off at you.
I was right. It's a lot easier to navigate that hallway with this thing all folded up.
[chuckles] Thank you for carrying it up.
How could you just leave?
Sorry, I'm not good with goodbyes.
Well, when I was a baby, I wasn't good at walking and talking, but I stuck with it and look at me now.
Did you get my letter?
Yes.
Did you read it?
No!
We had a whole thing planned for you.
You know how hard it is to get grown men to learn choreography?
Almost impossible. Heck, we even got you a gift.
Spoiler alert, it's a bunch of cash.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
But Ted, you knew I was leaving.
I did, but I thought I was gonna get a chance to say goodbye to you.
I mean, my wife left me, my dad left me, and you, more than anyone in the world, knows how I feel when I get abandoned, and you just left.
I wrote about that. It's all in the letter I left for you.
Wait a minute, thi-thi-- Okay. You mean this? This right here?
Guess what. I'm not gonna read your letter, ever, okay?
You got something to say to me, just say it to my face.
I thought we had a breakthrough.
You did. You confronted things you had ne-- No, no, no. Not me. I'm talking about us.
We did, Ted.
[scoffs] Yeah.
Thanks to you, I've learned that expressing my vulnerabilities can help my patients with theirs.
You helped me become a better therapist.
And that's saying something, because I was already fucking brilliant.
[chuckles] That's nice of you to say.
And yet, you were gonna leave without letting me know any of that.
Ted, it's all in the letter.
It's all in the letter!
It's all in your le-- Okay, well, fine. I'll read your stupid-ass letter.
Unbelievable.
[sighs] Mm-hmm.
You spelled "favorite" wrong.
[scoffs] [mutters] [breathes shakily] It's a very good letter.
I feel more comfortable writing goodbye than saying it. I'm sorry.
It's okay. I understand.
My train to Royston doesn't leave till midnight.
Wanna grab a drink?
[scoffs] I'm buying.
Yeah, okay. That'd be nice. Yeah.
But I really gotta pee first. I gotta-- Door to the left.
[sighs] I've never had West African food this good in London.
[stammers] I can't believe I didn't know this place existed.
Uh, well, it doesn't.
I had it created for us.
I brought in my own chefs.
[chuckles] I travel often, and I know what it's like to miss the food from home.
Actors?
Friends.
Huh.
Listen. I wanna be honest with you.
I don't see myself leaving Richmond to play for, well, whatever team you end up owning one day.
[chuckles] Sam, you are the fourth person to know this.
I'm buying Raja Casablanca in Morocco.
My only focus in life will be to make us one of the biggest clubs in the world.
Bayern, United, PSG, Barcelona… Casablanca.
[sighs] Hmm?
The greatest African players around the world will come home to play for us.
Mark my words, in 20 years, an African team will win the World Cup.
Sam, you inspired the world to care about what's happening at home.
That's why I want you to come play for me.
I want the incredible man you are, not the footballer.
Although the footballer too is incredible.
[both chuckling] Uh, thank you.
[stammers] I mean… [sighs] You've given me a lot to think about.
Please. Take all the time you need.
[sighs] You have 72 hours.
Hey, please. Finish the jollof. Huh?
I insist.
Thank you. Uh, you know, I appreciate that you had it made the Nigerian way.
Uh, well, I thought you'd prefer it, even though the Ghanaian way is better.
Oh, I know we've been getting along, but I will-- I will fight you on this one.
Let us fight then.
[chuckling] [chattering] Oh, wonderful, Mr. Kent.
Uh, we've got you upstairs. You'll start in the black suit, and then we'd love for Nicky to take a pass at your eyebrows.
[grunts] [sighs] Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.
You're not late, babe. Your outfit's in the closet.
You look cool as fuck.
[chuckles] Thank you.
Mmm.
How was suit shopping with Nate?
Yeah, it was fine.
Um… I know that you hate this stuff, babe, but it's gonna be good, yeah?
Please say that it's gonna be good 'cause I'm re-- really losing it. I'm so nervous. [chuckles] Babe, you've done a thousand magazines.
You did an advert for a service station where you jumped out of an airplane topless eating a hamburger.
You can't be more nervous than that.
But this isn't that.
It was about how I looked.
This is about me.
I had to do an interview, like a real interview.
But they asked me about my thoughts and my feelings and my goals for the future.
[breathes deeply] When people read this article, they're gonna see me.
See the real me.
The real you is fucking amazing.
And now the whole world is gonna get to see that.
You are Keeley fucking Jones, the independent woman.
[chuckles] You're gonna kill it.
[gulps] So I should keep my top on?
Maybe for one shot.
[chuckles] Thank you.
[no audible dialogue] [laughing] [cell phone ringing] Hello, Dad.
Yeah.
[chuckles] It was incredible.
Yeah, yeah, he took me to a museum. An-- And then we had Nigerian food!
Okay, great. And, um, now look at one another.
Come on then.
[sighs] [chuckles, grunts] [chuckles] That's wonderful. Can I get the 85, please?
Switching lenses. Will only be a second.
Yeah.
All right, so, earlier when I was suit shopping with Nate, there was a little misunderstanding.
He tried to kiss me.
It wasn't a big deal, but I just thought, you know, you should know.
Shit. That must've been awkward.
[chuckles] Thank you for telling me.
I was talking to Phoebe's teacher earlier for three hours.
And at the end she asked me if I was married, and I just said no, nothing else.
I don't know why.
At the funeral, Jamie told me he still loves me.
[photographer] Okay. Here we go.
Turn to me.
[clears throat] Well, well, well. Look who knows her way around a pinball machine, huh?
[chuckles] I love pinball.
Yeah.
It's one of the most entertaining forms of meditation.
Your only opponent is yourself and gravity.
[clicks tongue, scoffs] Yeah, two things we're stuck with.
At least until that Elon Musk fella stops messing about on Twitter and starts focusing on jet packs.
[chuckles, sniffs] Mmm. "SMF," huh?
Oh, le-- let me guess.
Sharon Mildred Fieldstone?
Sexy motherfucker.
Rest in peace, Mr. Nelson.
Mm-hmm.
[Ted] Mmm.
Another round?
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Come on now.
[chuckles] This one's gonna be on me. Actually, you know what? No.
Still gonna be on you, Dr. Moneybags.
[sighs] If you excuse me, I'm gonna go hit one of my favorite British words, and my absolute favorite Diamond Phillips, the loo.
[chuckles] Another two, please, Mae.
Okey dokey. [chuckles] Thank you.
You're the shrink for the team, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Go on. Ask her.
I'm scared of snakes.
Like, really scared of snakes, even the tiny ones in my garden.
Does that mean anything?
Do you want it to mean something?
I just don't wanna be afraid when I'm tending to my tomatoes.
Because the garden is your safe space.
Is it about the snakes, or is it about the fear and anxiety slithering into your consciousness?
[gasps] That's it.
The last one! That's it!
Sorceress.
I have a recurring dream… Oh, God.
…where I'm floating.
Not flying, floating.
Piss off, you three.
You want psychiatric help, call the number I gave you.
Think about it.
[Paul] Thanks.
[chuckles] Thanks, Mae.
There you go, love.
Oh, no. I ordered two.
Ted asked me to give you this.
[scoffs] Son of a bitch stole my move.
[sighs] Here's one with no shit in it.
[chuckles] Thanks.
I can't give you an answer about us.
And I know I can't ask you not to go.
But I hope you don't go.
I should go.
[alarm beeps] [keys clatter] [cell phone beeps] [chuckles] [cell phone beeps] [cell phone beeps] [cell phone beeps] [typing] 
@@@@@@
[woman] We're on in five seconds.
Four, three, two… [music plays] Good morning. It's Friday.
Glad you could join us. I'm your host, Jeff Stelling, here with Chris Kamara and George Cartrick.
As we head into the last weekend of the season, we have an update on those rumors of change at West Ham United.
But first, we turn our attention to the championship and AFC Richmond, the club of our former foulmouthed colleague… [Kamara chuckles] …Roy Kent.
The headline this morning is the news that Ted Lasso left in the middle of the Tottenham match this season not due to stomach problems, but because of a panic attack.
[Arlo] Lasso appears to be, uh, leaving?
[Stelling] George?
Lasso's clearly not fit to coach.
[Kamara scoffs] Come on now, George.
Be compassionate.
Oh-- Come on. Come on, Jeff. Come on.
Would-- Would, uh, Bill Shankly have a panic attack, eh? Would Brian Clough?
Would Alex Ferguson have a panic attack?
Aw, be fair.
No, of course he wouldn't. Look, if-- if your ship's being attacked, right?
And you run to the bridge, you want to find a captain whose brain works, not some big girl's blouse.
[Kamara sighs] I miss Roy.
[George, Kamara chuckle] [sighs] [cell phone beeps] [beeps] [Sharon] Hi, Ted. Remember, the truth will set you free, but first it'll piss you off.
I'm here if you want to talk. Good luck this weekend.
[phone clicks] [beeps] [typing] [chuckles] [typing] [chimes] [clicks] [breathes deeply] ["Yesterday's Papers" plays] [shutters clicking] Hey, fellas.
[chuckles] [photographer 1] Yeah.
[photographer 2 laughs] Good one.
Morning, Susan.
Oh. Are you all right, Ted?
Yes, ma'am. [chuckles] Are you sure about that?
[Coach Beard] Hey, Coach.
[sighs] [grunts] Oh. Thank you.
Hey, wanker.
If my father had a panic attack at Normandy, we'd all be speaking German.
Yes, sir.
Just do the work, pal. You'll be all right.
I assume you know what that was all about, yeah?
Nope.
[theme music plays] [sniffs] Oh, those are lovely. Who are they from?
Edwin Akufo.
Oh.
"Sorry for your loss." Oh.
That was thoughtful of him.
He must've heard about your father's passing.
I've not finished. "But we will give Sam a very good home in Casablanca." Ah. Still, nice gesture.
[Rebecca sighs] So, uh, Leslie, any rumblings about which way Sam's leaning?
Not a peep, and I'm trying to play it chill.
So whenever I see him in a hallway, I just give him a cool nod.
You know, like this.
Oh.
Oh, shit. That was cool.
I know, right? I saw it in a Denzel Washington movie, and I thought, "Oh, I'm taking that." [chuckles] Still, it's not looking great.
[knocks] Hey. What's the story, Paul Shorey?
[all] Ted.
So sorry about the article, Ted.
Oh, that's okay, Keeley.
You know what they say. No such thing as bad publicity, right?
Although, I think they might've been wrong about that one, which is a bummer 'cause they were spot on with the beer before liquor thing.
Here you go, boss.
Thank you, Ted.
And you know that you have our full support.
I appreciate that.
I still wish I could've done something before that dick Trent Crimm posted the article.
Oh, no, come on. Trent's a good guy. He's just doing the gig.
Well, don't worry. I'm gonna speak directly to the owner of the paper and see who this anonymous source was.
Nah, come on, no need. Fact is, everything they said was true.
And unlike Lieutenant Kaffee, I actually can handle the truth.
Mm-hmm.
Well then, my advice is no press until after the match.
Hmm. I agree.
Concentrate on the task in hand, beating Brentford.
Yes, because if we lose, it will kill me.
Please don't lose, Ted. I beg you.
Hey, don't you worry, Hig Newton. I'm on it like a bonnet.
Oh, God. These taste like shit.
Oh, yeah. Well, it was a rough night, and I am now absolutely positive that I switched the salt and sugar. I'm sorry about that.
[retches] No, no, no.
No, it's interesting.
She's a sneaky, salty bitch.
Hmm. Like Heather Locklear on Melrose Place, right?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Right?
Mmm.
That's exactly how you'd describe her.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Oh, Heather.
[chattering] [Sam] Hello.
[Thierry] I will not be safe out there.
Hey.
[breathes shakily] All right?
Is, uh, Roy here?
I don't hear any grunting.
Ah.
Hey, morning. [inhales sharply] Morning, Nate.
Um, is Roy here?
No. [inhales sharply] You seen this? [sighs] Mm. Oh, uh, uh-- Yes, I-- Oof. It's awful.
Yeah.
Yeah. It was awful.
Yeah.
Roy-- Jamie's looking for you.
Oh, is he?
Oi!
Tartt!
Me?
Through there? Yeah.
[sighs] Wait. Can I-- Can I just say something first?
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea 'cause when I'm done, you won't have any teeth left, and you'll need them for the talking bit.
Right, uh, um-- Yeah, okay. Uh… [clears throat] So, at Rebecca's dad's funeral, I told Keeley that I still loved her.
It was wrong, and I shouldn't have done it, but I ain't used to being around dead people.
It-- It just-- It did something to me, emotionally, you know?
But I still-- I shouldn't have done it, and it was wrong, but I just need you to know that I respect you, and-- and I respect Keeley, and I respect your relationship, and I will never ever do anything like that ever again.
Fuck!
[door slams] [Will] Whoa.
Sorry. I kind of froze when you two came in here, and I-I-I just didn't know what to do.
All right.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, no, it definitely sounds both helpful and compassionate.
[inhales] But I don't think that you moderating a session between Coach Lasso and a celebrity psychiatrist is the best move right now.
All his attention is on Brentford.
Thank you very much.
Fuck you, Piers Morgan.
[gasps] Holy fucking shit!
Oh, my… [giggles] [blows whistle] Circle up!
Thank you, Coach.
Hey, fellas.
Before we get started here, I wanted to talk to y'all about the article you saw in the paper this morning.
Actually, y'all probably saw it on your phones.
I still get the paper, 'cause, well, you can't cut cartoons out of a phone, right?
Yeah, but you can screenshot them and text them.
That's copyright infringement, bruv.
Oh.
I hear you, Zoreaux, but you can't hang a screenshot on a fridge either.
My refrigerator has a television.
Oh, I think I have the same one.
[players chattering] I bought it-- The point is, y'all found out about something from somewhere, when you should've found out about it from me first.
But I chose not to tell y'all, and that was dumb.
You know, fellas, we make a lot of choices in our lives every single day, ranging from, "Am I really about to eat something called Greek yogurt?" Ooh.
To, "Should I leave my family and take a job halfway around the world?" Me choosing not to be forthright with y'all, that was a bad choice.
But I can't be wasting time wishing for a do-over on all that.
'Cause that ain't how choices work. No, sir. No.
That choice, and my Chicago Bulls Starter jacket that I let Janelle Rhodes borrow my sophomore year 'cause she spilled ketchup all over herself, and it looked like she'd been shot, those are two things I ain't getting back.
'Cause every choice is a chance, fellas.
And I didn't give myself the chance to build further trust with y'all.
To quote the great UCLA college basketball coach, John Obi-Wan Gandalf, "It is our choices, gentlemen, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." Now, I hope y'all can forgive me for what I've done.
'Cause I sure as heck wouldn't want any of y'all to hold anything back with me.
Nah, we got you, Coach. We got you.
[Sam] We got you, Coach.
[players chatter] Yeah, no problem, gaffer.
And when we sniff out the rat, permission to take socks full of soap to their stomach and chest?
We're gonna find 'em and fuck 'em up!
[players yelling] Yeah!
We'll kill him!
Follow the money!
[blows whistle] No, fellas, look. I'm gonna nip that talk in the butt right now.
It's "bud" not "butt," Coach.
It is? Oh, 'cause of flowers, right?
Horticulture, baby!
That makes more sense. I appreciate that. Thank you.
No, look, gentlemen. I want us to focus on something a little bit more productive, like working on Nate the Great's false nine.
How's that sound? Okay, good.
[players] Yes. Yeah.
[Ted] Okay, anybody got any questions before we get started?
Yeah, I got one.
Yeah, Jamie, what do you got?
What are we gonna do with that fucking thing there?
[players chattering] Yeah, that's a good point. Okay.
Well, tell you what, let's all head to the north field, and if you guys hustle, that'll count as our cardio for today, yeah?
Scram! Whistle! Whistle!
[knocks] [Higgins] Come in.
[gasps] [puppy whining] Oh, what's this?
This is Mascot Idol: Semifinals.
One of these two contestants will be our new mascot.
Will it be Macy Greyhound or Tina Feyhound?
[chuckles] Aw. Are they all from Barkingham Palace?
Yep.
[Higgins] Miss Campbell here runs the shelter.
London's premier all-female dog breeder. Suzi Campbell. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Huge fan.
Oh, thanks.
Huge fan.
Thank you.
[chuckles] Is now a bad time?
Um, no. Uh, could you give us a minute, please?
Oh. Sure.
Wow. [chuckles] Nice to meet you.
Um, something wrong?
Actually, something is incredibly right.
The money people that back Bantr, they wanna finance me opening my own PR firm.
[chuckles] Oh, my God!
I know, right?
[sighs] I need some advice.
I'm-- I'm flattered that you came to me instead of Ted or Roy. [chuckles] They're at training.
Well, instead of Rebecca then.
She's the one I'm afraid of telling.
I'm happy to be on the list.
I'm scared.
Well, look. That is perfectly natural.
It can be terrifying becoming a boss.
No. I'm scared of telling Rebecca I'm leaving.
Oh, right. Because she's so intimidating.
No. She's one of my best friends.
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. And you leaving would be a betrayal on a level usually reserved for Greek mythology.
No.
I just-- I don't want to appear like I'm not grateful for the amazing opportunity she's given me here.
Keeley, a good mentor hopes you will move on.
A great mentor knows you will.
Ooh. I like that.
Yeah? Just made it up.
Wow.
I told Edwin Akufo I would give him my answer after the match on Sunday.
[Sam's father] Does this mean you've made a decision?
[inhales sharply] I think so. [sighs] Hmm? Yes?
[sighs] I don't know.
Mmm.
I'd be crazy not to go, right?
Samuel, you're overthinking this. Relax.
Stop looking for the answer and let the answer come to you.
If you open yourself to it, the universe will give you a sign.
Daddy, w-with all due respect, isn't this decision too important to be left to the universe?
The universe has always put me on the right path.
The universe told me to marry your mother and to buy Bitcoin in 2009.
2009!
[both chuckle] Okay, Dad. I'll keep an eye out for any messages from the universe.
Uh-huh.
I love you.
I love you.
[players in park shouting] [chuckles] [water running] [water stops] This morning, Jamie apologized to me for what he said to you at the funeral.
I didn't say anything.
I know. He said he did it on his own.
What did you do?
What do you think I did?
Punched him.
Headbutted him.
Keep going.
Did you murder him?
No. Worse. I fucking forgave him.
It's disgusting, innit?
No. I'm really proud of you.
I fully support that.
[sighs] Wait. I've got some news too.
Oh, for fuck's sake. Don't tell me Ted tried to get off with you and all.
The VC that back Bantr, they want to finance me opening my own PR firm.
Holy fucking shit. That is huge.
Whoo! [shouts, laughs] You are a fucking CEO and shit. That's amazing.
[chuckles] I know.
I love you so much.
[moans] [kisses] Look at you. The boss.
[chuckles] Not gonna have time for me anymore.
Shut your pretty mouth.
[people chattering] [cell phone buzzes] Just need a second. It's Jane.
Hmm. How's all that going?
Uh, we broke up. [sighs] [phone vibrates] Oh. We're back on. Phew.
Here you go, boys.
Mmm. Thanks, Mae.
Thanks, Mae.
[sighs] Don't worry about it, Ted.
It'll all wash out in a cycle. It always does.
Thank you, Mae.
[sighs] I was finished anyway.
We're opening the champagne.
What? No, I thought we were saving that for something really, really special.
Well, we didn't open it when your mum moved back up north.
We didn't open it when England got zero points in the Eurovision.
And we didn't open it when the neighbor ran over their own snake.
Oh! [shudders] That was nasty.
So we are drinking it tonight. Duck.
[cork pops] Ooh!
[Keeley] Yay. [chuckles] [tablet chimes] [gasps] Shit!
Lizzy just sent over a preview of the Vanity Fair article.
Oh, shit. They better not have used any pictures of me smiling.
Like that exists.
Wow.
[chuckles] Oh, no.
They didn't use any of the pictures with you in them.
Shit, I'm so sorry, Roy. That is not cool.
I'm gonna reach out and change that.
Don't you dare.
Don't you change a fucking thing.
You look powerful. You're fucking gorgeous.
You look like a BILF.
Oh, yeah? Go on, show me, then.
[kisses] So… are you gonna say anything?
Well, I mean, eventually, yeah.
You may have noticed through the years I can be quite loquacious.
No. To Nate.
The anonymous source.
Oh.
Wow. What makes you think it was Nate?
Yeah.
Well, you know my philosophy when it comes to cats, babies and apologies, Coach.
You gotta let 'em come to you.
That's not gonna happen.
Some people need a little push.
Yeah. Well, I ain't pushing nobody.
I think it'll help.
Nate will be fine.
No. It'll help you.
Coach, you keep trying to hold all this in, I'm afraid your mustache is gonna pop off.
[chuckles] Oh. Then I'll look like that fella from The Hangover.
Bradley Cooper.
[clicks tongue] Aw. You're too good to me.
And I like your mustache.
Hi, babe.
Hi.
Have you got a second?
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
No, don't be.
It's good.
You helped this panda become a lion. [chuckles] I'm so proud of you. [chuckles] [cries, sniffles] Thank you.
[chuckles] [phone vibrates] Holy fucking shit.
Oh, no. Now what?
Rupert's just bought West Ham United.
No.
[sighs] And to think for a second, I thought him giving me his shares in the club was a kind gesture.
[sniffles, sighs] You know, I'm actually quite reassured to find out that he is still just a selfish conniving cock.
Yeah. It does return a certain balance to the universe, doesn't it?
[both chuckle] Promise me you will not go and work for him.
He can't afford me.
[chuckles] Richmond is my football club. You know that.
Hmm.
Well, that's if we get promoted. [sniffles] You might not want to work with us.
[laughs] That's fair. [sighs] A bit of advice for being a boss.
Hire your best friend.
[cries] Fuck you.
[both chuckle] [cries, sniffles] Now I'm crying again.
[cries] [people shouting, chattering] Anyone want a ticket?
All right, Mae?
Oi, oi, Mae!
Come on, Richmond!
[crowd] Come on, Richmond!
Come on, Richmond!
You get out there and you beat 'em.
We'll smash it, right?
You get them. Fuck 'em.
[Jamie] Go, Coach.
Hmm.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon. [chuckles] All right. Y'all good to go on running Nate's false nine today, yeah?
Well, you'd be fools not to.
[Ted] All right.
[clicks tongue] Yeah, we ought to give it a shot.
Why change it now?
I agree.
Whoa! Uh-oh. Did you get kicked out of your office again?
No, no. Temporary relocation while they change the carpet in there.
It was absolutely covered in dog shit.
Oh, yeah. No, been there, done that.
Okay. Well, anybody else got anything they wanna talk about before we head out there?
Yeah. Um, I could, uh, uh, use some, uh… advice.
Wha-- Hold on.
Roy, are you saying you wanna become a Diamond Dog?
Fuck no. I'm just saying I wouldn't mind being in the room whilst it fucking happens.
Yeah. O-Okay. Well, how about a one-time visitor's pass for our junkyard dog here, yeah?
[howls] [howls] Woof.
Diamond Dogs, mount up!
[Ted] Yeah. I gotcha.
Yeah. I'm just gonna stay put.
Okay. Good idea. Yeah.
[Ted grunts] You live, you learn, right? Thank you, Alanis.
All right. Roy.
Bark away.
Remember I told you I had to do that photo shoot thing with Keeley?
Yeah, we got it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I know I said I fucking hate doing those things, and I do fucking hate doing those things.
But in the end, they didn't use a single picture with me in it.
And it hurt my… feeling.
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
In year five, I was not allowed in the class photo because I developed a rare smile allergy.
Oof. [grunts] Not the same situation.
The thing is, sh… she looked so fucking great.
On her own.
Without me.
So natural.
I-- It would've actually been fucking weird if I was in the pictures.
And then at Rebecca's dad's funeral, Jamie fucking Tartt tells her he's fucking in love with her.
Whoa.
Dah!
And he's still alive?
Yeah. Instead of beating him to death, I fucking forgave him.
I'm still fucking furious about it.
Okay. Well, Roy, we appreciate you barking at us.
Um… [clears throat] There's something I, uh, I have to confess as well.
Um… Go ahead, Nate-dawg.
[clicks tongue] Roy, when Keeley and I went shopping the other day, I kissed her. [sighs] Yeah. She told me about it.
It's okay.
I-- I kissed her. I kissed your girlfriend.
We're good.
All Jamie did was talk to her, and you wanted to kill him.
Don't you at least wanna headbutt me or something?
You made a mistake, Nate. Don't worry about it.
No, no, I deserve to be headbutted.
I'd be happy to headbutt you, Nate.
Okay, you know what? I think that's enough right now.
We got work to do, yeah? Diamond Dogs dismount?
[howls] [howls] Wait. So sometimes the fucking Diamond Dogs is just chatting about shit, and no one has to fucking solve anything and nothing fucking changes?
Sometimes. Yeah.
That's cool.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Oh, my God.
[crowd cheering] [mouthing words] Yes, yes, yes! Whoo!
[Arlo] It's the 83rd clash between these two teams and there's never been more at stake.
Brentford with the lead but Richmond are still in their unusual false nine formation.
I don't like it, Arlo. The last match of the season for promotion.
It's a funny time to be pulling out a new strategy.
[fans chattering, shouting] [Arlo] Richmond trying to even it up before the half, but they give away possession, and Brentford have numbers.
[fans cheering] [Brentford player] Yeah!
Fuck!
[Arlo] And that's 2-nil to Brentford.
[Chris] You try new tactics this late with this much at stake and everyone loses their heads.
Stay back! How many times do I have to fucking tell ya? Stay back.
[mouthing words] It's all right.
Hey. We're all right!
[whistle blows] [Ted] It's okay! Come on now!
[fans booing] [Arlo] And it's halftime of what has been a pulsating West London derby.
Brentford lead 2-nil, and Richmond are letting a golden opportunity slip through their fingers.
I'ma shoot y'all straight. This is bleak, yeah?
I mean, look at it out there.
Looks like a Renaissance painting portraying masculine melancholy.
[sighs] Okay, so now what? What we gonna do?
We should abandon the false nine.
It'd work if we had players who knew what the fuck they were doing.
Yeah, I don't agree, Nate. You know, I think we gotta stick with it, man.
You know, they just had 45 minutes to figure out what not to do. Yeah?
What do you think, Roy?
You should ask them.
They're the ones out there actually doing this shit.
Yeah, all right.
All right, fellas.
Coaches and I are having a little debate and wanna get y'all's take on it.
Should we stick with the false nine or switch it up?
[sighs] The tactic is sound, and we're all perfectly capable of executing it.
It will work.
Hey, if Jan Maas says it, you know it's the truth, right?
I wouldn't lie to you.
[giggles] For instance, Zoreaux, you should have saved that first goal.
Bro.
[players chuckling] Okay. It's been decided. We're gonna stick with Nate's false nine.
Now, come on. Bring it in. Let's go.
Here we go, Greyhounds!
[players cheering, chattering] Hey, Captain?
You gonna join us?
[sighs] [sighs] Richmond on three. One, two, three… [all] Richmond! [cheering] Here we go, Richmond!
[breathes heavily, sighs] Hey, Nate.
Hey.
Everything okay?
Yes, Ted. Everything is okay.
What is it? Hmm? What'd I do?
[scoffs] What are you talking about?
Oh, come on, man. You're mad as hell at me. I just wanna know why.
Huh? What have I got to learn here?
You wanna know what you did?
Yeah, please.
Okay. I'll tell you what you did.
You made me feel like I was the most important person in the whole world.
And then, you abandoned me.
Like you switched out a light, just like that.
And I-- I worked my ass off, trying to get your attention back.
To prove myself to you. [breathes heavily] To make you like me again.
But the more-- the more I did, the less you cared.
It was like I was fucking invisible.
You haven't even got the photo I gave you for Christmas up in your office.
Just a picture of dumb Americans.
Now you're gonna play Nate's false nine, so when the team fuck up, which they will, hey, you can blame it on me.
Well, no. Fuck that.
[sniffles] Everybody loves you.
The Great Ted Lasso. Well, I-- I think you're a fucking joke.
Without me, you wouldn't have won a single match.
They would've shipped your ass back to Kansas, where you belong.
With your-- With your son.
'Cause you-- you sure as hell don't belong here.
But I do. I belong here.
This didn't just fall into my lap, all right? I-- I earned this.
I know you did, Nate.
And if I didn't tell you how important you were to me enough, I'm sorry about that.
No, no. You know what? You're full of shit.
Just fuck you, Ted.
[fans cheering] [Arlo] Richmond down two, sticking with their false nine formation as Brentford are on the attack.
Chris, is time running out on Richmond's chances to control their future?
Only if you think of time as linear, Arlo.
Yes, Chris. I do.
[Arlo] Good pressure from Rojas.
That's lovely from Tartt.
Obisanya is in.
He scores!
[fans cheering] And thanks to that Obisanya goal, Richmond's hopes for promotion are still alive.
Let's go! Let's go! Come on! One more!
[cheering] Oh, my God!
That's how you play a false nine, Arlo.
Pack the midfield, stay organized. Look for the gaps. Well done.
Hey, here we go!
[Roy] Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
[team cheering, shouting] Yes!
[Arlo] All the other results are in.
AFC Richmond, miraculously after a historically dreadful start to the season, are only one point out of second place.
[chanting] Come on, Richmond. Come on, Richmond.
Come on, Richmond. Come on, Richmond.
[Arlo] If they can somehow salvage a draw, Richmond will be promoted back to the Premier League.
[Chris] All they need is one moment of individual brilliance, Arlo.
[chanting continues] Come on, Richmond.
[Arlo] Can they find it in time?
Come on, Richmond. Come on, Richmond.
Come on, Richmond. Come on, Richmond. Come on, Richmond… [Arlo] A long ball from the Dutchman.
Tartt is there!
Is this the moment for Richmond?
[fans shouting] Referee!
Referee!
[whistle blows] [Arlo] It's a penalty.
[Coach Beard] Yeah!
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
[crowd cheering] [Chris] We have to think Tartt will be the one to take it.
He hasn't missed a penalty all season.
[fans cheering] [breathing heavily] [Brentford player chatters indistinctly] Dani.
You got this, muchacho.
It'll be fun. Trust me.
[Arlo] It looks like Tartt is giving the ball to Rojas, who hasn't kicked a penalty since, well… Come on, Dani!
[exhales] [teammates chattering] Let's go, Dani!
Here we go, Dani!
[chattering] [fans chattering] [players chattering] [dog whimpers] Football is life.
[crowd cheering] [Arlo] Richmond have done it!
With that goal, they'll finish in second place and will return to the Premier League in their very first attempt.
[chanting] We are going up! We are going up!
We are going up! Yeah, we are going up!
Yeah!
[whistle blows] [Arlo] It's all over!
Richmond have done the impossible through grit, determination and most of all belief!
[Chris] I was promoted a time or two in my career, Arlo.
It's a real achievement.
Richmond deserve this.
[Arlo] They remain a club without a major trophy, it must be said.
[players, crowd chanting] But it won't feel that way tonight.
Final score: Richmond 2, Brentford 2.
And the joy is back at Nelson Road.
[chattering, cheering] Yeah!
Hey! Come on! Come on!
[groans] Fucking hell! What'd you do that for?
So I could do this.
[grunts] Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes! Let's go!
Yeah!
[laughing] Oh!
Yeah!
You want some water?
Yes, please.
[cheering continues] [teammates, singing] ♪ We're Richmond till we die ♪ ♪ We know we are, we're sure we are We're Richmond till we die ♪ ♪ We're Richmond till we die We're Richmond till we die ♪ ♪ We know we are, we're sure we are We're Richmond till we die ♪ ♪ We're Richmond till we die We're Richmond till we die ♪ ♪ We know we are, we're sure we are We're Richmond till we die ♪ ♪ We're Richmond till we die ♪ Sam.

Excellent performance.
Yeah, the goal, of course, speaks for itself, yeah.
But your tactical discipline, hey.
They are certainly going to miss you around here.
Ah, um… [chuckles] Mr. Akufo.
I truly enjoyed meeting you, uh, a-and I'm so flattered by your offer.
I'm sorry, but my answer is, "No, thank you." And I-- I don't believe my time here at Richmond is over.
And-- And for that reason, I have to stay.
I hope you can understand.
You Nigerian motherfucker!
Whoa.
You Yoruba trash.
Who the fuck do you think you are, wasting my time?
You medium-talent piece of shit.
"Medium-talent"?
I will dedicate my life to destroying you, you fucking asshole!
Hmm? You will never play on the Nigerian national team.
Hmm. You understand me, pinky-dick? Never!
Huh?
I will buy your childhood home, and I will take a shit in every room.
And then I will burn the place down.
Yeah. Then, I will sit there, and I'll eat kenkey, and I'll poop on the fucking ashes. I promise you this, hey.
Okay. [chuckles] I will never forget this disrespect.
Fuck you, Sam Obisanya.
Fucking dare!
[crashing, thudding] That dick! [grunts] [grunting, straining] [grunts] Huh?
Yes. [blows raspberry] Poop, poop.
[speaking Twi] [reporters clamoring] Okay, y'all. Hey, settle down, y'all.
Okay, okay. Easy, easy now. Easy. Hey, hey.
Y'all, come on. Calm down, all right? Look, um-- Well, right off the cricket bat here, I wanna address the article written by our good friend, Mr. Trent Crimm from The… [camera shutters clicking] Or rather, I want to share with y'all the truth about my recent struggles with anxiety.
And, well, my overall concern about the way we discuss and deal with mental health in athletics.
[reporters shouting] [knocks] Hey, boss. Just wanted to congratulate you on your promotion.
You too, Ted. Champagne to celebrate?
I'll just take a glass of water, please.
Still or sparkling?
Yes. Still. Right.
You know, before living here, I used to think still water was just folks saying it's still water, you know?
Like, it was water, and it continues to remain to be water. [chuckles] Well, there's no greater education than travel.
A-freaking-men. [chuckles] Well, hey. Next season should be fun, right? [chuckles] Well, one that'll include an old friend.
Rupert's bought West Ham United.
Did he now?
Well, that'll be a nice change.
Having our run-ins with him being scheduled, as opposed to his normal sneak attacks.
[chuckles] Hi, Rebecca.
And Coach.
Uh, sorry. [chuckles] No. Hey. Sam, go ahead. Stick around. I was getting ready to leave.
No, Ted. Stay.
No, no, no, no. It's okay.
Yeah. Okay.
[clears throat] Um, I just wanted to let you both know that I've decided to stay.
[exhales heavily] Hey, that's great, Sam.
Yes. I'm glad to hear that, Sam.
How did Edwin Akufo take the news?
Um, not-- not well. [chuckles] Uh, he stormed off.
He's already halfway back to Ghana.
Oh, shoot. I was really looking forward to that goodbye handshake from Francis. [clicks tongue] [chuckles] Well, I should go.
Hey, Sam. I-- I was just curious.
Uh, what, um-- Why'd you decide to stay?
Um… [sighs] I wish I could say it was because of my feelings for you, but the truth is, I think I need to stop worrying about how others feel about me.
I'm staying because it's what's best for me and my personal journey.
Mmm.
[door closes] Hmm.
Thank you.
He might have been talking to you when he was looking at me.
Yes. I know that, Ted.
[clears throat, sighs] Oh, hell. You crushed that.
[sighing] Yeah.
Coach Lasso.
Hey. There he is. I was worried about you.
I thought you might've been in a bike accident.
Actually, I don't know how to ride a bicycle.
Really? That surprises me.
Why? 'Cause of the hair and the whole vibe?
Yeah, I guess so.
Why the heck weren't you at the press conference?
Because I am no longer a reporter.
I was fired when they found out I revealed an anonymous source.
Oh, snap. I-- I didn't say anything, I promise.
No, I know, Ted. I did.
I'm looking for something different. Deeper.
Hmm. Well, as the man says, you gotta follow your bliss, right?
Sorry you're out of a job.
You know what this makes you now, though, right?
[clicks tongue] Trent Crimm. Independent.
Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. My father made the same joke.
Yeah. He sounds like a cool guy. Mmm.
Well, I hope our paths cross again soon, Trent.
As do I, Ted. I love our chats.
You want a ride?
Well, I prefer to walk, but I appreciate ya.
And Ted, good luck next season.
[handle clicks] [groans] Shit.
[sighs] This the last of it?
Yeah. Just these and Trixibelle.
Right.
I got you a last-day- working-in-the-same-building present.
Here.
Airplane tickets?
You got me airplane tickets?
To Marbella.
How did you get actual printed tickets?
From my travel agent, Kathy. She's old-school.
Roy, are you sure they still take paper tickets at airports?
Like, is the plane gonna have propellers?
Oh, my God. Am I gonna be able to smoke on the flight?
Right, stop it. You are missing the point.
[laughs] Tomorrow, you and I are going to a villa by the sea for six weeks so you can chill out before you start kicking ass in your new job.
And I'm going to take the first holiday I've taken since I was 12, where I don't have to stay in shape or rehab my fucking knee.
I'm gonna gorge myself to death on tapas, and it will take fucking ages.
[laughs] Babe, thank you.
But I can't go.
What? Why not?
I don't start work in six weeks.
I started like a week ago.
Yeah, I know.
That's why I made sure the place has got proper Wi-Fi and everything.
You can do all your emails and shit, but from a balcony with a sea view.
Roy, I'd love to. But I can't.
I-- I just can't.
But you should go.
Are we breaking up?
No. Why would you say that?
Of course not.
You are gonna take a well-earned holiday while I lock myself in a dark room and work nonstop.
And I'll see you in six weeks.
Keeley.
Roy. I love you.
We'll be fine.
I'll see you in six weeks.
[kisses] [growls] Congratulations.
[camera shutter clicking] What's it gonna be?
A Nigerian restaurant.
[man] Move! I want it faster! Go!
[players] Coach! Sir!
[coach blows whistle] Move!
[players] Coach!
[blows whistle] Next. Go.
Sir!
[blows whistle] Move it!
Coach!
[blows whistle] Go!
Sir!
[blows whistle] Move! Go!
Coach!
[whispers indistinctly] [coach] Move! Go!
[players] Coach! Sir!
Move!
Coach!
 @@@@@@
Welcome to London Heathrow.
For your security, do not leave any personal items unattended.
This is the final boarding call for flight 822 to Kansas City.
Final boarding for flight 822.
Paging passenger Lasso.
Report to the ticket desk.
Paging passenger Lasso. Please report to the ticket desk.
Buddy, we gotta roll. Come on. Let's go.
Your mom sent you a text.
Come on, go.
Henry Lasso. Passenger Henry Lasso.
Hey, we're here. We're here.
Sorry about that.
We got distracted.
Little guy was trying to unlock Princess Peach on Super Smash Bros.
Totally understand.
I once held an entire flight to Sydney hostage until I finished the final level of Breath of the Wild.
Feels like a potentially troublesome sentence to say in this setting, but, hey, I appreciate you.
Hello, Henry. It's nice to see you again. Are you excited to head back home?
To all my toys? Yes.
To my country's political landscape? Not so much.
Yeah. Well, I have a tendency to doze off with CNN on.
All right, big guy. Let's get you all set up here.
iPad's all loaded up with a bunch of movies, so no need to watch your neighbor's screen, okay?
Less movies about clowns in sewers, the better, right?
Amen, Big Ben.
Oh, here.
Dad, I made you something.
What you got?
Hey.
A little tiny Premier League trophy? All right!
I can't wait to drink champagne out of this sucker, you know?
I mean, it's just to have until you win the real one.
Well, hey. You never know, right?
I'm sorry, Mr. Lasso, but we are pressed for time.
Of course. Of course. Okay.
Six weeks goes by real quick when you're having fun, don't it?
Hey, do me a favor. When you get home, will you give your mom a big squeeze from me to let her know I love her? Yeah?
But until then, here, you bring it in. Come on.
All right.
Okay. Okay. Hey. I love you, buddy.
I love you too, Dad.
Yeah. All right. Okay. Get out of here.
Come on.
Passengers on Flight 2492 with service to JFK airport, we are now boarding.
Flight to Amsterdam has been delayed and will now be departing from Gate 17.
We apologize for any inconvenience.
Good morning, Ted.
Hey, Doc.
How're you feeling?
Yeah, no. I'm fine. Yeah.
So, how did the drop-off go?
For me or for him?
'Cause I think those are two very different answers.
But no, I'm fine, I think. I don't know.
I just feel kinda guilty about the little guy flying all by himself again, you know?
I understand, Ted. But children are resilient.
And a sense of autonomy at Henry's age is good for him.
No, I know. That's true.
I remember being left at school when I was Henry's age.
I ended up helping our custodian, Mr. Maher, clean half the school until my dad remembered to come pick me up.
He gave Mr. Maher cash for babysitting me.
I showed up to school the next day and Mr. Maher gave me the money as payment for the work I'd done.
So then I used that money to buy him a thank-you gift, but never got the chance to give it to him, 'cause, well, he ended up getting hit by a train.
Wow. I didn't see that coming.
Yeah, well, neither did Mr. Maher.
How are things at work?
Are you feeling good about the upcoming season?
Yeah. Sure.
Well, I guess I do sometimes wonder what the heck I'm still doing here.
I mean, I know why I came, but it's the sticking around I can't quite figure out.
You don't quit things, Ted.
Right. Right. Yeah.
But, hey, maybe my being here is doing more hurting than helping at this point, you know?
Well, as the man once said, "Doubt can only be removed by action." I like that.
I thought you would.
We only have a couple of minutes left.
Okay.
Hey, you still cool with me asking you some personal questions?
For now, yes. Go on.
Hey!
Holy smokes, I love that hat.
I recognize you from that show Leaky Diapers, don't I?
Okay, let's see. You dating anyone?
Pass.
You usually say no to that one.
What team you with right now?
Can't say.
Okay. All right. Well, what sport?
Can't say.
Uh-huh. How many Australians you got on the team?
Nine.
Rugby. What a game.
It's like American football and sumo wrestling gave birth to a baby with huge muscular thighs all caked in mud.
Okay, Ted. I need to go.
Okay. Talk to you later, Doc.
Goodbye, Ted.
All right now.
You finally got off.
Not yet, I didn't.
Bloody hell!
All of them. All of them have us finishing last this season.
It's really annoying, isn't it?
Every newspaper, every television pundit, every lonely middle-aged sports-blogging loser writing in his mother's basement.
You know, Rebecca, that stereotype really isn't true anymore.
For example, our ten-year-old, Terry, started writing a sports blog in our kitchen, which we now call his home office.
For tax purposes.
Right, well, I apologize for the generalization.
Where does your son have us finishing?
Hey, y'all.
Hey, Ted.
Good morning, Ted.
No rhyming salutation. Something wrong?
Way to notice, Amos Otis.
Yeah. Henry went back to Kansas this morning.
Thank you.
Yep, yep.
Dropped him off at the airport a little bit ago.
Now he's up in a plane, 10,000 feet in the sky.
I think they fly higher than that.
Definitely.
Yeah, well, I'm down here on Earth checking my phone every ten minutes, watching his plane get further and further away. Yeah.
But, hey, I didn't mean to come in here and tinkle on y'all's toenails.
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening.
Well, apparently, everyone alive has picked Richmond to finish in 20th place this season.
Except the Daily Mirror, which has us finishing "twentyelf." An adorable but devastating typo.
Okay. Well, you know what?
I predict all their predictions ain't gonna come true.
So, it looks like we got ourselves a prediction Mexican standoff.
Or as they call them in Mexico, a prediction standoff.
Well, the worst part is that they've picked Rupert to finish in the top four.
Rupert's gonna play this year?
What? No.
So you mean West Ham?
Precisely. Everyone thinks he's better than us.
They. Everyone thinks they are better than us.
Yes, that's what I said. They.
So, what's the plan? How are we gonna beat him?
Them.
Exactly.
Oh, boy.
You know, this might be a good time for us to update our roster. Put some more firepower in the team.
That is a great idea, Leslie.
Let's put some feelers out, shall we? Ted?
Well, I know Roy and Coach Beard are working on some new tactics.
And, you know, the fellas we got are already gelling real nice.
I think we're gonna do fine this season.
Ted, this team doing "just fine" is a far cry from you telling me we're going to win the whole thing.
Did I really say that?
Yes, you did. Over there after the Man City loss.
Just before you blasted half a liter of Pellegrino in my face.
Right.
Wait, what happened?
That is the Ted Lasso I want coaching my team this season.
The one who's willing to fight.
Understood?
Yes, ma'am.
You watch, from now on, I'll be floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee.
Except I won't die immediately after using my stinger.
I plan to float and sting for the entirety of the whole season.
Excellent. Right, if you'll excuse me, I have a very important lunch meeting with one Ms. Keeley Jones for some much-needed girl talk.
Hey, tell her we said howdy and...
Yo.
Okay.
You say "yo"?
Yeah, I know. It just popped out-- No. I'm not judging. I loved it.
I wanna make sure I heard right.
Okay. Yeah.
But I-- But I feel like...
Yeah.
That makes sense, right? I could put my-- What? Another one? Dead last.
Dead last? Who wrote that?
Fucking everybody, bruv.
Glenn Hoddle, Graeme Souness, Jermaine Jenas-- Maybe they're trying to motivate us.
Yeah. Thank you very much, Dani.
I had a woman accost me on the street, telling me I should fake an injury this season so I wouldn't have to deal with the misery.
Did you tell her to piss off?
No, she was a nun.
Wait, a nun?
They must get Sky Sports in the monasteries.
Hey. Hey, hey, lads. Hey.
We ain't gonna get relegated 'cause we're together.
And together, we got me.
Statistically speaking, most teams who get promoted are relegated the very next year.
Come on, Jan Maas!
Jan Maas!
That's what happens in the Pre-- Shut the fuck up, Jan Maas.
It's the Premier League. It's just statistics, man.
So I finally watched it.
I liked it.
Gene Hackman was good.
The drunk geezer.
Stuff with the team.
I did have one question.
Yeah, what's that?
Why the fuck is it called Hoosiers?
Hey, what's up, sweetie pie?
What's the frequency, Roy Kenteth?
What you doing? Working on new trick plays or something?
No tricks, just an old classic. Take it away, Coach.
This is the best way for us to play this season.
The 4-4-2, which is-- Four defenders, four in the midfield, and two up front.
Yeah, I got it.
God, I'm proud of you.
Yeah. Henry and I played a whole bunch of FIFA while he was here.
Very helpful. You know, we both learned who Maradona was, and I had to explain to my son why cocaine is actually bad for you.
Please, keep going.
Right. These little pricks have played 4-4-2 ever since they were kids, which means they'll always know what they're supposed to do, and more importantly, where they're supposed to be at every fucking minute of every fucking game against every fucking opponent.
Yeesh. Who invented this thing, the Russians?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, hey, if you think it's a good idea, I think it's a great one.
Let's do it.
Okay.
And look, I know I don't have Nate's fucking tactical super-brain, but I do know it's more important to be solid than clever when you're the underdogs.
Yeah, the underdog. Right. No. Okay. I hear you, loud and clear. Yeah.
Hey, Coach. How come you never hear of an "overdog"?
In German, the "Überhund," but in English, we say "top dog." Or more specifically, West Ham.
Good morning, Coach Shelley.
There he is. The Wonder Kid himself.
Get out.
I understand.
I just don't think Ms. Welton will have a whole lot to say about the unfair advantage of being a female owner in sports.
Thank you.
Fuck you, Joe Rogan.
Sorry, everyone.
This is my friend, my former boss, my angel-mentor-guru, Rebecca.
And, Rebecca, these are the poets and the geniuses behind KJPR.
Hello.
Hello.
Why don't you step into my office?
Yeah? Come on. Yeah.
God, it's like a real office out there.
People typing and being awkward and everything.
It's so bananas, right?
And I found out why I got such a good deal on this place.
I love a bit of corporate real estate scuttlebutt.
That. Yeah.
So, the previous tenants, they had to break the lease because the boss kept getting caught pinching his employees' butts all the time.
Well, one man's grope is another woman's gain.
It does explain why my office comes with fun features like this.
Look. Watch.
Yikes. But also quite cool.
Hey, it's all right.
Hey!
Hey, you're all right. I'm here. Hey.
I'm so busy, I literally have to make time in my schedule to sit at my desk and cry.
And now I've double-booked you.
Come here!
You know who else picked us to finish last?
Please don't say Adele.
Paddington Bear.
It was on his Twitter account.
Yeah, I saw that.
On a scale of one marmalade sandwich to five marmalade sandwiches, we've got no marmalade sandwiches.
Even that sweet little bear does not believe in us.
I think it's probably other people writing for him.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
What the heck is going on out here?
These guys are more distracted than a bunch of cats playing laser tag.
They heard all the pundits saying we suck.
Fuck pundits.
You were a pundit.
Yeah. And all we did was talk shit and eat fucking meringues.
Hey, Coach, I don't know about you, but kinda feels like it's getting a little stuffy in here, yeah?
Like one of those days you wanna have class outside?
What the fuck are you two talking about? We are outside.
Hey, Will.
Yeah?
Come here.
Yeah.
Hey, is Kenneth around today?
Yeah, no. Kenneth lives here.
Yeah. No, he does work a lot, don't he?
No, no, no. As in, he literally lives here at the facility.
He does? Since when?
He-- Ever since his cult got shut down.
Kenneth was in a cult?
No, no, no, no, no. He was the leader of one.
Wow. Okay.
You mind asking him to bring the team bus around for me?
Yeah, yeah.
All right. Appreciate you.
Shall we?
Okay, fellas.
This segment of today's training is now complete.
I need everyone to go hop on the bus.
We're taking practice on the road, and last one in the parking lot has to eat a little bug!
Everyone run except Roy! Let's go!
Run, run, run!
Let's go, let's go!
I feel so much better.
Crying is the best, isn't it? It's like an orgasm for the soul.
You know, in the last three years married to Rupert, I don't think I cried once about anything.
Not even a John Lewis Christmas commercial.
I'm really sorry again about your blouse.
What are you talking about? It's barely noticeable.
Oi, sucks butt that everyone's predicted Richmond to finish last.
I mean, what filthy cocks.
You're not worried about that though, right?
No, not really.
I'm a bit worried that Ted isn't worried enough.
Yeah, but you gotta let Ted be Ted, right?
Yes. I suppose so.
No, I'm more bothered that Rupert must just be so happy right now.
He's really gotten stuck in your head these days, huh?
No!
I mean, yes.
But he's not stuck in the same way he used to be stuck.
I mean, back then, I wanted to destroy everything that Rupert loved and owned and coveted.
You know, like Left Eye from TLC when she burned all her boyfriend's trainers in the bath and ended up burning down the entire house.
Ultimate gangster move.
Fucking legend.
And admittedly, that was me back then.
But the me now doesn't feel the need to destroy Rupert's life.
No, the now me just wants to beat him.
To win.
That's growth, right?
Sure.
But sometimes you've gotta let Rupert be Rupert too.
Ms. Jones, we have a problem.
Barbara, come on. It's Keeley.
And I want you to meet my dear friend, Rebecca.
She owns AFC Richmond.
Yes, of course, Rebecca.
Very nice to meet you.
Hello, Barbara.
Ms. Jones, I noticed a business expense for flowers recurring weekly.
You want to spend £200 every week on flowers?
Yeah.
Why?
So the office is cheerful and smells nice.
Flowers are for two things, Ms. Jones. Dead people and dead marriages.
It was so nice to meet you.
It was nice to meet you.
She seems fun.
She's my CFO.
The company that financed me placed her here.
But she's my CFO, yet sometimes my CFO-- Chief Financial Officer.
Oh, my. I did not know that.
I've been saying "corporate flying object" 'cause it's been making me laugh.
Why didn't you just google it?
Because I trust in the universe.
Right. I have got to get going.
Dinner this evening?
I can't.
No, no. I'm eating meat again.
That's not it. But thank Christ.
No, Roy and I are finally having the talk with Phoebe.
I cannot cancel on him again, or he will kill me.
Okay, well, call me later.
And thank you for the advice.
Thank you for your bosom.
Anytime.
You. Come over here. Come over here.
Come and stand on this line for me. This, over here. Yeah.
This is a very important line.
Everyone, this is the dumb-dumb line.
This is where dumb-dumbs go.
Stay.
You, go in for the dumb-dumb. Try not to join him on the line. Go.
Coach Shelley?
Yes. Yes?
Mr. Mannion would like to speak with you.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Now?
Disco.
Yeah.
Take over here. Five more minutes of this, then run them till they drop.
Okay.
All right. Let's-- Gosh.
Okay.
Just because my name is Disco doesn't mean we get to party, yeah?
There he is. The Wonder Kid himself.
Hello. How was your trip?
Wonderful. Yeah.
I was in St. Barts with dear friends, the Sacklers.
We were legally required to stay 50 miles offshore, but what a beautiful boat.
Well, sounds lovely.
What's lovely are these delightful preseason prognostications. Yeah.
Aren't they delish?
Especially poor, old Richmond.
Can you believe they're picked to finish 20th?
Well, yeah, because there's no 21st.
That's very good.
I hope you've got more zingers like that in your back pocket for the presser today.
I-- Yeah, I might.
You know, they didn't know what they had, letting you go.
Nathan Shelley, you are a killer.
Thank you, Mr. Mannion.
No, please, Nathan. Call me Rupert.
Mr. Mannion, the car is being removed from the lot as we speak.
Good.
Security thinks one of the new cleaners must have parked in the prestige lot by accident.
Yes.
And accidents have repercussions.
I just want to just have a look.
Yes, that's my car.
Sorry.
Is it really?
No. Well, yes.
I mean, it's the one that I drove here in, but is anything really ours?
I can move it.
No, it's okay.
My apologies, Nathan.
Ms. Kakes, let security know that we have found the automobile's owner, and everything's fine.
Yes, Mr. Mannion.
Nathan?
Yeah?
I know you'll make me proud.
I believe in you.
Thank you, Mr. Rupert. Just Rupert.
Plain Rupert.
Rupert.
Thanks, Ken.
Have a good one, lad.
Cheers, Ken.
Look after yourselves.
Thanks, K-Rock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Ken, thanks again for helping us out at the last second.
No worries. You got lucky, really.
Ted, it's a good rule of thumb never to ask a hippie to come in on his day off.
Okay, message received.
All right.
Well, I'll go and smoke some toad venom while I'm waiting.
Then the whole day's not a waste. Cheers.
Okay. Yeah.
He gonna be okay to drive us back?
After the toad venom?
Yeah.
He's usually fine in 20 minutes.
He'll be forever changed, but he can drive, yeah.
Okay, good.
All right, fellas. Follow me.
There he is.
Good to see you again, Coach Lasso.
Hey, nice to see you too, Ivor.
All right.
Come on, fellas. Here we are.
This is the spot here?
Yes, sir.
All righty.
Okay, here we go, guys. Down the hatch.
Nah.
What?
Yeah, we're going down here.
What's he talking about?
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
Yeah. Nah, it's gonna be fine.
Del, look at this shit.
Yeah, why don't you go next?
All right.
Is that Roy Kent?
I don't know.
Roy Kent, is that you?
Get fucked.
Yeah, definitely him.
Yeah, that's him.
Get that on Twitter, son.
Yes.
I just wanted to go through this transfer list.
Some good options here.
Why are you dressed like an umlaut?
Keeley tears.
I've had this dry cleaned now six times.
Can't believe she wears stuff like this on her eyes.
Right. Come here.
Are you sure you want to watch this?
No, I don't want to, Leslie. But it's part of my job.
I need to be ready to comment if Rupert were to say something snide about me or the team.
Where are they, by the way?
Shouldn't they be training now?
Yeah, come on down, fellas. That's it. All right.
Greyhounds, behold the majesty of the London sewer system.
Disgusting.
Yeah, that's what I thought at first as well.
But then, over the summer, Henry and I took a tour of this place with Ivor here.
Why would you take your kid for a tour of a sewer?
Well, it was his idea, actually.
See, what happened was, on his plane ride over here, the fellow sitting next to him was watching that horror movie It, and, well, Henry accidentally ended up watching it too.
So then, when he heard about this tour, he asked to go on it in order to face his fears.
Fucking smart.
Yeah, that is good.
Ain't much scarier out there than a creepy clown, right?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, welcome.
Lovely to see you all, and thank you for selecting our humble little football club to do so well this season.
Twat.
Ivor, my friend, why don't you help these fine fellows with some fun facts about this here feces factory?
Well, back in 1859, an engineer called Joseph Bazalgette and his team built more than 1,200 miles of interconnected tunnels and sewers.
And its creation helped cure a massive cholera outbreak after untreated human waste found its way into the River Thames.
Anyone know what that epidemic was called?
Great Stink of 1858.
That's correct.
All right, go ahead, Ivor. Keep cooking.
The person you are here to see, the Wonder Kid himself, our new manager, Nathan Shelley.
Thank you. Very nice to be here.
I'm pretty sure I said "wunderkind." Doesn't-- It doesn't matter. Doesn't-- Sorry, does anyone have any questions?
Yes, you. Thank you.
How are you and the lads getting on?
Yeah, really great.
Getting to know them.
Getting to know all about them.
Getting to like them.
Getting to hope-- Excuse me a second.
What is he doing?
Sorry, just had to tie my shoe.
Yeah, next question, please. Thank you. Yes?
Coach Shelley, you are now the manager of a contending Premier League team, but just two years ago, you were a mere kit man, washing another team's underwear.
I mean, it must all feel a bit overwhelming for you, yes?
Not for me, no. Because I earned this job.
What's overwhelming is the confusion I feel when someone so intelligent-looking asks such a stupid question.
Meow.
Anyone else?
Yeah, I got a question.
Yeah, go ahead, Isaac.
What the fuck are we doing here?
Silence!
Thank you, Coach. That's a good question, Isaac.
And direct, which is a personality trait y'all's generation has truly embraced, and I tell you what, I've grown used to it, so I appreciate it.
Yeah, well, hey, fellas, take a look around.
What are we surrounded by down here?
Coach.
Yeah, Jamie.
We're surrounded by poopy.
That's right.
But if you ask me, we're surrounded by a whole bunch of poopy up there as well, yeah?
See, gentlemen, right now, y'all's brains are basically London in 1857.
They're blocked up by other people's dookie.
Y'all need to make an internal sewer system within yourselves, and then connect to each other's tunnels, help each other keep that flow.
So if you're ever having a crisis of confidence, you know, borrow some of Jamie's.
Yeah? Or if you're feeling down, you know, get some Dani in your life.
Or you can learn from Richard's vast knowledge of expensive wines.
Fine wines, Coach. The thing is, a great bottle of wine really doesn't need to be an expensive bottle of wine, you get it?
All right, see? That's wisdom right there.
Merci beaucoup.
Yeah. Next question.
Coach Shelley, regarding your old team, AFC Richmond, any idea why everyone is expecting them to finish 20th this season?
Probably because there's no 21st.
Ouch.
Guys, all we gotta do is remember to stay connected to one another and let anything we don't need flow right through all the way to, I don't know, Germany or-- Where does it go, Ivor?
Processed through a treatment plant and dumped back into the ocean, where we swim and get our seafood.
Oh. Okay. Yeah, that's horrible.
All right, y'all get it?
Yes, Coach.
Okay, let's get upstairs, get some fresh air.
Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. On the hop.
No sudden movements near the bus driver.
Coach Shelley, would you like to comment on the new picture of AFC Richmond that's just showed up online?
What picture?
I think I know where the team's gone.
Yeah, well, it makes sense to me.
They probably have to train in a sewer because their coach is so shitty.
Oh, boy.
I really like that Kenneth guy.
He seems really plugged in, yeah?
Oh, yeah. No, I agree.
That nutter told me to ask the fucking Earth to help me carry some of my burden.
He ain't wrong.
That's not a terrible idea.
Oh, boy.
What?
That little prick.
Who?
Just check your phone.
Yo, you see what Nate said about us?
Check this out. Look.
What happened?
What?
You see?
No, no, no.
I better say something.
Hey, hey, lads, lads, lads.
Remember, it's just poopy. Let it flow.
Yeah.
Just like in the sewer.
Bingo, "el ringo".
Clever, Jamie.
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, boss.
Where were you this afternoon?
I took the fellows on a little impromptu field trip.
Yes, to a sewer, Ted. I know. Everyone knows.
And you're upset that I didn't invite you?
No, Coach Lasso, I'm upset because the team that I own is projected to finish last this season.
And my manager decided to skip training and take our players into a fucking sewer.
No, yeah, I can see your point, yeah.
Did you hear what Nathan was saying about you?
Yes, ma'am.
And are you planning on addressing that?
No, ma'am.
Everyone is laughing at us, Ted.
At you, at our team, at me.
Rupert is laughing at me, Ted.
And I am begging you, please, fight back.
Yeah. Sarah.
Hey, I like the new hair color.
Thank you.
You do it just for fun or are you going through a breakup?
Both.
Yep, no, I get it. What you got?
Coach, how are you feeling about the unanimous opinion that Richmond will be relegated again at the end of the season?
Yeah, that's true, isn't it?
Expectations for us are as low as a rattlesnake's belly button, huh?
But, hey, we got 38 chances to prove all them folks wrong though, right?
Yeah. And my hopes are as high as a giraffe's top hat.
Next question.
And if it is, "Why is a giraffe wearing a top hat?" Don't ask me, man.
Go ask a giraffe.
Coach?
Yeah, Marcus.
Marcus Adebayo, The Independent.
Congrats on the new gig.
Thank you.
What have you got for me?
Do you have any response to comments made earlier today by your former assistant coach, Nathan Shelley?
Yes, I do.
Yeah.
I thought it was hilarious.
I mean, he came and got us, didn't he? No doubt about that.
Hey, but that's Nate the Great for you, you know?
He's the same way on the pitch.
He'll find the tiniest little weakness in a team and just want to attack that, you know?
I mean, he's a junkyard dog, man. And smart.
They're real lucky to have him over there at West Ham.
I wish him the best of luck.
I guess I am a little surprised that's all he could come up with.
Especially against me.
You know, not one joke about me being a dumb American?
Come on, man. It's sitting there. I mean, I'm so dumb...
Y'all are supposed to say, "How dumb are you?" Gary.
Why?
Well, I mean, it's just classic joke structure.
Give it a shot. I mean, I'm so dumb...
Lloyd.
How dumb are you?
Okay. Well, I'm so dumb that the first time I heard y'all talking about Yorkshire pudding, I thought it was a fancy word y'all had for dog poop.
Yeah. I mean, I'm so dumb...
How dumb are you?
How-- How dumb are you?
Yeah, all right, well, you know.
Well, whenever I text someone over here about money, I still spell "pounds" L-B-S.
Look, man, I'm not a great coach. Probably ain't.
I've been doing this sport now for three years, and I still get a chuckle every time someone talks about a handball violation.
Yeah, and not one crack about my appearance? About this mustache?
I look like Ned Flanders is doing cosplay as Ned Flanders.
When I talk, it sounds like Dr. Phil hasn't gone through puberty yet.
Yeah, I'm more corny than Kevin Costner's outfield.
I lost you on that one. Yeah.
Swing and a miss.
Yeah. Field of Dreams? No?
I guess y'all don't really like baseball here, so why would you like movies about it? The...
Well, hey, how about this one?
Regarding my panic attacks, I've had more psychotic episodes than Twin Peaks.
I mean, I'm so crazy...
How crazy are you?
How crazy are you?
There we go.
Coach Shelley?
I have a package for you.
Thank you.
It's from Mr. Mannion.
I don't know if I should open it in front of you or wait for you to leave.
It's a car.
I'm finished, Uncle Roy.
Ice cream before dinner?
Either you think I did something very good, or you guys did something very bad.
Phoebs, your Uncle Roy and I have something we need to tell you.
Okay, what?
We're going on a break.
We broke up.
Which is it?
Well-- We broke up.
But don't worry, because your Uncle Roy and I talked, and you and I can still see each other whenever you want to.
Why?
Because we thought you'd wanna hang out with me sometimes.
No, no. Why are you breaking up?
That's a good question.
We're too busy.
But you were both busy before.
We're more busy now.
How so?
Keeley's got her own company now, so that takes up a lot of her time and focus.
And we had a coach quit, so it's now my responsibility for tactics and strategies and shi-- Roy, I know you're scared about that, but it's gon-- Right.
Do you wanna talk about it some more, or...
No, not really. It makes sense.
I mean, you were only together a year.
And few relationships can survive a major career change, much less two.
Besides, my mum and dad split up when I were four, so one of my core beliefs is that nothing lasts forever.
I am happy we still get to be friends though.
Yeah, so am I.
We should probably go.
All that ice cream's already doing a number on my tummy.
Right.
Uncle Roy?
Yeah?
Are you sure you're doing the right thing?
I don't know.
Can I say a bad word?
Go on.
I think you're being stupid.
Something on your mind, Coach?
You ever wonder why we're here, Coach?
In London or on Earth?
Well, both, I guess, but for the sake of this conversation, let's go with London.
Carry on.
I mean, look, I know it's nuts we came here in the first place, but at this point, I can't tell if it's more crazy or less crazy that we're still here.
We grabbing a beer, Coach?
No, I can't. I wanna talk to Henry. Why?
'Cause we just passed your apartment.
Shoot. Okay. Night, Coach.
Night, Coach.
Hi, Dad.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Carmen Sandiego himself.
How was your flight?
It was good. I watched a movie called The Exorcist.
Wait, you did what?
I'm kidding.
That was good. You got me.
Hey, hey, check it out.
I put the trophy you gave me right down here smack-dab in the middle of Nelson Road Stadium.
How about that?
That's great, but why is Nate off to the side?
Well, remember, he's not part of the team anymore, yeah?
Yeah, but you can still be friends, right?
You know what? You're right, buddy. Here.
Yeah. All right. Let me fix that for you right now.
Yeah.
There you go.
Hey, big guy, you know I don't like being away from you, right?
Yeah.
And that I'd only ever do it for something really important.
You know, something I believe in, yeah?
Yeah.
And do you understand why I'm still here?
Of course. To win the whole thing.
Well, now, don't forget. Winning ain't everything.
Yeah, Dad, but you gotta try, right?
No, you're absolutely right.
We always have to try.
Good. Now the universe is alive!
What is that?
Thanos's Infinity Gauntlet. Jake gave it to me.
Oh, snap. Well, that is cool. Who's Jake?
Mommy's friend.
See? It lights up.
Great.
 @@@@@@
So remember that the client pays for the shoot, but we pay for the overtime.
So whatever you do, don't go over.
But make the commercial as good as possible too, right?
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.
And I had an idea.
Maybe we could all have a picnic together in the conference room?
I can't make it.
 I didn't tell you when it was.
 I know.
Come on, Barbara. Could be fun.
We could get to know each other a little. Maybe loosen things up around here.
Well, I've worked with this lot before, and, yeah, this is as loose as they get.
 We'll see about that, Babs.
 Oh, no. Don't.
Yep. I felt that as soon as I said it.
All right, I'm headed out.
Everyone have a great day, yeah?
Oi, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
What wouldn't she do?
Good morning, Viet-- Ted!
 Hey, look who's here. Hi, Keeley.
 Hello, Ted.
Trent Crimm. Are you kidding me?
Hey, nice to see you, man.
You know, they got a big old Ziploc bag full of your hair ties down at the lost and found. You should pop on down, if you still want 'em.
Thank you. Mr. Crimm has requested to follow the club this year.
 He wants to write a book about us.
 Yeah?
I think there's a story here worth telling, Ted.
Yes, and we all love the idea.
But obviously, as manager, we thought you should have the final decision.
Okay.
I mean, geez, you know, like-- No.
Sure, what the heck? Why not? When can you start?
No time like the present. Except 11:11. That's my wishing time.
Or 23:11, if I'm at a military base or Euro Disney.
Right, well. Decision made.
Wonderful. Trent, welcome.
 Holy shit.
 Uh-oh.
Zava is leaving Juventus.
What about their kids? I'm sorry. I didn't know what any of those things meant.
I thought it was like Greek mythology or something.
I was just lost. I just went with that. Sorry.
Zava's a world-class striker who's about to leave his club in Italy.
Cacio later, Pepe.
Apparently, he wants to play in the Premier League because his wife binged The Office and she wants to live in England.
I think you mean Scranton, Pennsylvania, buddy.
No, the British Office, Ted.
That's right. Y'all did a premake over here.
If we got Zava, that would be amazing.
He would be huge for the club's brand. He's got like 90 million followers.
One time he just posted the word "7 million likes." It got 10 million likes.
Yes, but he is very expensive. And isn't he supposed to be a bit of a diva?
Yes, huge diva. Enormous.
He goes through teams like you go through manicurists.
The fumes make me dizzy, and I overshare.
Please don't print that.
Zava has played for 14 teams in 15 years, leaving behind nothing but chaos and trophies.
Beautiful, shiny trophies.
Yes, but, Leslie, who wants to deal with all that drama?
Apparently, everyone who can afford him.
Chelsea, Arsenal, United, West Ham.
I say, let's just go for it.
I mean, maybe he's a handful, but who doesn't love a handful?
I mean, if you're talking salted peanuts, yes, please.
If you're talking Skittles though, no, thank you.
You know, the dye melts, and it gets all over your fingers, makes 'em all sticky.
And that, you can print.
 Wonderful. Let's set up a meeting.
 Great.
 Let's go and get Zava.
 Yes!
 We're doing it.
 Zava dabba doo!
 Yeah.
 Here we go. Yeah, come on.
This is exciting.
So, am I to assume that you're going to pursue a notoriously mercurial player you can't really afford simply because the team your ex-husband owns wants him?
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes.
Love that.
So, hey, come on. Talk to me.
What's it like being the boss of your own Keeley Street Band, huh?
 I think it's going really good.
 Yeah?
- Yeah.
 Good, good.
Well, I do wish that my co-workers would loosen up just a little bit.
 You want my advice?
 Yes.
Y'all should go out and do something together.
You know, like outside of work.
 That's a great idea.
 Yeah, yeah.
Maybe I could hire a shaman and we could do a bunch of ayahuasca under a blood moon.
I was thinking something like an escape room, but, hey, Clamato Clamato, right?
 Yeah. Thanks, Ted.
 Good to see you. Yeah.
 Keeley!
 Yeah?
Isaac. Hi. You all right?
Yeah. Can you help me get a shoe deal?
I'd love to. Any brand in particular?
No brands. Just shoes, in general. You know.
Great. I'll look into it for you.
- Hi, guys.
 Keeley.
Hi, Keeley.
- Hi, Jamie.
 How you doing? You good, yeah?
Yeah, I'm all right. You?
Yeah, yeah. Not bad. Yeah, yeah. Gym.
 Just went to the gym. So, yeah. Good.
 Good.
Glad you're good. I'll see you later.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Bye.
 Bruv.
 What's up, man?
Keeley and Roy have broken up.
What? Who told you that?
It's not "who," bruv. It's "what." Kinesics.
Study of body language. Just look at 'em.
No eye contact, Keeley's crossed arms.
Roy's clenched arse. It's science.
 What do you want?
 You and Keeley break up?
 Who told you that?
 No one.
I use body science.
Why? Is it true?
What's that fucking face?
It's called empathy, you dusty, old fart.
Look, as someone who's been dumped by Keeley, I get it.
 She didn't dump me.
 You dumped her? Why?
I don't want to talk about it. Why'd you come in here?
Let me guess.
You want to know if it's okay to ask her out, right?
No, I was just-- I was just seeing if you were okay, man.
Dickhead.
 What the fuck you doing?
 I was gonna hug you.
 Well, you came at me too fast.
 Jesus, sorry.
I forget how skittish elderly people could be 'cause of the war.
Come on, man. I was just trying to comfort you.
Well, I don't want comfort.
And I told you, I don't want to talk about it.
So don't you say a fucking word. Do you hear me?
Fine, I won't.
And don't you say a fucking word about it either, William.
No, no, I won't.
I actually just went through a bit of a breakup myself, so I can somewhat relate.
Hey, maybe we should all go out sometime.
Us three. You know, get a couple drinks, couple pints, couple shots.
Fishbowls. Single guys club.
Or I can just not say a fucking word.
No, I hear you. I hear you loud and clear.
Well, you are a sleepwalker.
I don't know what else to tell you. Period.
Hey, Coach.
What are you doing?
Just taking a peek at one of these soccer strategy books you always got your nose in.
What do you think?
Well, given the struggles I've already had with the table of contents, I think I might be best served to wait until this son of a gun comes out as a movie.
Hey, let me ask you a couple questions.
One, what would you think if we sign Zava?
That's good, right?
 Zava? Yeah.
 Okay.
Second question. Who is Zava?
He's a living legend. You know who Zava is.
Beg to differ, Claudia Schiffer.
Now why you got me watching the Veggie Dog Vigilante here?
<i>Hey.</i> <i>No way.</i> Because that's Zava.
That's Zava?
Well, shoot. I didn't know this fella played football.
Hey, I said football without even thinking about it.
Boy, that book really works.
11:11. Make a wish.
 What'd you wish for? Come on, Coach.
 I can't tell you that.
I just don't want our wishes to cancel each other out.
 That's not how it works.
 Shut the fuck up.
 Take it back.
 Uh-oh, now what?
Take it back.
I can't take back things that's already happened.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Fellas, what's wrong?
Coach, we just heard the most upsetting rumor.
Okay, is this about us getting Zava?
 What?
 We're getting Zava?
I just wished for that 30 seconds ago.
Wait, no.
Hold on a second, okay?
If y'all weren't talking about Zava, what were you so upset about?
Is it 'cause Trent Crimm's writing a book about us?
What?
Wait, Trent Crimm's writing a book about Zava joining our team?
No, no. He's just coming here to write a book about the team.
Zava's writing a book about us?
No, Trent Crimm.
Why would Zava write a book about Trent Crimm?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop! Okay, hold on a second.
If y'all didn't know about Zava, which may or may not happen, and y'all didn't know about Trent Crimm, which is happening, then what were you so worked up about?
Roy and Keeley broke up.
Coach.
Sorry, no, I'm okay.
Got a little light-headed there. Yeah, thank you.
Fuck's going on?
Tartt!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I didn't say anything.
I will fucking kill you.
No, I came in, and they was talking about us getting Zava.
What? We're getting Zava?
Roy, do you want to talk about it?
No, I'm not talking about me and Keeley.
No, I meant Zava. Do you want to talk about it?
Sure, he's nuts, but he'll help us win games.
That time I was actually talking about you and Keeley.
 Fuck's sake.
 Hey, Will, come here a sec.
 Yeah, I'm here.
 Hey.
I need you to run to my apartment, go into my desk, and grab my CD called "Ted's breakup mix." Okay?
 Got it. What's a CD?
 Okay.
 Oh, boy.
 On it.
Hey, Coach, you gonna need my keys.
 I got a set.
 Right.
 Thanks. Don't worry about it.
 Okay.
Hey, Roy, look, we're here for you. Okay?
We've all been dumped before, right, fellas?
She didn't dump me. I broke up with her.
What?
This day couldn't get any worse.
And this is the locker room. Hello, boys.
 I believe you all know Trent Crimm.
 Gentlemen.
The fuck is this prick doing here?
Trent's writing a book about our season, so let's welcome him with open arms and open minds.
Absolutely. Yes.
Oi! Listen up!
No one says a fucking word around this prick unless they want my forehead through their fucking skull!
Don't worry.
Okay, well...
we'll work out the specifics later.
But until then, welcome, Trent.
I mean, fuck off, Trent Crimm.
And cut! Thank you, folks. Moving on.
Okay. Now the lamb chugs a Cafka mini and poof, turns into a smoking hot lion.
Great, but we can't actually make the lamb drink the Cafka mini, right?
 No, of course not.
 Okay, good.
We were told by the people in the lab, the lamb cannot drink it.
Yeah, no, it will die instantly.
Something about enzymes.
I totally get it.
 I just don't think she does.
 No. I don't think she got it.
Keeley fucking Jones.
Shandy fucking Fine?
Oh, my God! I didn't know you were doing this.
I didn't know you owned a skirt that covered your whole arse.
Oi, you borrowed and never returned many of those skirts.
And I never will.
One of the perks of living with you and the girls.
 The girls! How are they? How's Chloe?
 Married a footballer.
 And Emma?
 Married a footballer.
And what about you?
Married a footballer, divorced a footballer.
And now I'm back here doing this.
But enough about me. I saw you in Vanity Fair.
Fully clothed. And I cried.
I'm so proud of you, babe. We all are.
Proud of me? Why?
'Cause you made it out all by yourself.
What is that smell?
Apologies, lamb droppings are one of nature's most unpleasant aromas.
Just be grateful Clarice here is over 30 days old.
A week ago, her poop looked like sour, yellow toothpaste.
No, no. Don't try and sweep it.
No, you gotta pick it up like sushi or it'll smear.
I was married to a footballer.
That's it. Cheers, babe.
 Hey, Keeley.
 Yes?
Jimmy and I think the club feels too empty.
Yeah, it should feel totally packed.
I mean, can we get maybe another 100 extras?
A hundred more, right now?
Yeah.
You could just add a strobe effect to the post and let people cross close to camera.
It'll feel really packed, and you won't have to spend any more money.
 I love that.
 Let's do that.
Thank you so much.
Look at you. Basically running the shoot.
Maybe one day I'll make it out like you did.
Yeah.
Hello, Mother.
<i>Oh, my God, darling, I'm so pleased to hear your voice.</i> <i>I dreamt last night that you'd been murdered.</i> No, still here.
<i>Wait, why are you in a hotel room?</i> <i>I thought you were meant to be on some three-day,</i> <i>spiritual camping retreat.</i> I am. I'm not sleeping out there.
<i>Far too many stars.</i> <i>I keep thinking they're all staring at me, you know.</i> <i>No, but listen. I've got some exciting news for you.</i> I spoke to Tish the other day, and she's agreed to consider meeting with you.
Wow! Your psychic has actually agreed to let me pay her a lot of money to speak with her? Amazing.
<i>Well, no. She's considering it.</i> <i>But I think you meeting with Tish would be perfect because,</i> <i>well, you know, you are in desperate need of some maternal guidance.</i> <i>Just a minute.</i> <i>There's a group of people gathering outside for scream therapy,</i> <i>which is my favorite bit.</i> <i>So I'd better go now because I mustn't use my voice.</i>  Bye-bye, sausage.
 But you called me.
I have an update on the meeting with Zava.
Great.
 Zava doesn't want to meet with us.
 What? Why not?
His people said, "It would be a waste of time for us and an embarrassment for him." That feels like an unnecessarily cruel response.
But, good news, Zava is signing with Chelsea.
Why is that good news?
Because he's not signing with West Ham.
He came right out and said, "I will not sign with West Ham." Shit. That's only going to make Rupert want him more.
There's nothing Rupert can do.
Great. Now you've jinxed it.
 But I thi--  No, it's too late. Jinxed it.
 But I do think that--  It's done.
Well done.
Afternoon.
Hi.
Jamie.
No. No.
Looking good out there today.
Cool.
Thanks for sharing your office with me.
Even if it was Ted's idea.
So, Richmond against Chelsea?
That will be your first time back there since you retired. Right?
Right.
Sorry.
Yeah, it's my publisher. I'll be quick.
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no. Well, I'm here now.
It's going very well, actually.
I'm just getting settled in.
Yes. Everyone's been...
very welcoming.
Yeah. No, I can hear that noise too.
I'm not sure if that's my-- Is that me or you?
Do you know what? Bear with me. One moment.
I'll take this outside.
 Is this right?
 It is.
Yes. Your company credit card arrived.
Awesome. Thank you.
 Do not use it.
 Okay.
Barbara, I would love for you to meet Shandy.
 Hi.
 Hello. Hi.
She's the newest member of KJPR.
What position has she been hired for?
She will be consulting for affiliate management and...
 client relationships.
 Yeah.
Okay.
Would you have a seat, Shandy? Shandy, is it?
 Yeah. Sorry.
 So, when I p-- Yeah, just put it in there. Put the sweet in there.
Well, I'd love to know what experience you have in these areas.
In relationships, tons.
The rest of it, not much.
And where did you go to university?
 I didn't go university.
 Didn't go?
 No.
 Okay.
And what were you doing right before this?
I was modeling.
Yeah. Okay, thanks, Shandy.
All right. I think I've got it.
So you've hired a former model with no previous experience, no higher education for a job that doesn't exist. Lovely.
Well, welcome to the team, Shandy.
I'm so sorry. I'll handle this.
Barbara, I need a minute to talk with you.
The way you just treated Shandy was incredibly rude. It was hurtful.
 What?
 That is a massive amount of snow globes.
Yeah. I collect them.
Well, you know, the firm sends me from company to company, and, yeah, wherever I go, I just buy a snow globe.
It's a little bit silly, really.
No, I think it's incredibly charming.
You cannot speak to people like that. Not here.
I know Shandy's my friend, and you're right.
She does not have the experience. But she is smart. She's eager. I believe in her.
Like the firm must believe in you to send you all over the world to all those lovely places, right?
Maybe you and I can see how good it feels to believe in someone else.
Together. Yeah?
Client relations coordinator.
That's her title.
Good. Yes. Just in case you hadn't realized, I totally made up that one I told you before.
Hello. Hi.
 Roy.
 No.
I understand your hesitation having me here.
You're protective of the team, and I admire how much they respect you.
It's not easy getting such fulfillment from a second career.
I'm not sure I even got it from my first.
Maybe you could just give me a chance.
Fuck off.
Wow, okay.
<i>A new season begins and hope springs eternal,</i> <i>except perhaps for AFC Richmond.</i> <i>They return to the Premier League after a one-year absence</i> <i>but are widely expected to have a rather short stay.</i> Worse yet, their campaign begins here at Stamford Bridge, the home of the formidable Chelsea Football Club.
To be promoted to the Premier League is like going from a council estate to the penthouse, Arlo.
<i>Richmond should enjoy it while it lasts.</i> Gentlemen, welcome back to the Premier League.
Back where we belong. Pip pip.
Feels like we never left.
Here you go, lads.
Mae. I got the fish and chips.
I had the burger.
It's good to be back.
How's work? How's your friend doing?
Shandy? Yeah, she's doing great.
 Good.
 Yeah.
She's just full of ideas.
 Excuse me. Excuse me.
 Uh-oh.
 Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me.
 Any news?
Zava and Chelsea are pretty much a done deal.
I have the confirmation of that from a very reliable source.
What source?
A friend of my wife knows an agent whose masseuse moonlights as an airline steward on private jets.
Now, she wasn't working today, but her coworker who can read lips, he saw Zava mouth the word "Chelsea" a lot.
 God, I wish I could read lips.
 Yeah.
Okay. Has anyone seen Rupert? Is there any sign of him?
No, Rebecca. He's not here. And even if he was, there's nothing he can do.
Great. Jinxed it again.
Fuck you, you old geezer.
 Hello, Roy. Welcome back.
 How you doing, mate?
Heard the news.
I broke up with her.
Why? I mean, you guys were perfect together.
Fuckin' Bruce.
Oi, that's Roy Kent.
 Roy!
 Roy Kent!
We love you, Roy!
He's here, he's there, he's every fucking where, Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
He's here, he's there, he's every fucking where, Roy Kent, Roy Kent! He's here...
<i>Now that's a lovely moment.</i> <i>Chelsea fans letting their former captain, Roy Kent,</i> <i>know how they still feel about him.</i> Roy Kent, Roy Kent!
He's here, he's there, he's every fucking where, Roy Kent, Roy Kent...
 Thank you.
 Oh, my gosh. Is that Zava?
There he is.
Look, it's Zava.
Zava! Zava! Zava!
<i>And the great Zava makes his appearance.</i> <i>Will he be signing for Chelsea today? What are you hearing, Chris?</i> <i>All sorts of things.</i> <i>The crowd, your voice, a slight ringing because I bumped my head earlier.</i> Holy--  Jamie.
 What?
It's Zava.
 So what, man?
 My heart is racing.
I haven't been this nervous to play in front of someone since I was in El Chapo's youth league.
Move, man.
Oh, my God. I cannot believe it.
Wow, we're in the same city as Zava.
Thank God we dressed up.
<i>The players are in position, awaiting the referee's whistle.</i> <i>And we're off. Another season begins.</i> Leslie, will you pull yourself together?
<i>Hughes tries for Todd, but Chelsea intercepts.</i> <i>The Greyhounds are in massive jeopardy now.</i> <i>Some invention. Look at that pace. High-pressure football.</i>  And Chelsea on the board...
 Fuck!
 ... with beautiful counterattack...
 Shit.
<i>... against a reeling Richmond.</i> No!
<i>Absolutely devastating.</i> Take off those fucking hats. They're bad luck.
Same old shit.
 The ref blows his whistle...
 It's all right.
<i>... for the conclusion of the first half, and it's Chelsea 1, Richmond nil.</i> <i>You have to give Richmond credit for hanging on as long as they did, Arlo.</i>  That's beautiful.
 Yeah.
What now?
I might've jinxed it.
I knew it.
Would you please go and find out as much as you can from your vast network of lip-reading massage therapists?
Okay. Pardon me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
 Rupert's gonna land Zava.
 You don't know that.
Years ago, when I was bartending in that private club, Rupert and his then wife came into the bar.
He was the life and soul of the party.
Buying rounds of drinks for everyone, telling stories. Just charm personified.
And he left me a massive tip. And then about a week later, he came back without his wife and asked me out.
 I, of course, said no. Then he left.
 What a dick.
But then he came back the next night and the next night and the next.
And he would just sit at the bar with a drink and chatted to me until close.
And he just said, "It doesn't matter if you ever go out with me.
It's just worth it being here to get to know you." It's a fine line between stalking and romance.
And after about six weeks of that, he asked me out again.
And I said yes without any hesitation.
Because by that point...
I just felt so lucky because he wanted me.
He made me feel special. Chosen.
He made me feel like that.
Hey, fellas. Listen up.
We get one goal, we're right back in this thing, yeah?
But right now, we are being so unoffensive, we might as well be a Hallmark Christmas movie, you know what I'm saying?
 What?
 What's that?
I mean, Coach, how many shots on goal we have that half?
 One.
 Yeah, that's what I thought.
And that one was pretty much a mistake. Am I correct, Dani?
Yes, it bounced off my face. But my face almost scored.
Yes, it was close.
 Coach.
 Yeah, Jamie.
 One idea.
 What you got?
Right, so every time they're going past the halfway line, they're just-- Trent, hold on a second.
Roy, can I speak with you?
Oi, what the fuck's a Hallmark Christmas movie?
Hey, look, man, I don't know what your beef is with Trent, but I'm gonna need you to order off the vegan menu right now and squash it.
'Cause your ego's about to sabotage a whole lot more than a silly football match.
You feel me?
Thank you.
And Hallmark Christmas movies are films that feature women from the big city falling in love with their childhood crushes.
It's usually some fella that owns a Christmas tree farm.
Sometimes he's also Santa Claus or a prince.
They suck, but they're great.
But they also mostly suck.
But they're also kinda great.
They're good with the sound off.
Now go fix this, please.
Crimm!
It's actually quite funny when he yells at other people, innit?
Hold this.
"Newcomer Roy Kent is an overhyped, so-called prodigy whose unbridled rage and mediocre talent rendered his Premier League debut a profound disappointment." Do you know who wrote that?
I was 17 years old.
This fucking wrecked me.
I thought I was being edgy.
I was just trying to make a name for myself.
All I really did was look for the worst in people. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Give me that.
You know, it's funny.
 We had a lot in common back then.
 We did?
We both thought one another sucked shit at their job.
And now look at us.
 Go.
 Yeah.
Oi.
You can talk around this prick now.
Oi. Hold on, yo, yo, Jamie. What were you saying?
Yeah, man. Listen. What I'm saying is, every time we go past halfway, they're just blocking up the passing lanes, you get that?
Yes, yes. That's right. They're not marking us.
So just keep dribbling until they stop you.
Exactly! Let's take it all the way and fucking win this.
Yes! Yeah!
Thank you, thank you.
Well?
I just got off the phone with my son's karate teacher, who used to date the woman who ran Zava's avocado farm--  Would you please get on with it?
 He might be going to West Ham.
 Shit.
 I knew it.
Rupert always gets what he wants.
You know what?
If Rupert can sweet-talk Zava into joining his club, then so can I.
 Yes.
 Excuse me.
Thank you. Sorry.
<i>And we're back for the second half.</i> <i>Chris, do you think either of these teams made any adjustments in the locker rooms?</i> <i>I'm sure they did, Arlo.</i> <i>But professional athletes don't mind adjusting themselves in public either.</i> Hello there. Rebecca Welton, AFC Richmond.
I'd love to see Zava. Thank you.
No one gets in to see Zava.
 I just saw Mr. Mannion--  Rebecca, my dear.
 Rupert. What a lovely surprise.
 Yeah.
 There you go, Mr. Mannion.
 Thank you, Matthew.
Congratulations, by the way, on the win against Leicester yesterday.
Thank you. Yeah. We are so lucky to have a manager like Nathan.
He's a gaffer who really understands the game. Such an advantage.
Zava. Let me introduce Rebecca Welton. My ex-wife.
And the owner of AFC Richmond.
Yeah, of course.
It's an honor for you to meet me.
See you soon.
Can't wait.
He will look so great in claret and blue.
You know, Rupert, I was a little bit surprised when you bought West Ham.
I always thought that Richmond was your one true love.
Guess I'm just like any man. Just get bored with the same old, same old.
Good luck with this season.
You are such a fucking chickenshit.
I mean, if you were great, truly great, you could play anywhere.
But instead you choose a club like West Ham, because it's big and shiny, and you know that they'll win whether you're there or not.
And you'll never have to wonder if you're still as good as you tell everyone you are.
But you and I know that you're not. You're overrated. You're overpaid.
And you eat too much fucking asparagus.
<i>Richmond's defending has kept them in this match,</i> <i>and they are one moment of inspiration away</i> <i>from going home with an unlikely point.</i> <i>Well, Chelsea giving Hughes space.</i> <i>If they're going to give him space, he's going to take it.</i> <i>Possibilities here. Hughes has options.</i> <i>He slides it through to Tartt.</i> <i>Is this the moment?</i> <i>Obisanya's gonna have a go.</i> <i>It's in, off the face of Rojas!</i>  Absolutely brilliant.
 Yes!
<i>In the blink of an eye. Would you believe it?</i> <i>An historic goal, and it's 1-1.</i> My face scored a goal! My face scored a goal!
Chris, have you ever scored with your face?
I've scored with every part of my body, Arlo. That's a ridiculous question.
 That was amazing.
 Yeah, mate.
Do you think Zava saw?
Don't be a dick, man.
Come on.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Oi, how'd it go?
 Did you sweet-talk him?
 What's the opposite of that?
Sour-yell.
Yeah, I did that.
<i>And Richmond managed to secure a 1-1 draw</i> <i>against Chelsea in this gripping West London derby.</i>  There we go. There you go.
 They'll be leaving Stamford Bridge <i>with a well-deserved point on the table.</i> Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us.
Obviously not the result we were hoping for today.
But I am certain that this afternoon's announcement will raise every Chelsea fan's spirits.
 Now, I know...
 Still think we need to get to the office.
It won't be safe here.
<i>Please welcome the newest member</i> of Chelsea Football Club.
Zava.
Welcome, Zava. Please take a seat.
All right. You just sign. And there's the pen.
Please.
I have changed my mind. Zava will not play for Chelsea.
Oh, God. I'm sorry. I can't watch this.
Zava will play for Richmond.
You twat!
 May I keep the pen?
 Sure.
What?
What the fuck?
 You did it.
 Yeah.
 You did it!
 Oh, my God.
Yo! We've got Zava.
What?
We've got Zava! Look!
Shit!
Fans are not gonna like this.
Zava! We got you, Zava! We got you, Zava! We got you, ra, ra, ra!
 All right, man. Take care, man.
 Take care.
 Zava is coming here.
 Zava.
What you up to tonight, Coach? You wanna race-walk home together?
Can't. Jane and I are gonna go see her friend's immersive theater show about the menstrual cycle.
All right, well, I hope you're not late.
Please tell Jane I said hello.
I would, but she still finds our relationship threatening.
 Night, guys.
 Good night.
Night, Coach.
What do you say, Mr. Crimm? Heck of a first week, yeah?
And we've only just begun.
 Good night.
 Night, Roy.
Hey, Roy. I'm just curious, what was it like being back at Chelsea?
All them fans sure were happy to see you.
I don't know. Just felt... sad. Or something.
Really? Why is that?
Last season I was there, we played a match against Arsenal,  and we fucking murdered 'em.
 I remember, 3-nil.
Yeah.
But I played like shit.
Right?
I did.
That was the first time, ever, I thought, "I can't keep up anymore.
I'm not good enough." And that was all I could think about for the rest of the year.
I knew it was only gonna get worse. So at the end of the season, I left.
Everyone was shocked. The club was shocked. The fans. The press.
Yeah.
I didn't wanna be one of them broken-down footballers just taking up space until they're dropped, years after they should have been.
Yeah, well, a lot of folks think it's better to quit than to be fired, you know?
Yeah.
But going back there today...
there's a part of me...
thinking maybe I should have stayed...
and just fucking...
enjoyed myself.
But that is not who I am, I guess.
Not yet.
But, hey, if you wouldn't have left Chelsea when you did, we probably never would have met.
 Good night.
 Good night.
Good night, Roy.
Sport.
It's quite the metaphor.
Yeah. It also makes for a heck of a nickname.
Yeah.
 Night, Ted.
 Good night, sport.
 
@@@@@@
 Morning.
 Morning. Made you some coffee.
I don't do caffeine.
Right. Your body is a temple.
Well, I don't know about that. More like a church in an airport.
Big day for Richmond.
Thought you didn't know anything about football.
I don't. But I know who Zava is.
Of course.
Text me when you get back from Dubai?
 Safe flight.
 Thanks. Safe driving.
I am a strong and capable man.
Bollocks.
Okay. So obviously Zava's gonna be moving into our starting lineup.
Which means, if my maths...
are corrects, we're gonna have to sit someone.
Who's it gonna be?
Well, I think it's gotta be Colin.
Ouch.
Colin's a chameleon. He can change depending on a situation.
Bigger issue is, you put Zava up front, either Jamie or Dani's gonna have to drop back to midfield.
So, who do we think will take the news better? Dani or Jamie?
Dani.
Yeah. Nah, Jamie's a lot like my mom's Precious Moments figurines collection.
- I have no idea what that means.
 He's a fragile little bitch.
Brevity is nice, but sometimes clarity is the true soul of wit. Thank you, Roy.
It's almost ten o'clock, we should probably get going.
You feeling okay?
A little bit nervous. Had some diarrhea earlier this morning.
Please don't put that in the book.
I've never been clear on the spelling, so I probably won't.
D-I-A, double R, H-E-A.
Except in England, you have a silent O, as in, "Oh, no, you've got diarrhea." I'm in the same boat, Higgy bear.
My tummy's got more knots in it than Wayne's World 1 and 2 smooshed together.
I don't know why. I've been around great athletes all my life.
Heck, Roy, you're a great athlete.
Not like Zava.
Come on, don't sell yourself short.
If anything, sell yourself tall and get it altered later.
No, Zava's different. Just watch.
We can't just watch. We gotta make this fella part of the team.
Coaching a superstar can't be all, "How do you solve a problem like Maria?" Although, if you ask me, the Nazis were the real problem in that story.
- Am I right, Coach?
 Yeah. Come on, Mother Superior, - let's have a little perspective.
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.
Sorry, Roy, I know you don't like all this musical theater talk - this early in the morning.
 No, I'll allow it.
I used to fancy Julie Andrews. Well, I still do, to be fair.
The voice, the eyes, the way you know she'd tell you off if you'd been bad.
Yeah.
All right, we gotta do it. All-time favorite Julie Andrews character. Go!
Fuck it. Maria!
- Resolute as always. Coach, what you got?
 Eliza Doolittle.
Audio-only performance, I love that.
- Professor Higgins.
 Come on you Poppins!
Same, I'm right there with you.
Trent, you have one? You don't have to. You got one?
Clarisse Renaldi, Queen of Genovia.
Fuck yeah, Princess Diaries.
Deep cut. Zagged.
Wow. Wow. This is nice.
I can't believe it's really happening.
When I was a boy, I played in Zava boots, I slept in Zava boots, I made love for the first time to Zava boots.
Think you mean "in Zava boots." No.
Hey, you know, last night at the restaurant, as the painters were finishing up, I spent a very pleasurable hour on YouTube watching Zava's greatest goals.
By the end, my head was spinning.
Though it may also have been the paint fumes.
The way Zava moves on the pitch... Like a panther.
So sexy, eh?
Sound a bit gay, bruv.
Well, I'm gay...
Huh?
... for Zava, I mean.
That's true. Some men have a charisma that transcends orientation.
Paul Newman, Idris Elba, Norm Macdonald.
Zava is definitely one of those charisma unicorns.
Okay, you guys have convinced me. I'll have sex with Zava.
Hey, what's up, man?
What the fuck is this?
All right, fellas, come on. Showtime. Let's everybody head out to the pitch.
- Let's go.
 Hey Jamie, come on, man.
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't wanna keep our newest teammate waiting.
Let's do this.
We want Zava! Come on!
This is what you get.
Where the hell is he?
Leslie! We do have a signed contract, don't we?
Of course. We have an e-signature. That's legally binding.
I think.
I'll make a call.
His agent hasn't heard from him, but she's tracked his phone which is currently in Mykonos.
If he has changed his mind again, I'm going to look like an absolute arsehole.
Maybe we can try and cheer them up somehow?
Do you want me to take my shirt off and run across the pitch?
You must be Shandy.
Shandy's shadowing me for the day. To get the hang of things, you know?
It's so nice to finally meet you.
I'd love to go for a coffee and pick your brain sometime.
Like, how tall are you?
 Shandy.
 Yeah?
Would you go to concessions and start selling merch at half price?
 Great idea.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Keep your shirt on.
 Right. Of course.
Bye, babe.
She's a live one.
Shit. Now I'm late.
For what?
Nothing. It's silly. I'll tell you later.
I love mysterious Rebecca.
Hey, guys. Are we sure that Zava has the right address?
I'd hate to think he's sitting in the middle of Virginia right now waiting on us, you know?
So, I just talked to legal about Zava's contract.
An e-signature is 100% binding.
Tiny wrinkle, instead of signing his name, he signed "You're welcome." Shit. What are we going to do?
Hey, look, superstars play by their own rules.
Back in '98, I waited over three hours for Public Enemy to take the stage of this joint called The Cubby Bear.
When a man with a giant clock around his neck is that late, it ain't about time.
He's making a statement.
Right, I'm calling it. We're going to go upstairs and figure out what we do next.
Leslie, I want you to talk to the crowd and tell them something.
Of course, Rebecca. I got this.
Back in uni, my deejay name was Damage Control.
I didn't know you deejayed.
I didn't actually, but I had the name ready if I ever started.
 Shit. Right, come on, let's go.
 Yeah.
Welcome to the Dogtrack.
Who the fuck are you?
I can't believe this is happening. Why does anyone put up with this lunatic?
Because as humans, we adapt to accommodate genius.
Who is the greatest actor alive?
Or was, before he retired.
 Daniel Day-Lewis.
 Tony Curtis.
You said alive? Jackie Chan. Wait, you said retired? Daniel Day-Lewis.
Exactly. When he gets in character, he stays in character, and everyone else adapts to him.
Did you know, that when he made Lincoln he actually texted Sally Field as Abraham Lincoln?
Well, that's ridiculous. Abraham Lincoln couldn't text.
Exactly. Every time he looked down at his phone, his hat would fall off.
Look, this Zava might be a genius, but he's definitely a self-absorbed prick.
Your desk is covered in biscuit crumbs.
What the fuck are you doing? We've waited two hours for you.
Time is a construct, like gender and many of the alphabets.
Get out of my chair!
This is your manager.
Hey, how you doing? I'm Ted Lasso.
My leader, I am an empty vessel filled with gold.
I am your rock. Mold me.
Well, hey, if you score goals like you talk, we gonna be just fine, buddy.
Right. And this is Keeley Jones.
 She handles all our publicity.
 Hi.
My queen.
My actions today have made your job much more difficult.
No, don't worry about it. No such thing as bad press, right?
My integrity disallows me to agree with that statement.
 For God's sake.
 He's allergic to hummus.
 Yeah, I know, I know.
 Oh, my God. You're here.
And you are there.
And this is Leslie Higgins, our director of football.
You are the glue.
Thank you very much.
I will go see the team now.
Do you even know where you're going?
I do not!
Are you kidding me? Wowie zowie.
You know what, maybe I oughta tag along in case he gets nervous.
Seems like he can be a little bit of a wallflower.
Great. And now I'm in a rush.
Leslie, tell me, how did the damage control go?
 It was a mess, but he was adorable.
 Thank you.
 Who is this?
 This is Shandy. We work together.
And she's a great friend of mine.
 Hey, did Zava come through here?
 He's here? You saw him?
Yeah, he was upstairs just a second ago.
 What? He's here?
 He's here!
 In this building?
 Yes. He should be here.
Oh, my God.
Okay, maybe we should all just split up and go-- Oy.
He touched me.
He's like an angel.
Why are you downgrading him? He is clearly a god.
I will begin by addressing the most important person in this room.
Which of you is the kit man?
Yeah, he usually-- That's me. I'm Will.
I am...
 Will.
 Yep.
I too worked as a ball boy for a club when I was just 11 years old.
I'm 25.
Your passion...
is why I play.
And you.
My team.
My brothers.
Breathe with me.
Right now? Okay, here we go.
We are now one.
There is no me.
There is no you.
There is only the "we"...
and the "us." And the we in us.
Okay, so...
Okay.
Coaches, let's go in here, have a word really quickly, before he scurries off.
Everybody else, just go ahead and keep breathing amongst yourselves.
He's so much more down-to-earth than I imagined.
 Right?
 Wow.
Which one of these is me?
You're the fucking coach.
You know what, we were thinking the top right.
 Fuck's sake.
 Or left, or left, or left.
Whichever one you want really.
I am very excited to be here.
 Hey, we're very excited--  I will see you tomorrow.
Yep.
He's tall.
Rebecca?
 Tish. Hello there.
 Come in.
Come through.
Please make yourself at home.
Yeah, just take a seat. Relax.
Would you like something to drink?
Water? Tea? Or cocktail, perhaps?
Sure, I'll have a White Russian, thanks.
Yeah, I'm afraid I'm fresh out of Kahlúa after hosting a Big Lebowski themed birthday party for a colleague.
But would straight vodka suffice?
I was literally just making a joke.
I know. Which is why I made two.
You have been through a lot recently.
The dark soul of one man just disconnected you from your own.
And then another beautiful and worthy soul, in a man half your age, arrived exactly at the right time. And the wrong time.
Sorry, how do you know that?
Well, I speak to your mother once a month for the last six years.
So, Rebecca, how can I help you?
I'm not sure you can.
A skeptic. Well, I shouldn't be surprised.
Because you're supposed to be a psychic?
Oh, no.
Because your mother was a skeptic.
Are you familiar with kintsugi?
It's the Japanese art of mending broken things with gold.
It-- The idea is that we embrace the flaws and the imperfections, and in doing so create something much stronger and more beautiful.
So...
we are going to place our hands on the bowl.
Would you?
Sorry, what's that-- Smells very odd in here all of a sudden.
Thank you.
Let's begin.
I can see something.
It's in your hand. An object. It's very special.
Is it a bowl?
It's a green matchbook.
Sorry, it's what?
A green matchbook. How lovely.
Sorry, who cares about a green matchbook?
Now I can hear something.
Shite!
Oh, for God's sake.
No, just one at a time, please.
I-- Shite in wh-- Shite in nin-- Sh-- Yeah, shite in nining armor.
"A shite in nining armor"?
 Does that mean something to you?
 Yes, it does mean something to me.
It means you're even more batshit crazy than I-- Shut up, I can hear something else. It's thunder and lightning and you.
And you're upside down, and you're drenched.
But you're safe.
Okay, that-- that's enough I think for today.
But thank you so much for your time and for sharing your, what is it, your gift?
We can just tell my mum I did the whole session. Yes?
You will have a family.
Sorry, what did you just say?
You're going to be a mother.
Fuck you.
I've always thought you were completely harmless because my mum could afford you, but you are actually dangerous.
And you're fucking cruel.
So, boys, exciting stuff.
We've got a lot of interview requests coming in for all of you.
I'd love to get the word out about the restaurant.
Well, right now the press would like to focus on Zava joining the team.
Yeah, okay.
I would rather talk about Zava than myself any day.
What do you want us to say?
Well, that's up to you. Go for it. Say anything.
I would just, you know, stay positive, light. Right?
Or say something so shocking your interview goes viral.
Like you eat your own hair.
No, I-- Well... Hi, Roy.
Keeley, sorry to interrupt.
No.
Higgins told me to check in on some dumb interview shit.
I mean, some important interview shit.
Don't worry, nobody in the press wants to talk to you.
No, no. That's not actually true.
The press knows that Roy doesn't love doing interviews.
Yeah, but it's okay. I'll do one for you if you need me to.
 Thanks, Roy.
 I'll interview you.
Why'd you dump my friend?
<i>Ay, ay, ay.</i> You're fun.
Who the fuck is this?
This is Shandy. We work together.
 Why?
 She's an old friend of mine.
That makes more sense.
Shandy. I definitely told you about her.
Oh, yeah. Shandy.
You used to eat your own hair, right?
Yeah. I did.
Well, nice to put a face to the hair.
Hey, Coach.
What's today's Wordle?
 Ethic.
 Ethic.
You're a jerk.
 Hey, Jamie. How you doing?
 Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, you can talk to me as long as you want.
Though I do have a tendency to doze off around 1:00 a. m.
 What's up?
 So look-- I know we're all excited Zava's here.
Yeah, I get that. But I know a lot of players like him, and they're all just self-absorbed glory hunters who only care about themselves.
Jamie, don't you think that coming from you that's a little bit ironic?
Don't know.
But look, the point is, we don't need this guy.
I think we've got a good thing going here, and he's already fucking it all up.
Hey, Jamie, I hear what you're saying, man.
But I think we've got to give it a game or two and see what's what.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, yeah. Course, yeah.
Well, thanks for hearing me out.
Aight. Thanks for speaking your mind. Please continue to do so.
Yeah.
And-- And I-- I weren't being ironic, I was being hypocritical. That's it.
Is that right?
 Yes or no?
 Yes.
So that was actually ironic.
<i>Good afternoon. There is an electricity today at Nelson Road,</i> and the cause of all this excitement goes by one name, Zava.
Like Pelé, if every letter was different.
There are more VIPs here than London Fashion Week.
I assume. I don't know.
This is all 'cause you got Zava, babe.
You've made Richmond fucking global.
All right. Pop quiz, hotshots.
What do you get when you combine one of Hugh Jackman's finest film roles with a fancy-pants New York City getaway?
Jean Valjean Catskills?
No. That's a great answer, Sam. How do you know about the Catskills?
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.
Yeah. That's a good show.
Yeah. I respect that. Word.
No, the answer I was looking for actually was today's opponents, Wolverhampton.
 Full name, Wolverhampton Wanderers.
 Thank you.
 Also known as the Wanderers.
 No.
Also known as Wolves.
Okay. So, our opponents today are the Wolverhampton Wandering Wolves.
 No.
 Just Wolverhampton or Wolves.
Got it. So when the team known as Wolverhampton, or Wolves, is wandering around the pitch today trying to score some soccer goals, here's the game plan.
Take it away, fellas.
All right, here's your starters. Here's your subs.
Now remember, this 4-5-1 is not about dropping back.
It's about getting fucking service into the box for Zava.
Got it?
Are you all right?
I am still a strong and capable man.
You're all right.
 All free kicks will be taken by...
 Zava.
 All penalties...
 Zava.
 All corners...
 Anyone to Zava.
That's it. You fellas set 'em up, and our man Zava's gonna-- Well, he's gonna knock 'em down. Okay? Yeah.
Okay. Let's bring it in. Come on. Here.
Zava.
Zava.
Am I supposed to hit the gong or something?
What's up with that shit?
No.
Okay.
I am ready.
Okay. Nicely done.
Okay. Here we go.
All right. Okay, Captain, why don't you go ahead and flip it-- Richmond on three. One, two, three.
Richmond!
He's strong.
Yeah.
 The Precious Moments figurine.
 Little bitch.
 How much time we got, Coach?
 Exactly four minutes.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna call Henry real quick. Wish him luck.
His soccer team starts the playoffs today.
 Nice.
 Yeah.
 Uh-oh.
 What's wrong?
I can't find my phone.
Shoot, I know where it is.
I left it sitting on my bathroom sink. Dang it.
That's what you get for playing Tetris on the toilet.
Yeah, that and numb legs.
You know, that's all right, I'll persevere. I'll go old school.
 Uh-oh.
 What now?
I can't remember Michelle's cell phone number.
Yeah.
 Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
 I think it's just a thing.
Well, yeah.
 You okay?
 Yeah. No, no.
I'll just call the house. No, I-- No, I'm good. I'll be right out.
Henry, we gotta go! And don't forget your shin guards!
Okay!
 Thanks again for driving.
 Yeah, no problem.
 You still have a landline?
 Yeah. I don't know why.
Are you gonna answer it?
No. It's probably a telemarketer.
Henry, let's go!
May I answer it?
I have a thing for messing with telemarketers.
 Knock yourself out.
 Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Watch this.
Hello. You've reached the house of Michelle Keller.
Who by the way is doing amazing things with orange slices these days.
You're gonna be amazed. It's really spectacular.
How can I help you?
Well, hey, Mr. Former President.
Boy, have I got a bone to pick with you.
<i>Hello?</i> <i>Hello?</i> Ted.
 Yeah. Who is this?
 This is Jacob Bryanson.
Dr. Jacob?
<i>Yeah. Ted, you can just call me Jake.</i> Dr. Jacob.
Henry, come on!
Michelle. Michelle.
 What?
 It's Ted.
Shit.
 Hi, Ted.
 Hey.
Found 'em!
Hey, sweetie. Do you want to talk to Daddy really quick?
 Dad.
 Hey, buddy.
We're playing the Dragons today, and they're undefeated.
Yeah, well, you know they ain't gonna be undefeated for long. Am I right?
Hey, look, I was just calling to wish you good luck.
Good luck to you too, Dad.
And please tell Zava that many of my friends' moms like his abs.
Will do.
 Bye.
 Bye.
Thank you, sweetie.
Ted, just one second, okay?
<i>Do you wanna wait in the car?</i>  Do you wanna take him to the-- Thank you.
 Yes. Of course. Come on, bud.
<i>You ever seen a sunroof? Pretty cool.</i> Hi. Sorry.
<i>Can we chat when we both have more time?</i> <i>There's a lot to catch up on.</i> Yeah. No, of course.
All good. I'll talk to you later.
<i>Ted, I-- Good luck today.</i> Thanks.
<i>The Richmond faithful return to their beloved Dogtrack</i> <i>for the first time this Premier League season,</i> <i>and surely when they see the name Zava on the team sheet,</i> <i>they'll think they've died and gone to heaven.</i> Come on! Let's go! Let's do it!
Tartt.
What's he doing now?
Yeah?
Get open. I will find you.
Come on, boys! Come on!
Let's go, boys.
<i>My word, he's done it!</i> <i>Zava has scored from the halfway line seconds into his debut,</i> <i>and the Dogtrack is in a state of rapture.</i>  Yeah. All right.
 He might be pretty good.
 Here we go.
 I could get used to this shit.
 Zava! Zava!
 Yes. Yes. Yay.
<i>Bumbercatch with the cross. It's a tricky one for Zava.</i>  I cannot believe what I just saw.
 What?
<i>Zava with the scorpion kick, and Burnley feel the sting.</i> Om.
Om.
<i>Richmond up 2-nil over Palace, who have simply had no answer for Zava.</i> <i>The corner comes in,</i> <i>And it's that man again! Zava, with a towering header!</i> <i>Soaring like an eagle amongst penguins.</i>  How do you do?
 Morning.
I think it's good.
And then maybe do a-- I think we should put it in. Do you think we should?
<i>Rojas finds Tartt.</i> <i>Still seeking his first goal of the season, is this the moment?</i> <i>No, it's Zava again!</i> Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava!
<i>He may have stolen the goal from Jamie Tartt,</i> <i>but you can't argue with the instincts of a champion.</i> <i>If you're a Richmond fan,</i> <i>you've gotta feel that with Zava everything is going your way.</i> I got a job!
Thank you.
I mean, the whole thing is just crazy, you know.
He was supposed to be helping us get back together.
You know what I mean?
It always bothered me the way he'd be like, "I'm sorry, our time is up." <i>Sorry, our time is up.</i> Nah, that's not quite it. It was a lot more condescending.
It was more like, "I'm so sorry." <i>Ted, I'm talking about our session. Our time is up.</i> Oh, right. Sorry I didn't get to ask any personal questions.
I was just yammering.
Wow. Gone. Okay.
Gotta respect it.
George, is Ted Lasso the coach of the year?
What? Writing the name Zava on the team sheet?
Come on. Gimme a break, Jeff. That's not coaching.
No. What Nathan Shelley's doing over at West Ham, now that is a tactician at work.
Yeah, I like West Ham.
But I love Zava.
Don't we all, mate?
<i>We're in stoppage time of what has been an unforgettable contest.</i> <i>Richmond surely would be happy with a draw,</i> <i>but here's Rojas with a chance to steal an historic victory</i> <i>over Manchester United.</i> <i>Zava with a God-like bicycle kick in injury time.</i> <i>And surely Richmond have won it.</i> <i>A Zava hat trick bringing their first ever victory in the Theatre of Dreams.</i> Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Fuck it!
<i>And with this victory over Brentford</i> <i>that's six wins on the bounce for Richmond</i> <i>in this Zava-fueled miracle streak.</i> You ever think your book would be a fucking fairy tale?
Come on!
Yo! Yo, yo, yo! Hey! Guys, guys, guys. Yo, yo. Check it out.
Listen. Tomorrow, everybody is invited to the restaurant.
We're still a few weeks from officially opening.
So please, lower your expectations.
But it's gonna be an open bar!
Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava!
 Okay. Okay. What do I need? Hey.
 Hey. Don't serve my food with that face.
Okay.
Oh, man.
 Hey.
 Sam, this place is lovely.
 Have a great night.
 Thank you. Nice seeing you.
 Super great place.
 Yeah.
Thank you. I'll come and catch you, yeah?
 Peace.
 All right. I'll see you later.
 Hello. Okay. This is for you.
 The smell.
 That's for you.
 Nice.
Mate, this is the best moimoi I've ever tasted in my life.
Thanks, man.
 Look at me. I'm not kidding.
 Hey.
Thank you. Thanks.
Sam, is Zava coming? I made him a friendship bracelet.
Well, I invited him. I guess we'll see.
Cool, man.
Okay, you guys. Enjoy the food, okay?
 All right?
 Cool, bro.
 Colin.
 Hi, hi.
 Doing good?
 Yeah, you okay?
Boyos, this is my pal Michael.
 Hiya.
 What's up, man?
 World's greatest wingman.
 Yeah. Tough gig.
"Hello, young lady. My friend's a professional footballer.
May I spend all night talking to your cross-eyed friend while he hits on you poorly?" What did you decide after Tish's reading?
 Are you gonna go back and see her?
 No. No, no.
It's not for me. If I wanted to be scammed out of all my money, I'd go the old-fashioned route and become obsessively religious.
Cheers to that.
Well, if it isn't Beauty and the Stink!
Get out! Sassy!
Oh, my God!
Hey, ladies.
 Hi.
 Welcome to Ola's.
 I'm so happy to see all of you.
 Thanks for having us, Sam.
No, thank you for coming. Please, make sure you enjoy yourselves, okay?
 Absolutely. Thanks.
 Cheers!
Thank you.
You are such a twat.
 Oi. What can I get you to drink?
 Champagne, please.
Champagne? Can we get another champagne?
Is Ted here?
Told you.
You want a beer, Coach?
Michelle and Henry went horseback riding with Dr. Jacob today.
We'll take two shots of whiskey. A single and a double.
A triple. Two.
Weinstein's cock!
Are you cheating on me?
Yeah, I am.
With you.
Man, y'all's baggage just matches right up, don't it?
See you in a bit.
What the fuck do you want?
You frowning while we're on a win streak, that's a bad look.
You frowned your whole career.
No, I never smiled. That's different.
Here we go.
 Good game. Good game.
 Yes.
For fuck's sake.
There he is, God's gift to those who have everything.
Best player on the team.
Fuck off.
It's true.
You used to be the best. Now you're not. It happens.
You thought I was the best?
Yeah. I mean, you still could be if you weren't such a pre-Madonna.
 Did you just call me a pre-Madonna?
 Yeah.
It's prima donna.
Who the fuck says "pre-Madonna"? What the fuck does that even mean?
It means before Madonna, female vocalists didn't have to work that hard.
Are you mad?
You never heard of Tina Turner? Fucking Stevie Nicks?
Fuck you. Point is, he's the best player on the team.
And right now, all you gotta do is try and keep up with him.
Fuck that. I don't wanna just keep up with him.
I wanna be better than him.
I could train you.
But only if you fucking mean it.
Yeah. I do mean it.
When do we start then?
Right fucking now.
Come on, man.
So sorry. We'll take care of it.
We start tomorrow. 4:00 a. m.
Clean that up.
All right.
I'm gonna do a lap. If Ted's already gone, I'm telling you right now, I will be attempting to scale Mount Zava.
Adieu.
Adieu. Good luck.
Hi. Hello. Hi.
Hi. Hello.
I'm Shandy. I do PR for the club.
It's so great you've come down here, but don't be a dick.
Show some love on your socials, yeah?
I like your confident energy. It's off-putting.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
That's really nice.
So how's it going with Shandy? Is she fitting in?
Yes, she's great. I love how not shy she is.
Yeah.
Wish me luck.
Okay. See you later.
Oi. There are better things ahead than any we leave behind.
Excuse me. One moment.
Hey, hey.
Thank you so much for coming. Honestly, it means so much to me.
Sam, tell me, where does your restaurant source its avocados from?
West African cuisine doesn't typically feature a lot of avocados.
Not yet.
 Marlboro Man.
 Hey. Look who it is.
I didn't know you work here.
Well, how you going?
 I'm doing all right. Yeah.
 Yeah?
Well, my ex-wife's dating our ex-marriage counselor, so, you know, that's new.
Wow, that's borderline unethical.
Yeah, well, I mean, it all started a year and a half after we were seeing him, so I guess that's-- You ever have anything like that happen with you and a client?
Ted, I'm a child psychologist.
Right, right.
So, yes. Twice.
Hey. Classic Sassy. I love it.
 Classic Sass.
 Classic Sassy.
I got you a surprise.
What's this?
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Don't just stand there. Pass them out.
Hey.
 What?
 You're being really clingy right now.
I am so sorry.
Hey.
Ladies, a little something to commemorate the evening and to remind you to come back again and again, right?
Thank you.
No worries.
So chic.
Green.
It's a green matchbook.
You okay?
 Yes. Another round?
 All right. Yeah. Okay.
 Get another round.
 Can we get another round, please?
 Thank you, Sam.
 No worries.
This place is wonderful.
 Food's fantastic.
 Thank you so much for coming.
 Okay, listen, get home safe, okay?
 Okay.
 
@@@@@@
Fucking hell.
All right, let's go.
It's 4:00 a. m.
Yeah. We start at 4:00 a. m.
I thought you were joking.
How is that a joke?
'Cause it's 4:00 a. m.
We start at 4:00, so you can do three workouts a day instead of two.
Okay, but it's 4:00 a. m.
Do you wanna be better than Zava or not?
Well, how are we gonna see? It's dark out.
Fucking hell.
Now get dressed. Or I start flicking your balls.
This is perverse.
Whoops.
There you go.
Good morning, Sassy Smurf.
Good morning, Marlboro Man.
You know, you snored all night.
I'm sorry about that.
That's all right. It's actually very soothing.
Sounded like the sea.
Well, I'm glad you didn't hear any boat horns, given all the fried yams I ate last night.
Hey, I was thinking. We have a good time together, yeah?
They're called simultaneous orgasms, Ted, yes.
Yeah, well, but I mean also all the talking and laughing and all that stuff. Yeah?
Sure. Well, apart from all your dreadful puns.
Right. Well, it's tough.
Sometimes I just see 'em there, and I gotta take a swing at 'em, you know?
No, I-- Well, what I'm getting at is...
Well, I was just thinking maybe...
we could go on an actual date sometime.
You know? You and me, together.
God, no.
Well, I appreciate you taking the time to consider it.
Ted, we can't date.
Why not?
 You're a mess.
 I'm a mess?
Course you are.
I'm a mess too, but I'm a mess three years further on than you, so I'm more of a slight disarray.
More like a slight disarray of sunshine, if you ask me.
Oh, God.
 Sorry.
 Ted, on the day my ex got remarried, I drank a bottle of red wine through a straw and told my Uber driver I was in love with him.
Then, when he dropped me home, I puked so much, my mouth was like an elevator from the goddamn Shining.
Knocked my rating down to a 3.9.
3.9?
Fuck you. Why? What's yours?
Oh, God, you're a five, aren't you?
Course you're a five. How the fuck are you a five?
Course you're a five. How the fuck are you a five?
I don't know. I'm tidy. I say "Please" and "Thank you." Sometimes I offer to drive if they look tired.
You are such a mess.
Ted, I like our status.
Friends with benefits, like Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher.
No. I think you're thinking of 2011's other good-friends-turned-casual-lovers based rom-com.
No Strings Attached.
Friends with Benefits was Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.
Wow. 2011, friends be fuckin'.
Yeah.
So, let's keep things 2011. Cool and breezy.
Like an Arab Spring.
And good luck against West Ham this weekend.
Fuck Rupert and that shriveled raisin-pouch he calls a nutsack.
Hello! Here for Flo?
 You can jump in, love.
 Lovely, thank you.
This is nice. Gray seats? Yes, please.
<i>... West Ham. This is the real opportunity</i> <i>for the Wonder Kid to become the Wonder Man...</i> 101.
100.
Ninety-nine.
Why do you only sleep with a top on?
Because I get cold upstairs and hot downstairs.
I get that.
Mornin'.
Listen to what Rupert said in this one.
"I truly look forward to seeing my old club again.
Richmond are top-class."  What a soggy, wet piece of shit.
 Thank you.
Right, I'm off to the training ground. Thanks again for the opportunity.
Babe, you earned it.
Shandy came up with this super fun Bantr promo.
It uses all the single players on the team.
Yeah.
The anonymous man you're Bantr-ing with could be a professional footballer.
That's great.
And that's all the single players, you say?
So, it's, like, Colin and Dani and Sam, et cetera?
Yeah, although I don't think Sam's doing it anymore.
 No.
 So fun.
 Ms. Jones.
 Hello, Barbara.
 All right there, Barbs?
 It's "Barbara."  All right there, Barbs?
 It's "Barbara." If possible, could I get two tickets for the Richmond-West Ham match?
Jack might be coming to London this weekend.
Of course.
Who's Jack?
Jack Danvers.
The head of the VC that funded your company.
Our boss.
Yes. That Jack. Of course.
That's not a problem, Barbara.
I can let you have some seats in my suite.
Lovely.
Thank you so much, Rebecca. That's so kind of you and so efficient.
Keeley.
Thanks, Barbara.
So, the one thing we cannot do against West Ham is the False Nine.
- 'Cause that's Nate's shit.
 Exactly.
So, we decided to go with our classic 4-4-2.
Which is exactly what that prick expects us to do.
So, we do the opposite. Five up front. Full-on attack.
So, we do the opposite. Five up front. Full-on attack.
But Nate knows we're gonna do that, because Nate knows that we're trying to outthink him by thinking like him.
Well, fuck Nate, fuck thinking and fuck fucking Socrates.
So, we gotta stop thinking like Nate and start thinking like Nate would think we would think if Nate were thinking like us, and then do the last thing that Nate thinking like us thinking like Nate thinking like us would ever expect us to do.
Have Zava drop back and play Nate's False Nine.
Voi-fucking-là.
Brilliant.
- It's mostly Beard's idea.
 Nah, it was a group effort.
I do have one question.
- Of course.
 Who fucking cares?
Do you think Zava'll do it?
Fuck!
 Good mornin'.
 Hey.
 Uh-oh, what's wrong?
 Roy doesn't think we can beat Nate.
 Higgins doesn't think so either!
 Beard said it to me first.
 Higgins doesn't think so either!
 Beard said it to me first.
 You throw me under the bus? How dare--  You walked in here this morning-- - You're gonna sell me out?
 Whoa! Whoa.
Y'all pointin' more fingers than Ganesha givin' directions.
Now look, you fellas need to calm down and just kiss.
He's right.
Keep it simple, smartypants.
An answer will show up. Don't worry.
But until it does, here's a question for y'all: Am I a mess?
Sassy ended up spending the night last night and-- No, hush your butts. That ain't the headline.
Well, I asked her out on a proper date this morning.
She turned me down cold. She said I was-- and I quote-- "a mess." - Yeah.
 Sounds like a case for the Diamond Dogs!
Release the hounds.
Yeah, here we go! Let's do it.
Fuck's sakes.
Fuck's sakes.
Yes.
"Yes" what?
 Yes, you're a mess.
Okay. Expound.
We're playing Nate this week, and you're acting like it's not a big deal.
Nothing's different. He didn't hurt you.
Hey, look, we ain't talking about Nate right now.
I'm asking you if you think I'm a mess. All right?
Higgy pie, what do you think?
I think I don't understand how you're not pissed off with Nate.
We have a saying in Co-Dependents Anonymous.
 Y-- What?
 Jane makes me go with her.
Yeah.
Pain is like carbon monoxide.
Expressing it to the person who hurt you is like opening a vent, but holding it in will poison you.
I like that. But Nate didn't hurt me.
Bullshit!
Roy, did you wanna get in on this Diamond Dog situation?
 Hey, Roy! Hey, Roy.
 Hey, Roy. Here, Roy.
Here, Roy. Come here, Roy.
La, la, la, la, la!
So, the match of the week is clearly Richmond and West Ham.
So, the match of the week is clearly Richmond and West Ham.
<i>Now, it's been a strong start to the season for both of these teams,</i> <i>but I think the Hammers are favorites, going into the London derby,</i> <i>based on the tactical acumen of the Wonder Kid, Nathan Shelley.</i> <i>Yeah, Shelley is brilliant, there's no doubt about that,</i> <i>but Zava, he is a genius. I like the Greyhounds for this one.</i> That's my guy!
No, you can't have him. He's mine.
 Let's move on, shall we, to Sunday's--  Hey, look. Guys, guys.
Who cares, right?
Now come on, we've got work to do. Let's go.
He is correct.
We must ignore these talking faces. Even when they are in our favor.
Thank you, "Zorro." Exactly, but it's actually pronounced "Zoreaux." Why?
I don't know. Because that's how my parents say it, I guess?
My friend, you can be whoever you want to be.
My friend, you can be whoever you want to be.
I let all of my children name themselves once they reach the age of seven.
That is why my eldest is called "Smingus Dingus." Dream big, and you may never wake up.
Thank you.
Jesus.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but hey, lads, I agree with Zava.
Yes, it's a big fucking game, but we've just gotta focus, do what we do,  do you know what I mean?
 Yeah. He's right.
And don't forget, yeah?
 Believe in "Believe."  Yes.
What the-- What?
 Oh, shit.
 What?
 Why the fuck did you do that?
 I was just checking if I acquired the ability to chop things in half.
Yeah, and what if you had?
Sorry, bruv. I didn't think it through.
Fellas. Someone ripped this in half.
What the fuck? What?
What the fuck?
You're joking What the fuck?
Hello...
Jade.
Nathan.
Shelley.
Lovely to see you again.
Okay.
Sorry I've not been around much.
Sorry I've not been around much.
You haven't?
No. No, I've been really busy with my new job.
Big new job just keeping me very busy.
Sounds silly. Maybe you should quit your big new busy job.
Anyway, just here to pick up my takeaway.
I bought lunch for my whole staff.
Apart from the trainers, 'cause they eat like cows.
Sorry, that sounds-- No, they're love-- I mean, they're lovely people.
They're just vegetarians.
No way.
Look who's here. No fucking way!
 Do you know who this is?
 Jason Jelly.
 That's right.
 No, "Nathan Shelley." That's right, Nathan Shelley, manager of West Ham United, in my restaurant!
 Big week, my guy.
 Yep.
Big fucking week. I'm Derek. I'm the manager here.
Anything you need, you got it.
Anything you need, you got it.
 Okay.
 From one manager to another.
Yeah, well, it's not quite the same, but-- Facing your team this week.
That's gotta be hard-core, right?
I mean, you talked a lot of shit about them in the press.
 Didn't ya? I loved it.
 Sorry, can I pay?
No. This is on me, okay? On me. Understand?
This man's money is no good here.
Never charge. Except for booze. Gotta charge for booze.
I didn't order any booze. It's 12:30.
Knock 'em dead. Go Hammers!
No way. Oi, do you know who this is?
All right, okay. Bye.
And cut!
Lovely, Colin. Thank you.
All right. Okay, Dani, you're up.
I'm very nervous.
No. Don't be nervous. Look, just sit here. Look into the camera and pretend you're talking to an old friend.
My oldest friend is Javiar.
Great. How long have you known Javiar?
Only a couple of months, but he turns 108 years old next week.
 Perfect.
 Yeah.
Final checks.
Thank you.
 Hello, Keeley.
 Hi.
Yeah. Just scoot to your left a little bit.
Yeah, that's it. Okay, off you go, Dani.
You may not know who I am, but I think the most beautiful parts of a woman are her flaws.
And cut! Thank you, Dani. Next!
Okay.
 Brought you coffee.
 Yeah.
 How's it going?
 Oh, my God. This is great.
 Yeah?
 They're great.
I just-- I love being the boss.
 Cheers to that. Yeah.
 Cheers to that.
You ready, Zoreaux?
Yeah, but I actually go by "Van Damme" now.
Okay, great. Action, Van Damme.
You don't know who I am, but I'm looking for someone who likes short walks on the beach, so we can spend more time, you know...
And cut.
Great, thanks, Van Damme. Next!
 Van Damme?
 Yeah. It's my new name.
Cool. Why?
Because I love Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Zava told me I should be whoever I wanna be.
 Okay, yeah. Cool.
 All right, Van Damme.
 All right, boys.
 Take it easy.
He's so fucking hot.
 What's his story?
 Jamie? He's so cocky.
But I guess you have to be at this level.
But he only thinks about himself.
At least, he used to.
Joking. No.
But he's not accountable for his actions and what they do to others.
Except he is getting better at making apologies.
Still, he only thinks with his dick.
And yet, I don't think he's seen anyone in ages.
I just wanna know if I can bang him, babe.
I don't know.
You should probably ask him, it's his dick.
Cool. Off you go, Jamie.
What are y'all still doing here?
Coach, you're gonna wanna watch this.
Is it one of them videos of a military parent coming home after a long tour?
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be eating tears and snot for dinner.
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be eating tears and snot for dinner.
Not quite.
Here we go.
Where'd this come from?
This fucking legend thought to pull the security footage when we told him about the sign.
when we told him about the sign.
I guess you can take the boy out of journalism but you can't take journalism out of the boy.
Right, you fucking ruined it now. The point is, the answer we were looking for has arrived.
What are you talking about?
A video like this could motivate a team, perhaps.
Thank you for your help, Trent.
May a young Robert Redford portray you in a film someday.
Probably Dustin Hoffman.
 Good night.
 Good night.
Go home, guys. Get some sleep.
Okay.
 Good night, Ted. Night, Beard.
 Good night.
Night, Coach.
Coach.
I was thinking about your Sassy situation.
Yeah.
Jane's sister is in town.
 No, thank you, Coach.
 That's the right answer.
Burning the midnight oil, I see.
Yeah. Sorry for the smell.
The oil burning.
So, you're feeling confident about this weekend?
Yeah, no, I think so.
Yeah, no. Go-- Yeah. We're gonna destroy, right?
Good.
No, it's just, I-- I just haven't seen Ted since I left and...
We didn't leave on the best of terms and...
I feel like I owe him an apology or something.
You did what was best for you.
What were you meant to do?
Hang around, supporting Ted for the rest of your life?
I don't think so.
You've done nothing wrong, Nathan, I promise you.
You earned this job.
Well, so what do I say when I see him?
You say nothing, apart from "hello." You look him in the eye. You shake his hand.
And then you beat him.
And then we go and celebrate.
Okay.
Good night, Nathan.
Good night, Rupert. Thank you.
Mr. Mannion.
Hey.
Working late? Or hardly working?
Well, I don't think that's how the joke goes.
What joke?
Never mind. What's up?
I really want to win this one.
I know.
Everything okay?
Am I a mess?
Of course you are. That's why we get along.
And I wish I could tell you to ignore Sass, but she's usually right.
So, Sassy already told you about the-- Of course. Girl talk.
Girl talk.
So, is everything all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
Oklahoma?
I'm a work in "progmess." Good night, Ted.
You already won, you know?
You got that turkey out of your life.
Beat them.
Good night, boss.
Oi, do I look all right?
Of course you do. Why?
Well, if Jack actually shows up, Well, if Jack actually shows up, I want him to think that I look mysterious and powerful.
Dynamic, you know?
 All of that.
 You are mysterious, powerful and dynamic.
Shit, I'm nervous.
I think I need to go and reapply my lip liner.
 I'll see you upstairs in the suite.
 Yep.
Hey, Rebecca!
 Rupert.
 Wonderful to see you.
 Bex. Love the new hair.
 Hi.
I haven't changed my hair.
Nor should you. It's perfection.
So, how's the little one?
Oh, yeah, Diane. She's already walking. Can you believe that?
Yeah. Drooling and pooing around the house.
Takes after her father.
Well. Hey, take it easy on us today.
No promises.
Oh, shit.
Excuse me.
I've got a bit of a situation here.
Thank you. But it's actually not that.
You're a lifesaver!
Usually I'm like clockwork, but because I've been so stressed, I've come on early.
I'm so happy that it's a super and not a skinny.
Who are those even for?
It's not like my vagina is on a diet, I'm on my fucking period.
Oi, thanks for helping me.
And I love your shoes!
 Yeah. Thanks. Pay it forward.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Thanks. Pay it forward.
 Yeah.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Hi.
Boy, you're tall.
Is your dad a tree or something?
No, I'm screwing around.
Hey, speaking of trees, who are y'all rooting for today?
West Ham.
Yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah.
Go ahead. Yeah. Going down one more floor.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, of course.
Best of luck out there.
Hey, Nate. That you?
Hi. I didn't see you there.
 That's okay. How you been, man?
 Yeah, okay.
Yeah. Good.
Listen, Ted.
I just wanna say that the way I left-- Nathan. There you are.
Yeah.
Hey, Rupert.
 Ted.
 Nice to see you again.
Good luck.
 Keeley? Yeah.
 She's absolutely fantastic.
Here she is now.
 Hey. Yeah.
 Keeley? This is Jack Danvers.
Hello.
I believe you have something of mine.
Oh, fuck. You're Jack?
Oh, fuck. You're Jack?
This is a bit embarrassing.
 No.
 Yeah. We all thought you were a man.
Yeah, that too.
It's like that old riddle.
 What riddle?
 You know, always a tricky one, this one.
A father and son are in a car wreck.
Dad dies instantly, the son is rushed to an emergency room.
A surgeon walks in and says, "I can't operate on this boy. He's my son." How is it possible?
 Because she's a woman.
 She's gay.
 Sperm donor.
 He lives in a simulation?
Right. Yeah, I guess that's a bit dated now.
So, I assume "Jack" is short for "Jacqueline," right?
No. It's short for my father wanted a boy.
I'm gonna go and sit down now, outside. Now.
Jack, welcome.
We are not allowed to take drinks to our seats.
So if you want to get plastered, we should probably do that now.
Okay.
Well, after you.
You're so funny, Rebecca.
Barbara's obsessed with Rebecca.
I hope she doesn't try and kill her and wear her skin as a suit.
What the fuck?
Cheers. It's gonna be a good day.
 All right, Baz.
 Oi!
This is a Richmond pub.
It's all right, Mae. He's with me.
Get the fuck out!
Come on, Richmond!
Come on, Richmond! Come on, Richmond!
<i>It's a full house for today's battle</i> <i>between West Ham United and Zava's AFC Richmond.</i> <i>A win would take either team to the top spot in the table,</i> <i>knocking mighty Manchester City off number one.</i> Should be a tight match, Chris. Any predictions?
I stopped making predictions, Arlo.
I stopped making predictions, Arlo.
Because I was never wrong.
Got to the point I was worried I was the one making things happen.
Well, that's interesting.
I knew you'd say that.
<i>They fade and die</i> <i>Fortune's always hiding</i> <i>I've looked everywhere</i> <i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i> <i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i> United! United!
United! United!
United! United!
Nate.
Let's have fun out there today, yeah?
<i>West Ham are quite happy to just soak up the pressure.</i> <i>Not taking any risks at all against Richmond,</i> <i>of all teams, at home.</i>  A sign of how far Richmond have come.
 It's all right. We're okay.
<i>What a threat Zava is.</i> Richmond! To the right! Tight! Don't get scared.
<i>And it stays nil-nil, thanks to an amazing save by Zoreaux.</i>  Van Damme.
 Van Damme!
I hear he wants to be called "Van Damme" now.
Why?
Well, we'd probably have to dive into his childhood for that answer.
<i>Richmond need the key pass to unlock the Hammers' defense.</i> <i>That could be the one.</i>  Tartt hits the woodwork.
 No!
 That was close.
 Zava was wide open.
For Zava!
<i>There'll be two more minutes in the first half of this scoreless,</i> <i>There'll be two more minutes in the first half of this scoreless,</i> <i>but pulsating, London derby.</i>  Obisanya caught in possession.
 No.
<i>And here come West Ham on the break.</i> <i>Armando bearing down on goal.</i>  Yeah!
 Yes!
<i>And it's there. Right under Van Damme.</i> <i>The Canadian keeper apparently not as unstoppable</i> <i>as the Muscles from Brussels.</i> <i>That's not fair, Arlo. Nobody is.</i>  We've been here before. Come on.
 Come on, lads.
<i>The Hammers go up 1-nil just before halftime.</i> Fuck it.
All right, guys. Come on, now. Let's end this half strong!
Huddle.
What's this shit?
I don't know.
 Lower. Move it right. Five.
 Brilliant.
 Right now, come on. Five.
 Ref, just blow the fucking whistle.
<i>West Ham pressing now.</i>  No.
 A new tactic from the Hammers <i>in the closing seconds of the first half.</i> <i>in the closing seconds of the first half.</i> <i>It's never too late to change, Arlo.</i>  No!
 Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck!
<i>And it's 2-nil. Oh, deary me.</i> Excuse me.
How did that happen?
<i>We go to halftime.</i> <i>Richmond have dominated possession,</i> <i>but out of absolutely nowhere, it's 2-nil to the Hammers.</i> We don't deserve that.
What the fuck just happened?
I don't know.
Hey, fellas. I'll be right back. Okay?
The fuck are you going?
 I'll just be a minute or two, okay?
 What do we tell the team?
I don't know. Surprise me.
Hey, boss. What you doing down here?
I just wanted to tell you that I believe in you, Ted.
Uh-huh?
And I know that I've been putting an awful lot of pressure on you And I know that I've been putting an awful lot of pressure on you to win today, but I just want you to forget all about that.
Just be yourself and have fun.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
Okay. Well, thank you.
I believe in you, Ted.
And it's intense.
 I better go. All right.
 Off you pop.
Remember, have fun!
Yes! This is so exciting!
No.
This is your surprise, huh?
A minute ago, they were catatonic. Now look at them.
 They're killers.
 Frankly, Ted, sometimes that's good.
 They're killers.
 Frankly, Ted, sometimes that's good.
<i>Oh, my. Richmond coming out of the tunnel</i> <i>with a palpable chip on their shoulder.</i> <i>Wow. A real tension on the pitch. I think we're in for an exciting half.</i> <i>We begin the second half with Richmond looking for a strong start.</i>  Come on, boys. Fucking kill 'em.
 Fucking kill 'em.
 Here we go!
 Kill!
<i>That's an awful tackle.</i>  He would be fortunate to escape...
 Oh, fuck.
<i>... with just a yellow.</i> <i>It's a deserved red, and Richmond</i> <i>will play almost the entire second half with ten men.</i> He's actually a very sweet young man.
<i>Here come West Ham.</i> <i>And now Van Damme has been sent off.</i> <i>And now Van Damme has been sent off.</i>  We're playing like Italians.
 I know.
It's awesome.
Oh, dear.
<i>It's getting a touch spicy out there.</i> <i>Spicy, Arlo? This is vintage vindaloo.</i> No.
<i>Montlaur has lost his mind, and Richmond have lost a third player.</i> Fucking come on.
<i>Richmond have completely lost the plot.</i> <i>Richmond have completely lost the plot.</i> <i>Zava must be wondering what he's done to deserve this.</i> Yes!
<i>And it's 4-1 to the Hammers.</i> <i>It went from evenly matched to unevenly matched</i> <i>to light a match on fire and put it into a can of petrol.</i> <i>That second half should've come with a trigger warning.</i> <i>One extraordinary goal by Zava did not make it any less tough to watch.</i> <i>Richmond showed a side of themselves we've never seen before.</i> <i>They played angry, dirty and ugly.</i> <i>Which are also the names of Zava's three youngest kids.</i> Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
 Hey, it's okay.
 Shit.
Did you guys have fun?
Yeah.
The violence was quite entertaining, wasn't it? In a way.
Sending off Van Damme was a mistake.
He played with passion.
"Passion" is a word we use when we talk about love.
It is also a word we use to describe a crime.
Sometimes it is also a fruit.
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.
 We fucked up.
 We overcorrected and played with hate.
 Be great if you yelled at us a bit.
 Please.
 Call us pieces of shit or something.
 Now.
 Call us pieces of shit or something.
 Now.
You can hit us.
Get it over with.
Tried something new. It didn't work. Big whoop.
I will take that thumb drive one of y'all's got.
Shake it off, fellas. Lot of football left this season.
 What a fucking arsehole.
 I know.
You have to feel pretty good about yourself after that win, yeah?
Well, yeah. Richmond were clearly rattled.
It was easier than I expected, if I'm honest.
What about Ted?
Quite a snub not to shake his hand at the end of the game.
Did I not? I didn't mean to.
I-- Guess I just got caught up in the excitement of it all. Yeah.
Excuse me a minute. I just...
Coach Shelley, Mr. Mannion asked me to give you this.
He'll meet you there in an hour.
Thank--  It's so good to see you, Rebecca.
 You too, Bex.
Oh, Rebecca, my dear.
 So sorry for your loss.
 Thank you.
Come on, old man. It's way past your bedtime.
Lovely to see you.
I saw you with your assistant.
Your daughter deserves better, and so does Bex.
Stop fucking around.
Stop fucking around.
Here you go.
We are normally a lot better than that. And nicer.
Well, it's never great when your team gets more red cards than goals, is it?
No.
What a shit show.
Anyway, good news. Bantr's trending.
 It is?
 Yeah.
Pretty sure the change to the bio line helped.
What are you talking about?
Who did this?
I did. This afternoon, when I uploaded the vids.
You're welcome.
 Shandy.
 Yeah.
This is the opposite of what Bantr is trying to do.
Are you joking? They're gonna love it.
I've literally tripled their subscribers in an hour.
You need to change this back, now. Please.
You need to change this back, now. Please.
Yeah.
It was really lovely to meet you.
 You too.
 Excuse me.
Hey. Here he is!
The Wonder Kid himself.
The man of the hour!
Thank you very much, Mr. Mannion.
Please, no. "Rupert." Nathan.
Thanks, Ms. Kakes. That's...
And Nathan, allow me to introduce Anastasia.
Huge fan.
Oh, my God. You're famous.
So are you.
Congratulations to your victory.
Yeah. Thank you.
Come on, Tartt! One more before dinner!
Let's go, Coach.
<i>That was hard to watch.</i> <i>Thierry, West Ham's domination today saw Ted Lasso being totally exposed</i> <i>by his former assistant Nate Shelley.</i> <i>Gary, I love this quote from a Chinese philosopher, Laozi,</i> <i>"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.</i> <i>When the student is truly ready, the teacher will disappear."</i> <i>The Greyhounds...</i>  Hi, Ted.
 Hey.
<i>Sorry about the match.</i> No. That's all right. It was a tough one.
<i>Henry's not here right now. He's at a birthday party,</i>  but I'll--  No, that's okay.
I was actually hoping just to chat with you. You got a minute?
<i>Sure. Is everything okay?</i> Yeah. Well-- No. You know, I just...
I wanted to say something real quick.
Look, I...
I know that you and I aren't, you know, together anymore.
And I respect that. Okay? I do.
But, Well, you know, this whole thing with you and Dr. Jacob really ticks me off.
And I'm upset that we didn't ever really get to talk about it before it all started.
Yeah.
And look, I understand that me saying all this, might be the wrong thing to do, but...
I just feel like not saying it...
isn't the...
Well, wouldn't be the right thing either.
'Cause we gotta raise this little boy together, you know?
We're stuck with each other. We're gonna share grandkids.
I love you, Michelle.
And I love Henry.
And I love our family.
And I love our family.
No matter what it looks like.
Okay?
<i>Of course.</i> Well, I'll talk to y'all soon.
Have a good night. Tell Henry I love him.
<i>Good night, Ted.</i> 
@@@@@@
<i>And with this loss,</i> <i>Richmond's dreary winless streak continues.</i> <i>Another two goals for Zava are not enough</i> <i>as Newcastle dismantle the Greyhounds 4-2.</i> <i>The talent is clearly on the field, Chris.</i> <i>It sure is, Arlo.</i> <i>The problem with this team might be in the dugout.</i> Damn it!
Fuck.
Chris, since their loss to Nathan Shelley and West Ham last month, it seems the Greyhounds have been dropping like a stone.
Well, all objects drop at the same rate, Arlo. Except feathers.
Well said, Chris. When Zava arrived, it was sunny days.
<i>But now, if you're a Richmond fan,</i> <i>you've got to feel like nothing is going your way.</i> Boo! Boo!
<i>Things go from bad to worse</i> <i>as Richmond welcome Manchester City mid-week.</i> <i>They are not in form to finally crack the code against their sky-blue tormentors</i> <i>as they fall to ninth place.</i> I knew positive thinking was bullshit!
 Oh. Wow, that's not very nice.
 What?
"Even with Zava, Richmond eat more arse than your mum." Buddy, you gotta get off Twitter.
This is a text from my father.
Oh, boy. I just don't get it.
You know?
The effort was there, as always. We just can't get over that hump.
I don't know what the heck the problem is. Do you guys?
 Our defense is in shambles.
 Our offense is stale.
And if the boys are gonna fucking stand around watching fucking Zava all fucking match, we should make them buy fucking tickets.
Okay, so some constructive criticism.
 I appreciate that.
 Mmm.
Hey, Boss. What's going on?
I just have one quick question for you.
Are we ever gonna win another fucking match?
Um...
Well, I hear the concern in your voice and its volume.
And it's funny 'cause we were just brainstorming in here, coming up with some real strong solves.
You know what we're gonna do? Pretend this club was a ship.
We're gonna take that ship, we're gonna turn around.
Go against the tide, point that baby right at the North Star and follow it all the way home.
That's north, Ted.
 This way is. Okay.
 I'm pretty sure it's that way.
 That's what I meant. That way.
 No, it's right fucking that way.
 You know, I'm discombobulated.
 No! You're all wrong! It's that way!
Shoot.
I think.
Hmm.
 Mmm.
 Can I take this for you?
You can. Thank you very much.
Sorry, do you think you can take this as well?
Rebecca.
John Wingsnight. What a lovely surprise.
- Hello.
 Oh, uh, this is Jessica Darling.
Jessica, darling, Rebecca Welton.
- It's so lovely to meet you.
 Oh, hi. Likewise. Hello, there.
Uh, we actually went out on a few dates.
And then Rebecca dumped me out of nowhere. In this exact coffee shop.
Not that I come here all the time, hoping to run into you.
- 'Cause I don't.
 Okay.
Well, may I say, Rebecca, thank you.
We're engaged.
Ring-a-ding-ding. Wedding calling.
Engaged. Congratulations. That's-- Wow.
How-- did it happen?
Oh, we matched on the apps, uh, six months ago.
Not Bantr. Couldn't use that. It felt a bit weird since, uh-- - Yeah.
 And in a sea of anythings, I went fishing and caught myself a soul mate.
Oh.
Took her to see Hamilton on our first date.
- Amazing.
 And then defended my honor.
Oh, God. Yeah. Get this. It's intermission.
We're standing in line to buy the CD of the soundtrack, 'cause I refuse to stream music. And guess who's standing in front of us.
- Sir Anthony Hopkins.
 Can you imagine?
- Nope.
 Jessica politely taps him on the shoulder and asks if he'll film a little video for Jessica's father as Hannibal Lecter, you know.
- And he said no.
 Yeah.
So I grabbed that rapscallion by the collar, and I said, "Hey, we didn't ask you to be famous." And took a quick ussie of the three of us and emailed it to her-- her dad's nurse.
Made his day.
My shite in nining armor.
What? I just-- What did you say?
You jumbled your words there a bit.
What did you-- You just said, "shite in nining armor"?
Yeah. I-- I meant to say "knight in shining armor." I just-- One of me brain farts.
Quite rare for her. She's actually very smart.
Went to Oxford for a bit.
Wait, n-no, you said, "shite in nining armor." You actually said those specific words.
I did.
Anyway, uh, we should go. Lovely to see you, Rebecca.
You okay? Have you eaten?
I completely understand where Barbara's coming from, but as I was explaining to you, I'm worried that by adding more clients, that could mean less attention paid to the wonderful people we already represent.
And then I-- I reminded Keeley, as you've said so many times, Jack, that, um, if it does get to the point where we feel we're spreading ourselves thinly, then we'll hire more people.
It's called "growth." - Okay. Uh, let me weigh in here.
 Oh, please.
- I agree with Keeley.
 Well, that's great.
Being a small boutique firm is exactly what sets you apart.
You want a restaurant to look successful, you take out half the tables and you have a line out the door.
I say let's go for it.
 Hmm.
 No, that's wonderful. Yeah.
And instead of salaries, we can give away the tables we threw out.
 Don't worry, Barbara. It'll be great.
 Oh, yeah. Yes. Definitely.
You ever think sunshine gets jealous of her?
 Knock, knock.
 Hi, babe.
Now that your little, uh, cool girls meeting's done, just wanted to share the exciting news that I've started an app.
Oh.
It's like Bantr, but it's better and cooler and actually cares about helping people have sex with celebrities.
What? Shandy.
It's called "Star Fuckr." And, yeah, we are looking for investors.
I take it she's still angry about the whole Bantr thing?
Oh, yes. Mmm.
Shandy does not have a good relationship with rejection, or her ex, or with the workplace, or most nouns, really.
"You are so passionate, but I have to let you go.
I'm sorry, but I know someone as brilliant as you will land on their feet." What did I do?
No, no, no, no. Keeley, sor-- sorry.
That's what you say when you fire Shandy.
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
It's called a compliment sandwich.
You-- You give someone bad news, but to soften the blow, you slap it between two delicious slices of compliments.
Oh. But I can't fire Shandy.
She'll hate me.
And she really thinks she's killing it.
Oh, I am sure she does.
The worst people often think they're the best.
My dad calls it "talent dysmorphia." That's good.
You wanna get some lunch? My-- My meeting just got pushed.
Abso-fucking-lutely!
Yeah, my stomach started grumbling when you said "compliment sandwich."  Aw, shit. Come and look at this.
 Ooh.
Man, how the fuck does Nate bag a baddie like Anastasia?
Oh, maybe she made a bet.
 Oh. In, like, She's All That.
 Yeah.
Yes! But Nate does not have glasses and a ponytail hiding his beauty.
Nah, fuck no.
His transformation's gonna be on the inside.
 Yeah.
 You know, She's All That is just the film version of the musical My Fair Lady.
Which is based on the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion.
I love pigs. They are cute but also have the same intelligence as a human toddler.
Yeah, but Anastasia's just really fit, innit?
 Oh, yeah. She's very pretty.
 She's the coldest, bro.
Hey, Zava. What do you think of Anastasia?
I don't.
My wife, Christina, is the only woman I see with clarity.
Every other woman is a smudge.
Wow.
My wife is sexy, but in a girl-next-door kind of way.
Glasses, ponytail, she paints.
Like the girl in She's All That.
 Like what?
 It's a movie.
Oh, I don't care about, uh, moving pictures.
My favorite thing to watch is my wife.
Wow.
If we stay with our 4-5-1, we're fucked.
If we move to 4-4-2, we're fucked. But if we try a 5-3-2...
 We're gonna win?
 We're fucked.
 Shoot. Hmm.
 Man City.
I can't believe our white whale has the same name as the strip club where I danced in college.
Um...
What's going on, Trent? You got an idea for us?
Um, no, I can't. I'm, uh-- I'm only here to observe.
 I-- I couldn't, um, interfere.
 I get it.
You know, you're kinda like one of them sadistic nature documentarians that won't put down their camera even though they see a poor, defenseless, adorable, little, injured monkey about to get attacked by a pack of hyenas.
All right. Okay.
Have you ever considered an old-school long-ball game?
 Oh, what, like route one?
 What's that?
A kick-and-rush tactic that can be a viable option for an overmatched team against a superior opponent.
Okay, well, great. Let's do that then.
Nah, their center backs are too athletic.
 They'd murder us.
 Yeah, you're fucked.
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
 Uh...
 Everything okay, Ted?
Uh, Henry got bullied at school this morning.
If we leave right now and take the connecting flight through Paris, we can be in Kansas by noon, and that punk's house will be in ashes by 12:30!
No, no. Best thing you can do with bullies is ignore them.
Then you sneak into their house at 4:00 a. m., which, statistically speaking, is the hour people are least prepared to defend themselves.
Correct.
And once you're standing over them, as they sleep in their bed, you start to beat them.
With a thick, heavy rope soaked in red paint.
Pummeling them over and over until they wake, confusing the paint for their own blood.
When they beg you to stop, you laugh as loud as you can, for as long as you can.
And then you start to beat them again.
Mmm. Yeah.
You know, I may just hold off on anything like that until I connect with Michelle and just get the details, see what actually happened.
Yeah, all right. Yeah, fair enough.
 But thank you.
 Pleasure.
Hmm.
Rebecca, do you have a moment?
Of course.
May I have a seat?
Leslie, this formality is really freaking me out. Just sit.
The thing is, the club is going in the wrong direction, and I fear that it has little to do with the quality of our players.
Therefore, if we don't do well against City, we may have to consider-- think about thinking about possibly, maybe focusing on theoretically, as it were, changing the manager of our club.
You want to fire Ted?
At what point during any of that did it seem like something I wanted to do?
Leslie, this is too bleak for me at the moment.
Therefore, I am granting myself permission to change the subject.
Do you believe in psychics?
Oh. Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I mean you're so, I don't know whimsical.
Thank you. My Aunt Devorah has a touch of the shine, a little bit of the inner eye.
And she predicted that Julie and I would have five children, all boys.
And look at us now.
Just a house full of soaking wet toilet seats.
Uh, why do you ask?
Oh, a few weeks ago, I sort of went and saw a psychic.
Not sort of. I-- I completely saw one.
Wha-- Wow! What did she say about the season?
 I didn't ask.
 Ah.
She was a bit of a quack. But she did say a couple of things would happen, and now they've happened.
Mmm.
That's odd, isn't it?
The universe is full of things we can't explain, Rebecca.
Fingernails. What's that about?
And psychics, even if some of them are charlatans, they can help us see something in ourselves that we can't quite see ourselves.
Thank you, Leslie.
Mmm. Hmm.
Oh, hello, Ms. Kakes.
 From Rupert?
 My friend Anastasia.
She wants you to call her.
She was surprised you didn't ask for her number at Bones & Honey.
Well, I didn't want to appear too forward.
Okay.
Oh, um, hello. Uh, I'm glad that I've caught you.
It's, uh, Nathan Shelley.
Uh, I really enjoyed meeting you the other night, and I was hoping that we could meet for another drink.
Yeah, sorry, Mum. I'm just, uh, practicing for the-- Yeah. How was I?
"I think we should meet for another drink" is more direct.
Yeah. Okay, yeah. Thank you.
All right, love you. Bye-bye. Bye.
Okay.
Should go for another drink. Should.
 Hey, Coach.
 Hello, Rebecca.
 Ted.
 No, I know, I know, I know.
You are still feeling bad about yelling at me the other day, right?
I can be a little bit psychic.
It's okay.
No, yes, I-- I shouldn't have bullied you.
 Nice speaking with you, boss.
 You too, Ted.
Afternoon.
Hi.
Ms. Jones.
 Hope you enjoyed your lunch with Jack.
 Mmm.
Um, just a quick question.
Did you tell Shandy to call Emma Jayye at 4:00 in the morning, whilst drunk on "espresso martinis," to pitch her an idea for "condoms for balls"?
 What?
 Emma Jayye designs sunglasses.
Yeah, no, of course I didn't do that. Why?
Oh, because she just fired us.
Because of Shandy.
Because of your friend.
Shandy.
 Yeah?
 Can I speak with you, please?
 Can you give me 30 minutes?
 No, now.
 Please can I watch?
 Barbara.
Hi. I can give you five minutes, then I have to go downstairs and meet with a potential assistant.
She's scared of elevators. It's cute, right?
Can you come have a seat, please?
Yeah.
Shandy.
Am I getting a raise?
You are so brilliant.
But...
My bold determination? What the fuck?
All right! Listen up, sheep.
I was just let go because some people can't handle working with an innovator.
So, I'm starting my own PR firm to take this place down.
Who's coming with me?
I'll pay you double what you're making here.
Who's coming with me?
All right.
Three months holiday every year, company car, massage table in the office with a licensed masseuse.
Who's coming with me?
I'll go with you.
 Not you, Dan.
 Right.
Barbara. I know you're with me.
I couldn't be less with you.
That's because you're a coward, and I fucking hate you.
I hate all of you!
Oh, Keeley, please let me stay.
I just love it here so much. We're a family.
 I love you.
 You're gonna be fine, Shandy. I pro-- No, I'm not!
Oh, you bunch of fascist fucks!
I fucking-- You fucking ten-percenters.
Yeah, that's what you are.
You know what? Fuck you all.
That's ours.
Well, fuck off then.
Dan, let's go.
Actually, I'm staying.
Suck my dick.
All right.
Mmm.
Well, I'm not gonna say it.
No, but you're gonna think it.
Yes, often. And forever.
Hello, there. I'm Rebecca Welton. I have an appointment with Dr. Wagner.
Fill this out, and he'll be right with you.
 Ah, thank you so much. Thank you.
 Take a seat.
 Rebecca. What a nice surprise.
 Ah.
 You don't have to fill out all that junk.
 Oh.
 Come on back, my dear.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Take a seat.
 Yep. Thank you.
 Make yourself at home.
So, how are you holding up?
Given Richmond's current slump?
You poor thing. So stressful, it must be.
Well, it's been a bit tough, I'll admit.
But, um, we're just in a bit of a bad stretch.
Well, it will all work out. I know it.
As long as you have Zava, you'll be just fine.
 He's amazing, isn't he?
 He is. Yes.
Yes, we're, uh-- we're lucky to have him.
So tell me, what brings you in today?
Right. So, um, you know, I'm-- I'm aware that what I'm about to ask, given my age, uh, is a bit far-fetched.
But I was just wondering if...
If you're able to have children?
Yes. That.
It's not far-fetched at all.
I treat women your age, and older, all of the time.
 You do?
 Absolutely.
Now, that said, I can't guarantee-- Oh, no, of course. I know.
But we can run some tests and see what's possible. Sound good?
Great. Yep. Thank you.
Well, uh, sit tight, relax.
I'll have our tech, uh, take some blood and do some imaging.
 Wonderful to see you.
 Likewise.
Go Richmond!
Right, listen up.
When you're leaving, get yourself a shower. Get some rest.
More importantly, no video games before bedtime.
Unless it's Animal Crossing. That shit's fucking soothing.
 Yeah. Mm-hmm.
 Well done, guys.
You know, I think we're really starting to turn our fortunes around.
 Well, actually, Sam--  Jan Maas, no need.
Sam, we're playing like shit, and we all know it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Hey. Enough of that negativity.
Yeah, City are great. They just are.
But who the fuck cares? 'Cause so are we.
So stop acting like a bunch of little bunny rabbits.
Let's fucking do this, yeah?
Jamie is so right.
It's as if he were Zava.
Get off me, man.
You see, I am no prophet.
Prophets believe in something.
I do not just believe.
I know in my heart, in my bones, in my well-defined delts, traps and glutes that there is no opponent this team cannot conquer.
I literally just said that.
You will not win because of me.
You will win because you work together.
Because together...
you can achieve anything.
Manchester City is going down!
Hey. There you are.
<i>Hey, Ted. I'm sorry we kept missing each other.</i> That's okay. I get it, you know?
How's the little guy doing?
<i>He's okay. He's actually at the park right now.</i> He is? Oh, that's great.
<i>Yeah. Jake thought it'd be a good idea to get outside, get some fresh air.</i> Yeah. No, that's, uh-- that's-- that's smart. Yeah.
Um, what about you? How are you doing?
<i>Oh, I've definitely been better.</i> I hear you.
I've been pulling my hair out all day over this.
You know, I actually told Beard and Roy about what happened.
Those fellas were ready to hop on a flight to Kansas and go full Wicked Witch of the West on the kid that bullied him.
<i>No, Ted, um, Henry wasn't bullied. He was the bully.</i> What?
<i>AFC Richmond versus Manchester City.</i> <i>Normally, the Greyhound faithful mark the loss on the calendar</i> <i>before the match is even played.</i> <i>But tonight, with Zava, hope is in the air</i> <i>that Richmond will finally prevail in this decidedly one-sided rivalry.</i> It's, uh, quitting time.
I'll see you tomorrow, Dan.
No.
I quit.
No, no. I'm joking.
U-Unless you want me to quit?
 No, I'd love to see you tomorrow, Dan.
 Okay.
 Night.
 All right. Thank you.
 Good night, Ms. Jones.
 Oh, night, Barbara.
 Barbara?
 Oh.
Ooh!
Do you wanna go see the Richmond match tonight? Either of you?
Will it be as violent as last time?
 Probably not.
 Then no.
I'll tag along.
Uh, can I borrow your office to make some calls?
Oh, yes, of course. Yes.
Just don't look in my desk drawer.
Don't.
I'm definitely gonna look in those drawers.
Mmm-hmm.
Zava! Zava!
Zava! Zava! Zava! Zava!
Peel 'em.
Slice 'em.
 Cut 'em.
 Yeah.
 Mash 'em.
 I'm not playing.
 Cheer until your voice bleeds.
 Okay.
Eat 'em.
 Outclass 'em, Sam.
 Thank you, Coach.
Oi. Where's Zava?
Hey, Coach. Check it out.
115 straight days, no pee drops on the khakis. New record.
Proud of you.
You connect with Henry yet?
No, keep missing each other.
Why can't the world just have one big time zone, you know?
 The sun.
 Right, the gosh-dang sun. Oy, oy, oy.
Henry's a good kid, 'cause you're his dad.
Mm-hmm.
And whatever's going on with him, he's gonna be just fine.
Thank you, Coach. I needed to hear that.
No, you needed to hear it.
 That's what I said.
 You did?
We got a fucking problem.
Oh. Is that my...
Two questions. Um, are you ready to leave for the match?
And do you smell that awful stench?
Yes and yes.
Oh, my God. What was that?
That is fucking weird.
Oh! Wow!
What the fuck?
Where did that come from?
Oh, my God.
"The lion has left. Enjoy the lamb, bitch. XOXO, Shandy." Jesus.
It's a gentle reminder to cancel her security badge.
Fuck me.
Oh, my God! That is so sour.
After you.
Oh.
Ooh.
Hello, Jade. Um, Shelley.
Uh, reservation for two. Thank you.
And you, miss? How can I help you?
 Oh--  Oh, no, she, uh-- We, uh-- This is Anastasia.
Uh, she is a very famous model, uh, and we are on a date.
Togeth-- Together. Two. For two.
Hello.
Um, you have very cute head.
Thank you. I got it from my father.
 Right this way.
 Oh, no. Sorry, Jade, dear.
Uh, we would like the, uh, window table, please.
 I'll have to go ask Derek.
 I already checked with Derek.
Oh, Nathan Jelly! The wonder kid!
Yeah. Touch it.
 Hey!
 Uh-huh.
And, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slap me round the face. Am I dreaming?
The one and only Anastasia in my restaurant.
I'm a huge fan of your face and body.
Best table in the house for you two. If you'd like to come this way?
Oh. Yeah.
There you go.
 There you go.
 Thank you, Derek.
 Enjoy.
 Thank you.
Hmm.
It's not very nice in here.
Oh. No, but-- Just wait till you try the food, 'cause the baklava is divine.
Hmm.
I have some bad news.
Let's go, lads. Let's go! Come on!
And Richmond are ready to start the game with Colin Hughes in place of Zava.
Hughes for Zava. Any thoughts, Chris?
Yes. That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
<i>And we're off. But where is Zava?</i> Hey. Any news?
Nobody knows where he is.
That fucking prick's not answering his phone.
Neither is his agent, his manager, his publicist, his trainer, his acupuncturist, his acupressurist, his fecalist, his avocado whisperer, not even his barber.
Hmm. Maybe he's dead.
Fucking better be.
<i>Richmond have played without Zava for ten minutes,</i> <i>and we're all left wondering why.</i> Goodbye, my sweet little stinky friend.
If Shandy asks to borrow an animal again, please say no.
Oh, sorry, Keeley.
She promised to get a date with a celebrity.
I've always wanted to come out of a restaurant and say, "No pictures, please." Edward, gotta love someone for what they are, not who they are.
Mmm.
 And here is a giant bag of shit.
 Oh.
Yeah. That's finally starting to smell better, right?
Better? Uh, sure.
Now it smells like someone took a dump directly into a pumpkin spice latte.
Oi. I could use a drink actually. You don't have anything, do you?
Oh, shit. No, sorry.
Wait.
Shandy's work vodka finally comes in handy.
Nice. Where'd she hide that?
On her desk.
 Yeah.
 You probably want a mixer and ice.
Candied oranges?
Keeley, you're adorable.
But I went to the most prestigious boarding school in Denmark.
We chugged warm vodka for breakfast.
Wow. It takes a lot to surprise me, and yet you just did.
<i>Skål.</i> Cheers.
I cannot post this.
The little dips look like piles of vomit.
I cannot post vomit. People will see this, and they will want to vomit.
Okay. Um, well, the good news is, it tastes a lot better than it looks.
And this pita is, um, freshly made at the bakery down the road.
Feed it to me.
Okay. Mm-hmm.
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
 Yeah? Yeah?
 Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
 Nate?
 Yeah?
Can we please leave? I mean, the food is yummy, but it's just so dumpy and sad.
Okay, look, I know it might not exactly be cool, but this place is important to me.
This is where my family celebrated our birthdays, anniversaries.
It's where we came after I got promoted as assistant coach at Richmond.
Every important event in our lives has been spent here.
And, to me, that makes this place even better than cool.
Hmm.
Oh, what am I thinking? We should get the saganaki!
Oh, I'm going to make a call.
My friend has the flu. And I have to check on her.
No, that's-- No, that's very nice. That's kind.
Do you need all that stuff to go make a call?
All right.
Sorry, mate.
Still got to charge you for the booze.
<i>And the final score is 4-0</i> <i>as the Richmond Ahabs are still unable to catch their great blue whale.</i> <i>And without Zava, we're left wondering</i> if this team even belongs in the Premier League.
Well, without Zava, this team doesn't belong in my church league, Arlo.
It's actually a competitive league  with some very talented clergy.
 Boo!
You're all a bunch of fucking wankers!
McAdoo, you are shit!
Without Zava, you're shit! Even with Zava, you're shit!
Hello, Doctor.
Ah, yes. Yes, big loss today.
Mmm. I did. I-- I just, uh, saw-- saw the announcement.
Yes, extraordinary talent.
Sorry, Doctor. I'm-- I'm just in a little bit of a rush.
That would be great. Thank-- Thank you.
Ah. Okay.
Right. Yes. That's-- That's what I thought.
Oh, it's-- it's definitely to be-- Bet-- Better to be sure.
Yeah, well, thanks again.
Yes. Yes, it was nice to see you again too.
Thank you.
What? You actually dated a birthday clown?
For three wacky weeks.
Did you ever have sex with the clown? Like, with the nose and everything?
Of course I did.
It was in his car, actually.
All crammed in there with, like, 30 of his clown friends.
God. Hearing about all your bozo exes, making me feel much better about my last relationship.
 Oh, the footballer, right?
 Yeah.
Yeah. Jamie what's-his-name?
No. Well, yeah-- No-- Um...
The bad breakup?
No. It was fun. Five stars. Would break again.
Hmm.
Actually, it was, uh-- it was...
No, I'm not gonna go there. I'm not gonna talk about it.
Because it still hurts.
And I'm tired of feeling like that. I used to be a happy person.
 You seem happy to me.
 It's funny.
I mean, not like fucking a clown funny.
We spent all evening picking up, like, 50 kilos of lamb ka-poops.
It's the most fun I've had in months.
Oh, I have way more fun than this, like, all the time.
Oh, fuck off.
Oi.
Thank you for all of it.
You're welcome.
Shit. I'm so sorry. I should not have done that.
No, you absolutely should have.
Baklava for two.
Oh, yeah, um...
My date had to...
Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to eat all that on my own.
Unless you-- you'd care to join me. No. No.
Sure.
After all, our baklava is divine.
Yeah, I don't-- Um...
For some reason, whenever I'm trying to impress someone, I end up sounding like my gran.
 Your gran?
 Mm-hmm.
Um, okay, well...
Take a seat.
The only modicum of comfort is knowing that in all the innumerable parallel universes, there is not one where we win that game.
I know what Madchester is.
Uh, hey, fellas. It's, uh, Henry. Do you mind if I...
Do your thing.
Thanks.
Hey, big guy.
<i>Hi. Sorry about the match.</i> Oh, don't worry about that. It happens. It's good to see you, man.
Hey, um, look, I've been really wanting to talk to you about what happened at school the other day, you know?
<i>Dad, I messed up.</i> <i>And if-- if I'd just followed your advice, then none of this would've happened.</i>  What advice?
"If you're angry, count to ten.
<i>If that don't work, do it again."</i> Yeah.
Well, that's something my dad used to say.
Then Nana would tell him that numbers were infinite just so she could deal with his snoring.
Uh, is Doug all right?
<i>I let him know that I was sorry</i> <i>by doing an apology rap in front of the whole class.</i> Huh.
Well, you know, a hip-hop song's a great way to get across a message.
You know? Just look at the hip-hop song "The Message." Hey, guys. Good effort today.
Mr. Higgins, is it true about Zava?
I'm afraid so.
Maybe some tissues for Dani.
Hey, hey, guys. Zava just posted a video.
<i>Hello. How are you? I'm just-- I have to share something with you, my friends.</i> <i>You are not my followers. You are my believers.</i> <i>And so it-- I have to tell you.</i> <i>Zava has played his last match.</i> <i>I will now dedicate all of my time and all of my energy</i> <i>to my family and my avocado farm.</i> <i>If you put your energy into the things you truly love,</i> <i>the universe puts its thing back into you. You're welcome.</i> Um, hey, buddy.
I gotta go talk to the team here real quick.
But then I'm gonna grab my stuff and scurry home.
And how about we hop online, play a little Roblox? How does that sound?
<i>You're on. Love you, Dad.</i> I love you too, buddy. I'm proud of you.
He's okay. He's okay.
He's okay. He's okay.
Hmm.
Gentlemen, hey.
That was a tough one tonight. Okay?
Man City has still got our number. That-- That's all right.
We're gonna get another crack at 'em later in the season. Uh-huh.
Coach, no practice tomorrow, yeah?
 That's right.
 Okay. Well, I'll see y'all on Monday.
Hey, hey. Hey, Coach.
What about Zava?
Um...
He quit the team.
I mean, technically he retired from the whole sport, which makes it feel a little less personal, yeah?
You know, like if, uh, your girlfriend runs off with some dude and it turns out they were soul mates.
Oh. Yeah.
Gina fucking Gershon.
Right.
Uh, but look, look, look, look. I hear you, okay? Zava is gone.
And you know what? I think it's a good thing.
 What? How?
 Well, I do. Okay, look.
Do I wanna win? Heck yeah.
But I also wanna do it with folks that wanna be here.
It's not like we could handcuff him to his locker and make him love us.
We could have tried.
Hey, guys. Guys, look. We got a good thing going here.
 All right?
 Mm-hmm.
We didn't need Zava. Yeah?
Yeah.
All we need to win are the fellas in this room right now.
And all you fellas need to do is believe it.
 Whoa!
 It's a sign.
That's it. We're doomed.
We're done. We're done. We're finished. We're finished.
Now-- Now, hold on.
Hey, knock it off, okay? We're not doomed. No one is doomed.
But, Bumbercatch, yes, you're right. It is a sign. I agree. Yeah.
In fact this, it's just a sign.
All right, guys, listen to me.
Belief doesn't just happen 'cause you hang something up on a wall.
All right? It comes from in here.
You know? And up here. Down here.
Only problem is, we all got so much junk floating through us, a lot of time we end up getting in our own way.
You know, crap like envy or fear, shame.
I don't wanna mess around with that shit anymore.
You know what I mean? Do you?
 No.
 No, Coach.
 No.
 No.
 Do you?
 No.
No, me neither. Hell no.
Well, you know what I wanna mess around with?
<i>The belief that I matter, you know? Regardless of what I do or don't achieve.</i> <i>Or the belief that we all deserve to be loved,</i> whether we've been hurt or maybe we've hurt somebody else.
<i>Or what about the belief of hope? Yeah? That's what I wanna mess with.</i> Believing that things can get better.
That I can get better. That we will get better.
Oh, man. To believe in yourself. To believe in one another.
Man, that's-- that's fundamental to being alive.
And look. Yo, hey. If you can do that, if each of you can truly do that...
can't nobody rip that apart.
 See y'all Monday?
 Yes, Coach.
Thank you.
 Tomorrow at 4:00 a. m.?
 Damn fucking right.
 
@@@@@@
Man, we can't even get a goal for an exhibition match.
Friendly.
Ain't nothing friendly about what happened out here.
They call exhibition matches friendlies.
Man, this sport drives me nuts.
Rebecca. My apologies.
Now, you've come all the way to Amsterdam, and we at Ajax have been such rude hosts.
Marjolein, you've been more than gracious. Especially given the circumstances.
There we are.
Till next time.
Thank you.
Truly was an honor to play here at the Johan Croyff Arena.
No. The honor is ours completely. But it is pronounced Johan Cruijff.
Still.
God, this song's depressing.
Would you agree that this has been an extremely demoralizing result?
But, luckily our spirits were already broken.
Yeah. And so, Roy Kent, don't you think Richmond's objectively poor performance is due to the fact that you're nothing without Zava?
Who cares? It's a fucking friendly. A friendly is a pretend match.
This is a pretend conversation.
You're a pretend person with a pretend job.
And I'm having a really hard time pretending to give a shit.
Wow.
Right.
Jan...
 Hi. Thanks.
 Hi. Love the pink.
Okay, a night out in Amsterdam it is.
Let's make the best of it. What's the plan?
I'm spoken for, I'm afraid.
It's my first time in Amsterdam, and I have a date with someone special in the red-light district.
Nah.
 Just you and me then, kid.
 I'd love to...
 That's a quick cancellation.
 How'd you know I was gonna cancel?
Because there's a certain note in your vocal range that you only ever hit when you're being preemptively apologetic.
 Come on. Out with it.
 All right.
Apparently, tonight is the best aurora borealis ever.
Like, it's the aurora "boreal-iest." In Norway.
And Jack and her plane are waiting for me at the airport right now.
Subtle.
And amazing.
Go.
 I promise I'll make it up to you.
 Yes, you will.
Great job, Jan.
And, Roy, thank you again for doing this.
Yeah. Anytime.
 I love you.
 I love you.
 Where's she going?
 Somewhere that believes they deserve her.
Hey, there he is.
 Someone's in a mood.
 Yeah.
 Wait.
 Actually...
What do you think?
Think only you can get these guys out of their pineapple percussions.
Doldrums. Nice.
Yeah, I'm gonna say something.
Hey, fellas.
I'm about to say three words no coach ever says unless he dang well means it.
 "You're all shit."  No.
 "Knowledge is power"?
 True, but no.
 "Live, laugh, love."  No.
Correct answer is: "No curfew tonight."  What?
 That's right.
I don't wanna see your pretty faces until we get back on this bus at what time, Coach?
10:00 a. m., baby!
You heard the man. 10:00 a. m.
All right, let's be careful out there. <i>Hill Street Blues</i>.
Smart move, Coach.
Yeah. Well, you know, they need it.
Not as bad as you do.
No curfew in Amsterdam, boys!
Should we all take naps so we can stay up later?
No. We push through, and we all meet in the lobby five o'clock sharp.
Yeah!
Tonight is gonna be mad, you know!
Not for you, Tartt!
Let's go.
You serious?
You're not on fucking holiday from training.
What about my stuff?
Right.
Throw this away, please.
Let's go!
Great. Sick. You have fun.
Gonna see the sights. Training. Amsterdam.
 Don't actually throw that away, yeah?
 Okay.
Hey. Wait up, Coach!
Getting off the coach, Coach.
Run!
This is gonna be so good.
Hey. How about you roll with me tonight?
That'd be wonderful. Thank you.
Yeah. Great. Our first stop: the red-light district.
Did you know Amsterdam's origins date back to the 13th century?
That's mad, innit?
Coach, this way.
This is the world-famous Skinny Bridge!
Yeah?
As seen in major motion picture, James Bond's <i>Diamonds Are Forever.</i> Stop with all the fucking sightseeing shit, you twat.
Right. Next stop, Amsterdam's thinnest house.
It's gonna blow your mind, lad. Come on. Get moving, lad.
Hello.
<i>Stinky, what's wrong?</i>  Nothing. Why? <i>- Bullshit!</i> <i>I felt warm in my belly, so there must be a problem. Out with it.</i> Sass, you know, you're actually wrong this time.
<i>I am never wrong.</i> Jesus.
<i>What are all those bells?</i> <i>Are you in a casino?</i> No. I'm actually just out having a stroll in Amsterdam on my own.
Completely unburdened. I haven't even got my bag with me.
<i>Oh, right. Amsterdam. I forgot. Jealous.</i> <i>Well, eat a space cake for me and call me when you freak out.</i>  I love you. <i>- Buh-buh-bye.</i>  Yeah.
 Yes?
I saw you walking just there, and I thought, "I have to say something to this beautiful woman." Right. What exactly were you...
Oh, my God. Oh, my! Go...
Shit.
Oh, my God!
Are you hurt?
No. I'm okay.
 It's just very cold.
 Come on.
Sorry, did you see where my phone went?
Who cares? You're alive. Come on.
Yeah. Yes. Okay. It's my phone, so...
Fair enough.
Come. You need to get warm.
What is it that you wanted to tell me?
You're walking on the bike lane.
I mean, how the fuck am I supposed to know that?
Stupid fucking place.
Come on.
Like, remember when Jordan wouldn't wear Reebok in the '92 Olympics?
Of course.
'74 World Cup, Cruyff refuses to wear Adidas, they gotta make him a special two-striped shirt. He was a badass.
But he was also a paragon of the '60s, so he was bigger than Jordan, really.
He was like Jordan and John Lennon combined.
That's cool.
 You pick a place to eat yet?
 Oh, shoot. No, I forgot.
On it.
Let's see.
Hey! This could be good. Yankee Doodle Burger Barn.
"An authentic American dining experience with American-sized portions." You know, I could definitely go for a little taste of home.
 How's that sound, Coach?
 What's it rated?
2.7.
Out of five.
Think we can beat that.
All right.
I don't know what's going on with me, Coach.
It's like I'm feeling stuck or something, you know?
I need to do something to help me get me out of my head.
Like get punched in the face or drink a couple of bottles of red wine and yell at my mom.
You know, just... I wanna try something new.
Help me get inspired.
I've been waiting for you to say those words for a very long time.
We should have took a train to Paris a long time ago.
Would any of you gentlemen care for some drinks?
Leffe Blond.
 I'll have a beer and a shot of te...
 No!
We're about to head out, but thank you.
No worries.
Okay. Yeah. That's everyone.
So, what's the plan for the night then, Captain?
I'm taking all your suggestions.
For me, the best option for a night in Amsterdam is a train to Paris.
I told you... I'm gonna say it again. I am not kidding.
You know, my father actually suggested we take a boat tour through the canal.
 Yeah. Great way to see the city.
 We're near The Hague.
We can go to the International Court of Justice.
Poke around. Ask some questions.
I would like to see a tulip.
 You mean tulip fields?
 No. Just one tulip.
An entire field will be incredibly overwhelming.
Wait. Y'all are joking, right? We gotta go to a live sex show.
Very cultural, Thierry.
Yo, Trent! What should we do?
Well, the city has a wonderful museum culture.
In fact, tonight is what's known as <i>Museumnacht</i>, where they stay open till quite late.
I didn't come to Amsterdam to learn things.
Yeah.
 Sorry, Trent.
 Great shot though.
I don't know. The city does seem lovely, but maybe it would just be easier if all of us stayed in and enjoyed a nice team movie night.
Sam, come on.
Hey, boys. Have fun tonight.
Higgins. Where you going?
Tonight's the night young William here becomes a man.
Cheers.
Nah.
Jan Maas, we're on your home turf. What you got for us?
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Good point. Let's go.
Okay, tourists, thank you for getting all those terrible ideas out of the way.
Now listen, my cousin, Martin Garrix, is deejaying  at a private all-night party.
 I guess it's his cousin.
We're talking drinking, dancing and women into the morning, which is when they'll be serving a hearty breakfast.
Hey, guys, I'm sorry. Sorry. I think I need to bow out.
Yeah. I ate some pickled herring earlier, and now my stomach's bothering me.
 You're gonna miss the live sex show, bro.
 You mean the party.
I cannot wait to hear all the dirty details.
Good luck, gents.
 See you later.
 All right.
All right, broski.
Hydrate!
Right. So it seems like this private party is the obvious answer?
 Yep.
 Okay, great.
We just gotta take the bus to Groningen, which is only a two-hour drive.
Two hours?
 It breezes over.
 Two.
You will love it.
Hey, amigos. Why don't we just split up?
The tulips with me!
No! Overruled.
We pick one place, and we go as a team.
Excuse me. I think we're gonna order them drinks now.
And can you bring me a giant stack of napkins? Thanks.
Voting time.
 Dude, a sex show is funny.
 We're not going to a sex show.
I really want the tulip experience that everyone talks about.
Actually surprisingly good water pressure for a boat.
Hello?
Oh, shit.
Hello?
Hello?
Fuck me.
Right down there's the bench from <i>Fault in Our Stars</i>!
The movie!
Tourist!
So, red-light district.
 That's right.
 Cool. Okay. Awesome.
 Is everything all right at home or...
 Here we are.
His name was Chet Baker.
American, gifted trumpeter, unique singer and a heroin addict.
He was tortured by demons, but they didn't stop him from making beautiful music.
He's what got me into jazz in the first place, you know.
You hear his story and you think, "There's nothing more punk rock than that." Then, on the 13th of May, 1988, he passed away on this very spot.
Wow. How was it he died?
He fell from that window up there.
But was it an accident? Did he jump, or was he pushed?
And we're gonna solve that mystery tonight.
No. We're just here to pay our respects to a legend.
What led to his death? We don't know, Will.
 We only know this: drugs are bad.
 Yes.
 No, they are.
 Yeah.
My man, Kenneth the bus driver, hooked me up a couple of weeks ago.
Wait, so you travel with it?
I thought they had plenty of that stuff here.
Well, I just don't like my medicine to be taxed.
I don't know, Coach.
You know, I've always been more of a beer man or Sour Patch Kids.
Sour Patch Kids don't form literal new pathways in your brain.
Picture a sheet of fresh, white snow covering all the footsteps of all the paths that you've trod before, forcing you... Nay, encouraging you... to begin anew.
And how's it taste?
Disgusting, so most people put it in peanut butter and jelly or yogurt.
Uh-huh. And which one we doing?
Neither. We're doing tea.
Oh, come on, man. Are you kidding me?
That's like hiding poop inside a smoothie of barf.
I don't say this often enough because I generally think it's implied, but trust me.
This is how you change your mind.
I can't do it, Coach. I'm sorry.
Oh, boy.
Did you have any?
 Where we at?
 We have nine votes for sex show.
Nine votes for private party.
And one vote for tulip.
That leaves us with two. Sex show versus private party.
And I think someone picked tulip, yes? But who?
Dani, you wrote it in Spanish.
Someone wrote it in Spanish, yes.
Look, it doesn't matter what we choose. This has to be unanimous. Discuss.
Okay, the idea of seeing a sex show is one that makes me more uncomfortable than aroused.
Right? Right.
Which is why I'm still in favor of, you know, a nice, simple movie night.
But as I said earlier, Jan's admittedly inconvenient plan is an excellent second option.
Yeah? Yes? Okay. Great. All right. Let's go.
Wh... No. Guys. Stick with me.
We're two hours away from that party.
But we're only ten minutes away from watching some sex. Come on.
Things flying about...
Can you please tell my friend that he is being a boring tourist?
 What is your name?
 Everybody calls me Van Damme.
Okay, Van Damme, would you prefer to pay to watch two tired people have sex or rather go to a party where perhaps you could get some yourself?
They're tired?
Exhausted.
We can finally start our night in Amsterdam!
In Groningen, yes!
No, wait. We need to eat first, right?
Yes. Definitely. Okay. What do you want to eat?
 Ramen.
 Shawarma!
No way. We haven't eaten...
Some brownies with marijuana. Or maybe some Mexican?
 Hello?
 It's me. Is it okay to come in?
Yeah, of course. It's your house... boat.
Hi.
You really didn't need to leave.
No, but taking a shower on a stranger's boat is uncomfortable enough.
And you shouldn't be worried that he's watching you through some peephole.
 Peephole?
 Yeah.
Someone's dated themselves.
Had you down as more of a webcam kind of guy... Anyway, thank you, nonetheless.
You're bleeding.
 I'm what?
 You're bleeding.
What?
 Oh, God.
 Yeah, don't worry. Take a seat.
I don't even know how that happened.
I was in the military.
I trained for this.
And I don't want blood on my floor.
 Hey?
 Yep.
You got strong ankles.
Yes. I wear a lot of high heels for work.
All right. There you go.
Sorry. Force of habit.
It's all that military training.
And the tea was really lovely. Thank you.
Would it perhaps be more lovely if we added some brandy?
No. I'm just going to wait till my clothes have dried and then I'll pop off.
In two hours and 40 minutes.
Okay.
If you don't wanna wait, I can call a cab for you and your bag of wet clothes, or I can make dinner.
Well, yes, I am quite hungry actually.
And wet clothes are rather heavy in a bag, so... yes.
Fuck it. That'd be nice.
 Good! <i>Gezellig</i>?
 Yep.
Wait.
Feel free to change into one of these.
Should I be concerned that you've got a giant Tupperware box of women's clothing in your floating house?
These aren't trophies, are they?
No. It's my former partner. She was tall, like you.
I'm sorry. Did she pass away?
Unfortunately, no.
Please help yourself.
I... Look, I don't really think I can borrow your ex... God, this is lovely.
Please, change. We'll eat, and then you'll go, all right?
Yeah. Sure.
And after dinner I can give you a foot massage.
Absolutely not.
Are you sure? My technique is sound.
I'm sure it is, but I will pass.
Okay, then. Fine. Stand there with tired feet, completely sober.
It does not affect me at all.
Fine. Come on, then. I'll have a bit.
<i>Gezellig.</i> They put a dam on the river Amstel. "Amsteldam." Amsterdam. It's good, innit?
 Come on.
 Fucking stop for a fucking second!
Please.
God.
How do you know so much about here?
It's Amsterdam. How do you not?
Never been here in my life.
 What? Never?
 No.
 Not one stag party?
 No.
 Not one international match?
 No.
Not one emergency flight diverted here because some EasyJet passenger was being a prick?
 That never happens.
 It does.
It does happen, if you're being enough of a prick. Which I was.
It just looks like a Disney version of an old city.
It all looks so fucking fake.
It's not fake.
Come on. Windmills? Fake.
I ain't even from here, and I'm offended.
Windmills are real, man. What are you talking about?
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
We need bikes.
What? No.
 You know, Coach, if you wanna go...
 I'll see you in the morning.
Hey.
Hi. Can I help you?
Have you got vanilla vodka?
Dear God, no.
A beer, please. Thank you.
 There you go, sweetie.
 Thanks.
Hey, can I ask, do you know who I am?
Can I tell you a secret?
Tonight, you're whoever you want to be.
Yeah.
You should stick around for the party later on. Thunderdong.
Good vibes, good place to make friends.
Sounds fun, I'm in.
Trent! Hey.
Can I get a drink for my work acquaintance, please?
Sorry, did you say Thunderdong?
I think I'm in the wrong place. My mistake. Cheers.
Happens all the time.
Yeah.
 Colin!
 Good to see you, Trent.
Colin. I already knew.
I've known for months. I haven't said anything to anyone.
I must have a good reason for that, mustn't I?
Right.
Your ex has wonderful taste.
Well, actually, she hated that one.
Yeah, of course she did. I bought it for her.
Hey. <i>Gezellig</i>, right?
That smells wonderful.
It's almost ready.
Would you like a drink?
 I would love one.
 Please, help yourself.
So, should I be worried about some giant Dutch woman wandering on here and strangling me for wearing her clothes?
No.
Things are over between us, and have been so for some time. So don't worry.
It's all right. I didn't mean to...
You don't need to tell me any of the details.
She was unfaithful.
I loved her very much, so it wrecked me, and I came dangerously close to destroying our family on it.
But then, with time, I realized that this thing didn't happen to me, it happened for me. You know?
Cheers.
<i>Proost.</i>  Proost. Prost.
 <i>Proost.</i> Proust.
Wait, is this some Dutch bloke singing "She Believes in Me" by Kenny Rogers?
Whoa. This Dutch bloke is the great André Hazes, and he's singing "Zij Gelooft in Mij," all right?
Okay.
And yes, the Gambling Man did it first. But...
<i>And who knows Maybe on some special night</i> <i>If my song is right</i> <i>I will find a way</i>  The fuck are you doing?
 Just be patient.
Bicycle?
Thank you. Two, please.
I love a challenge. Hold this.
Mate. We've just made tonight amazing.
I don't wanna ride around on a fucking bike.
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.
 Voilà. Sixty euros.
 Have a hundred.
Thank you.
 Here.
 Get it away from me.
 Oh, come on.
 No, I don't want it.
Mate, we take the bikes, we find a windmill.
 No. I said no.
 Why the fuck not?
I don't know how to ride a bike!
No refunds.
Fucking hell, Roy. Do you know how to tie your own laces?
Stop being a dick.
When I went to Sunderland, my granddad told me he'd teach me how to ride when I came back for Christmas, and then he fucking died, and I haven't been on a bike since.
And now I'm saying that out loud, I realize that never learning was actually a great disrespect to his memory and now I feel ashamed. So can we stop talking about it and go back to me just taking out my negative emotions on you, even if you deserve it or not?
Go on, Roy. For Granddad.
Fuck.
Okay, you're gonna sit up, look up and pedal.
Straight back up. Just straight back up.
Put your feet on the pedals. Put your feet on the pedals.
That's it, good. Now pedal.
Put your foot on the ped...
All right. Okay. All right.
On the bike. Okay. There you go.
Pick it up but in an angry way, man.
Good lad. Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal. That's it. Hey!
Good lad, pedal it. You actually... That's it, that's it!
That's good! That's good.
You did it for two seconds there, man. That's an improvement.
Steady on, mate. Steady on.
Hey! What... You're doing well, man. Calm down.
How's that gonna help anyone?
In there. There you go. Good.
 I can't turn the other way.
 Yes. All right. This way.
 I can't turn the other way.
 It's right. Follow me.
 Try and hit me!
 I can't turn.
It's all about balance, man. Just like dribbling.
If you can dribble, you can balance. That's it.
Yeah, that's good. You do...
 All right, mate. It's good...
 I'm gonna kill you.
 You're doing it.
 I'm doing it.
Let's go find a fucking windmill!
For Granddad! All right, wait for me.
We're sitting here?
Well, yeah. You know, you said pick good seats, so...
Yeah, but these are so exposed.
Oh, no. It's like the time I was front and center at an improv comedy show.
Are they gonna make a song about how I look like an altar boy?
It's okay. You did great.
 Here's your drink.
 Thank you.
Thank you for doing this, Will.
One pilgrim alone is merely a zealot, but two pilgrims together, that's a pilgrimage.
Cheers.
Here we go.
Welcome to Jazz Café Alto. My name is Dante Charles, and we are the Kartel.
 Miles Davis once said that...
 Yeah.
<i>Remember the night</i> And that was the second time I came out to her.
This time, however, she believed me.
And now... we're closer than ever.
And your daughter?
Yeah. She's never been happier.
My point is, it was really difficult to hold on to that secret.
But I'm not a professional athlete.
How do you do it?
Well... my whole life is two lives really.
You got my work life.
Like, no one at the club knows.
I'd like to think they wouldn't care, but it's just easier that way.
Then you got my dating life.
Some guys think it's hot.
Others say they don't care, but eventually they get tired and they move on.
Then the club brought in Dr. Sharon...
and she helped me realize that I have...
an ache.
An ache for both my lives to be my only life.
I don't want to be a spokesperson.
I don't want a bunch of apologies.
All I want is for when we win a match, to be able to kiss my fella the same way the guys get to kiss their girls.
And I know we can't fix every ache inside of us.
But I shouldn't have to pretend it's not there either.
How'd you know? About me?
Well, I used my Holmesian powers of journalistic deduction.
Saw you kissing a guy outside Sam's restaurant.
Yeah.
Those are the bells of the Westerkerk.
Anne Frank heard those same bells every night.
She lived just there.
Right by this big, pink triangle?
Think that came a bit later.
Oh, yeah.
"One doesn't expect to get from life what one has already learned it cannot give, rather, one begins to see that life is a kind of sowing time...
and the harvest is not yet here." He was just a humble preacher's son.
And yes, he had his demons, but they never stopped him from searching for beauty.
Because when you find beauty, you find inspiration.
If, that is, you stay as determined as Vincent.
Never stop, no matter how many failures.
When you know you're doing what you're meant to do, you have to try.
Where I'm from...
Kansas, my home... This here, this is our state flower.
I want you to have this.
We close in three minutes.
Mercy buckets.
Yep.
We are in Holland! We should try Dutch food!
 As a Frenchman, I would rather die!
 No!
Enough!
We are riven by this crossroads!
Is this it?
Should we huddle around the laptop for a movie night?
How else do we proceed?
How doth we channel this lack of compromise?
This dissension? This rage?
Captain.
Coach. I know that you have my best interests at heart, or the club's anyway.
Even though you're clearly upset about something else and you're taking it out on me.
What I'm trying to say is, I'm sorry for being a dick earlier.
I've been to Amsterdam twice.
When I was 14, me dad was trying to get back with me mum, and he was acting like some kind of fucking super dad or some shit, and he brought me out here for some father-son bonding time.
Anyway, he said it was to watch a football match.
After the game, he took me to the red-light district for my real present.
He took me to lose my virginity to those ladies behind the windows.
Jesus. Must have been traumatizing.
No. She loved it.
For me... Sorry, me, you mean.
No.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Anyway, a couple of years later, me mum brought me back here.
And we went to museums and did all the tours, and it's the first time I had <i>stroopwafel</i>. Never forget that time.
Even though my dad weren't here, he was still kinda there with us. You know?
I was a dick today too. I'm sorry.
I think Keeley's got a girlfriend.
Let's go find us some windmills, eh?
Yeah.
Bang.
Howdy, partner.
Hey there.
Welcome to Yankee Doodle Burger Barn. Table for one?
Wh... Yes, please. Yeah. Hey, where in the States you from?
Melbourne.
Plenty of room tonight, where would you like to sit?
Windy City, Big Apple or Hollywood?
Oh, well. Tell Mama that Roxie Hart is coming home. Lipschitz.
Chicago.
Windy City.
Great, mate. Giddyap.
Here you are. Your fancy hot dog.
Howdy.
 Can I get some ranch dressing?
 Absolutely, ma'am.
Hey, partner. Here all right?
Yeah.
 Enjoy.
 Thank you.
 Oh, no, you didn't.
 Yes.
Well, it actually happened.
Would you like some water?
Wise.
This is so cozy.
The food and the music, the boat and...
It really is...
<i>Gezellig</i>?
You keep saying that word. Or are you just choking?
 <i>Gezellig</i>. That one?
 That's the one.
 Come on then. What does that mean?
 What...
I don't know. <i>Gezellig</i>.
There is no direct English translation, I think.
It can mean cozy. Like a warm fire.
<i>Gezellig</i>.
But you can also keep your mind <i>gezellig</i>.
You know, your heart, your soul. The people you're with. The places you go.
You know?
Even this, right now, here is...
<i>Gezellig</i>.
Exactly.
They feel pretty dry.
All right. Where were we?
Wine.
Here's your onion ring pyramid and your freedom fries.
Thank you.
You enjoying the game?
Oh, yeah. Hey, you know what?
I bet you a thousand bucks the Bulls will win 107 to 86.
I'm just kidding.
I remember watching this game as a kid with my dad.
Yeah. I used to love watching basketball with him.
Thank you for sharing.
And please feel free to choose from our menu of 50 Nifty United Sauces.
And there's a lovely queso from Puerto Rico.
You know what? How about you just surprise me?
 Can do.
 Thanks.
<i>And the Bulls drop into their triangle offense,</i> <i>creating constant movement between the players.</i> <i>It's been the key to their success this season.</i> <i>It opens up for Jordan. He shoots. Yes!</i> Pyramid ain't nothing but a triangle.
Actually, three triangles all leaning on each other.
Howdy, Ted.
Hey. So, how does this one look?
Why'd you bring me this one?
It's the best one.
Well, this is mighty strange.
Hello?
<i>Hello, Ted.</i> Hey, that's me. Who are you?
<i>I am the True Spirit of Adventure.</i> I like that. Well, what's shaking, TSA?
<i>Do you know where triangles come from, Ted?</i> I don't know. God dropped a square on the floor and it broke in half long-ways or something?
<i>- Whoopsie.
 No, Ted.</i> <i>It's debated that the triangle was first defined by Pythagoras</i> <i>as any shape with three sides and three corners.</i> That's a good theorem.
<i>But throughout history, many believe that triangles have held special powers.</i> Oh, yeah.
<i>From the Holy Trinity of Christianity to the trikaya of Buddhism.</i> <i>There's also that spooky eye thing on the back of the one-dollar bill.</i> Oh, yeah.
<i>In some Native American cultures, the triangle symbolizes home.</i> I'm sorry Europeans kicked all them folks out of their triangle.
<i>But the concept of the triangle reached its zenith in 1989</i> <i>when a man called Tex Winter, an assistant coach for your Chicago Bulls,</i> <i>introduced his triangle offense.</i> <i>The central component of which was</i> <i>for a player to always have two available teammates to whom he could pass the ball.</i> <i>These three players formed...</i> A triangle.
<i>Bingo, Ringo.</i> <i>But that was never the only triangle on the court.</i> <i>For when the players moved, they created more and more triangles.</i> Hey, you're right.
<i>Actually, Ted, you're right.</i> <i>Yes!</i> Howdy, partner.
Hey. Can I borrow a pen?
 Come on, boy!
 Thanks.
<i>Yankee Doodle Burger Barn Happy birthday</i> <i>Yankee Doodle Burger Barn Happy birthday, Mel</i> <i>World War II was won by America</i> <i>But the West was liberated Thanks to Canada</i> <i>Hey!</i> Do you play?
Yes, he... Yes, he does.
He plays bass because Chet Baker... Chet Ba... Do you know who Chet Baker is?
All right. Okay.
Players in.
Pillows ready.
Begin!
Let's get lost now.
Vanilla vodka.
 Oh, my God. He's still at it.
 Yeah. It's pretty amazing.
What the hell is he doing?
I don't know. But he's got my pen.
Derek's gonna make you buy a new one.
Fucking hate Derek.
Yeah.
Fuck!
<i>Let's get lost</i> Good morning.
So...
Last night...
Did we...
Did we?
Did we...
No.
Breakfast?
No. I have to go.
Of course.
But... thank you...
You're welcome...
I won't forget you.
Yeah, you might.
People get Alzheimer's.
Did we?
Oh, yes, we did.
I'm telling you, Amsterdam, amazing. Like, yes, we lost the game, but my boss played in a jazz band and then...
Gerbrandt, Gijs, Gilles, Brechje and Paul...
Okay, <i>doei.</i> <i>Doei</i>!
 Hey, Will.
 You speak Dutch?
Don't tell Jan. Where's Ted?
 He's in the back.
 Thank you.
Mum? Sorry. Yes, no... What was I saying?
And then I met the most lovely couple, and they invited me for a threesome.
<i>Bonjour</i>.
Coach.
Hey, Coach.
Wait, let me guess, Piggy Stardust.
 Rashers to rashers, oink to oinky.
 I love it.
Hey, sorry about last night.
No, that's okay. I'm sorry.
You know, I shouldn't have let you wander around out there all alone with a head full of tea, you know.
Good thing it was a dud batch.
What's that?
I wasn't feeling anything. So I called Kenneth, he tried it, couple hours later, calls me up totally contrite.
Confirmed, dud batch.
It happens.
Let me ask you a question here.
Is this anything?
The way I see it, we've been playing too rigid, you know?
Our guys need freedom.
Go wherever they wanna go. Follow their guts, their hearts.
As long as they remember to fill in the space that someone left behind.
They gotta have one another's backs, that's for sure.
But, you know, it's just constant, nonstop motion.
Just going from position to position until positions don't really even exist anymore.
It's fast, fluid, free.
With full support.
You come up with this yourself?
Yeah?
Congrats. You should call it Total Football.
I like that.
Which was invented right here in Holland in the '70s.
You think we should try it?
Yes, I do.
All right, cool. Total Football.
Room for one more?
Hey, boss.
So, 12 unanswered texts, three un-haha'ed GIFs.
We good?
I'm sorry, Ted. My phone is at the bottom of a canal.
Is that Keats?
Nope.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, Will, how we looking?
We're two short. Who's missing?
You lovely people!
Did you miss me?
Don't fucking ask.
Let's go.
We saw a windmill!
All right.
Hell yeah.
Come on!
I bet you the sex show was dope though.
 What?
 Leave it alone, man.
Everything okay, boss?
<i>Don't worry, about a thing</i> <i>'Cause every little thing's Gonna be all right</i> Well, I appreciate it.

@@@@@@
Mush!
Now, that's a cup of coffee. It's strong.
Good though.
I got you something.
I love somethings.
What is this?
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. I love this book.
I loved the movie more though.
Wait, is this, like, a first edition or something?
 Yep. And it's signed.
 No.
"Keeley, you go girl! Jane Austen." Did you destroy a priceless artifact just to make me laugh?
One, it wasn't priceless. It was actually very expensive.
Two, I can get very jealous, and I hate the idea of you regifting that.
And three, no, I didn't. That is all her.
And she really wants you to "go girl," so, you better go girl.
I'll go. Watch me.
Come here. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, Cindy. How are you? Good.
How you doing, brother? You okay?
 Good morning, Faridah.
 Morning, Sam.
Okay. I have a favor to ask.
Do we have an open table on Friday night?
You're being serious? No.
The restaurant is booked for months. The waiting list is a lie we tell people.
Okay. We have a very special guest coming, so I need a "Ray Liotta" for one.
I'll take care of it, take care of it.
You're the best.
 Okay. Thank you.
 Fuck you!
If you will excuse me.
 Is everything okay in here?
 I don't know.
 Is everything okay in here?
 Yes, Chef!
 Everything's fine.
 So who were you talking to?
 Brinda Barot.
 And was she here?
No, poo poo head.
A refugee boat's coming in, and our home secretary wants to send them away.
 Why would she do that?
 Because she's the devil.
 Right?
 Yes, Chef!
Okay, listen. Brinda Barot sucks for sure, but, Simi, it's way too early to be this angry.
Maybe you should start drinking coffee again. It's better for your heart.
Why are you here?
Is there a photo shoot for <i>Footballer Passion Project Magazine</i>, or something?
No, I just stopped by to make sure everything was okay.
Everything is perfect.
What about the spoons?
They don't match.
Samuel, if the food is good, which it is, no one cares about the spoons.
 Am I right?
 Yes, Chef!
You know, just... My father is coming this weekend.
So-- Fuck. And I just-- I want everything to be perfect.
He's coming all the way from Nigeria.
If this bitch lets him in.
All right, fellas, focus up here.
Right about now, Roy's gonna make things dark...
so that Coach Beard here can shed some light. Coach.
At the 1974 World Cup, the tiny country of the Netherlands came out of nowhere and made it all the way to the World Cup Final, playing the home team, heavily favored Germany.
Those Dutch hippies scored before the Germans even touched the ball.
Yeah, but Holland lost that game.
Correct. But along the way, they won the hearts of fans all around the world with a style of play-- dare I say, a philosophy-- called Total Football.
Which, coincidentally, Coach dreamed up in a barbecue-sauce-related hallucination just last week.
No, it's true. But hey, it's not about me. Go on, keep shining.
The best player on that team and the godfather of Total Football was this guy.
Can anyone tell me who this is?
That's Tim Robinson from <i>I Think You Should Leave</i>.
No. It is Dutch football legend, Johan Cruyff.
It's pronounced Cruijff.
My apologies. With Total Football,  Johan Cruijff...
 That's it.
... took his small club Ajax to three straight European titles.
Now, he later became a coach, first at Ajax, and then he took Total Football to Barcelona, where he won the Spanish championship four years in a row.
Now a central cog of that team was an industrious but brilliant midfielder named Josep Guardiola.
AKA Pep.
Look at that head of hair.
God had to take it away just to balance things out, you know?
Pep became a coach as well, honing his own version of Total Football that he took to Barcelona and Bayern Munich, eventually landing at our great white whale, Manchester City.
Where he briefly coached a very talented young player...
until that beautiful dum-dum quit to go do a reality show.
I was robbed!
Total Football is about constant movement. Players are no longer in set positions.
Defenders are free to attack. Attackers are trusted to defend.
It's about taking risks and supporting each other's choices.
Like when your friend wears something new and outside his comfort zone, and instead of ignoring it, everybody pays him a compliment.
By the way, great hat, Ash.
Oh, yeah.
 It's pretty sweet.
 Yeah, it frames his face nicely.
Exactly. Total Football is about letting go of your baggage and trusting your intuition.
It's jazz. It's Motown. It's Mamet. It's Pinter. It's Einstein.
It's Keurig. It's Gaga!
It's my mother proudly displaying her vibrator on the bedside table!
It's about throwing off the constraints put upon you by society and by yourselves!
We all know football is life.
But a beautiful life...
is Total Football.
That's good. That's you right there.
Give it up, that's Coach.
All right, fellas, we wanted y'all to know a little bit about the history of Total Football, because that's what we're gonna start playing here.
What? No. No, wait. What?
Oi! You turn those frowns upside down 'cause we're fucking doing this.
We're gonna drill it, we're gonna train it and then in a couple of months, we're taking Total Football to the fucking pitch.
No, actually we're gonna do it this Saturday against Arsenal.
 Well, that's fucking mental.
 No, it'll be fine.
Hush your butts!
Hush your butt! Let's go. come on.
No, no, no. Cool it. It's gonna be fine. I don't wanna hear it.
 Let's go, come on!
 I hear butts!
Hush your butt, hush your butt, hush your butt. Gotta hush them butts.
Isaac, come on, be a captain. Get that butt hushed.
I don't wanna hear it, Van Damme. Hush your butt.
Ms. Jones, we have a problem. The-- Oh, no, wait, actually, no, we don't.
Sorry, sort of force of habit or something.
 I'm just dropping this off.
 Thank you.
That's very lovely. May I?
Yeah, of course, go.
I never would've thought that you liked books.
I mean, that you collect first editions.
Oh, no, I don't. That was a gift from Jack.
Wow. What a very nice gift to receive. From your boss.
She's not really my boss, right? She's helping me execute my vision.
It must be nice to have such a generous friend that, delivers expensive gifts to your place of work.
No, no. She gave it to me this morning when we had breakfast together.
Coffee. We had a coffee together.
At a coffee shop. But we didn't arrive together.
We came from separate places, and we met there.
She was late actually.
Well, I had a warm yogurt on the tube in my pajamas.
You take the tube in your pajamas?
Yeah, sometimes, yes. When I want to beat the rush.
And then I just get changed in the toilets when I get here.
Smart.
 Ms. Jones.
 Barbara.
 Hey, Siri.
 <i>Yes, Wunderkind?</i> Could you set a reminder for tomorrow at 7:00 p. m.
for Nicole's birthday dinner? Thank you.
<i>Okay, your reminder is set for tomorrow at 7:00.</i>  Siri.
 <i>Yes, Wunderkind?</i> How can you tell if a girl likes you or is just being nice to you?
<i>You can't.</i> So now I'm starting to get all these subtle, little hints from Jane.
Like, certain magazines left on the coffee table and always hearing about her friends who are doing it.
Well, marriage is a big commitment, you know?
No, I'm talking about pegging.
Well, still.
Wait, what magazines?
 Here you go, lads.
 Thanks, Mae.
 You okay, Mae?
 No.
We win, this place is packed. We lose, it's like this.
I actually prefer it. You can finally hear yourself think in here.
Fuck off.
Hey, Lasso. We wanted to apologize.
 What for?
 For getting all soft on you.
Yeah, we humanized you and lost all objectivity.
Main reason why farmers don't name their livestock.
And why we don't learn the names of Baz's brother's girlfriends anymore.
Because he's a male whore.
Exactly. So we're gonna backslide a little bit.
Now what the fuck are you doing to our team, wanker?
 Okay.
 You-- Well-- Now, hold on, hold on, hold on, Coach.
Well, I tell you what, fellas.
Why don't you come watch training tomorrow? See for yourselves.
We ain't running a chocolate factory or Deutsche Bank.
We got nothing to hide from y'all. See you tomorrow?
Yeah. You will.
What?
 Should I wear a suit?
 I'm definitely gonna take a shower.
 I mean, gotta do that. Yeah, definitely.
 Yeah.
Coach, you sure it's smart to invite fans to our practices?
It's their team. We're just borrowing it for a little while. You know?
Anyway, I guess marriage and pegging aren't really that different.
Yeah, it's all about compromise.
 There he is!
 God! Sorry.
The hottest coach in the league!
Thank you.
I won a lot of money off your lot. So, keep it up. Please.
Table for one?
No, I thought I'd-- Just passing. Is Jade working today? Do you know?
No, she's off Tuesdays. She goes to school.
Or feeds her mum. I don't listen, so I don't really know.
Okay. Well, just say that I said hello.
Actually, you know what, don't say anything.
Actually, no, do. Say, if you-- No. Just don't say anything. Unless she asks after me.
In which case, just say that I said hello.
 And why would she ask after you?
 Exactly. I don't kn-- Thank you, Derek.
Thank you. Bye. Yes, no, just-- Yeah.
All right.
 Hey, Trent.
 Hello, Ted.
 Hey, Ted!
 Hey, fellas!
The fuck are they doing here?
I don't know. Ask Beard, he's the one who invited them.
All right, my Merry Pranksters.
If we're gonna play Total Football, there are four things we need to focus on.
All right? Number one, conditioning. Y'all gotta get into even better shape.
Number two, versatility. Number three, awareness.
And number four...
I don't know what that one is yet. But I know it's important.
Starting today, we're gonna have to turn things up a notch around here.
So I'ma hand it over to your drill instructor, Sergeant Roy Kent.
Whistle! On your feet, maggots!
Right.
Today you're gonna run from end to end to end to end.
But lucky for you, I'm in a good mood.
So you've only gotta do that for the whole fucking practice.
Whistle.
 Why doesn't he just use a whistle?
 He's allergic to metal.
Football stars, they're just like us.
Run!
You sure you don't want a plastic whistle?
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Cute flowers.
 Thanks.
Yeah, daisies are my favorite.
 And I thought I was.
 Wait!
Why'd you do that?
Shit, you're right, yeah.
 No. Off. On. On?
 Keeley. Keeley.
 On or off? Off? On or off?
 Keeley. Keeley, s--  On? On. Do you want it on or off?
 Keeley. Keeley.
 On or off? Off? On? Off or on?
 Stop. Give it to me. Thank you.
 What's going on?
 I'm sorry.
I am just not built for a secret office romance.
I'm used to everyone knowing everything about me.
Barbara saw the book that you gave me, and, I didn't think that I could tell her that we were dating, because I don't want us to get in trouble.
We can't get into trouble 'cause we are two consenting adults.
And I'm get-away-with-murder rich, so...
 Really?
 Yeah.
 Like who else? Name names.
 Everyone connected to Epstein.
Keeley, I don't care if people in the office know we're dating, do you?
No, of course not. I just didn't know how serious you were about this.
Come with me.
Okay.
Hey, everyone. Quick announcement.
Keeley and I are dating.
And it's brand-new, but I'm serious about it.
And so both of us just wanted to let you all know so that there were no secrets.
'Cause it's all good. I'm not crazy. She's not crazy.
You're not crazy, right?
Neither of us are crazy.
But, if any of you have any issues or concerns about this at all, please do not hesitate to come and speak to me or Keeley or Barbara.
Cool?
Cool.
And congratulations, Jack and Keeley.
 Love is love, i-- Right.
 No, that's enough, Dan. Thank you.
This is some of the best puking I've ever seen.
Yeah, me too. And we spend most of our lives at the pub.
All right. Nice job, gentlemen. Okay, that's it for today.
Now we scrimmage!
Honestly, my jacket's still a bit canal-y.
It's really bad.
Okay, so, you never got his name?
And you never told him yours?
Yeah, see, that part's not that weird to me.
If you really didn't have sex with the guy, now that is fucking bonkers.
Look, what we shared, it just-- It transcended sex. It was...
 Magic.
 <i>Gezellig</i>.
But, yeah, I would've liked to have seen his penis.
 It is so good to see you.
 You too.
It has been way too long.
Because I've lost you to another woman.
 I know. I'm sorry.
 I am joking.
So come on. How's it going?
It is great. I mean, she is so cool.
She's smart. Super foxy.
She's an amazing gift-giver.
Oh, my God, and the way she proclaimed our relationship to the entire office.
It was so fucking hot.
I think she might be love bombing you.
 She's "love what-ing" me?
 Love bombing.
That's when you're bombarded with expensive gifts and trips and grand gestures of love.
They call it love bombing.
 Who does?
 I don't know. They do.
Those "they" out there that name stuff.
But what I do know is that on my second date with Rupert-- Second date, he took me to a car showroom and said, "Which one do you want?" I would fucking love that.
What did you do?
Well, I asked him if he was referring to the cars or the beautiful saleswomen suddenly tripping over themselves to help us.
And?
I drove home in a bloody lovely Jaguar, of course.
It just felt nice to be taken care of for once.
Look, I'm not saying that Jack is like Rupert.
But sometimes shiny things can tarnish.
I think it's fine.
Okay, good. Good.
Just trust yourself.
I ignored so many red flags in my past.
Yeah. Well, maybe we're love blind?
Love blind. What's that?
It's an emotional version of color blindness where a person interprets red flags as giant green, just-fucking-go-for-it flags.
 Did you come up with that?
 Yeah, I did.
Oh, my God. You're one of those "they" that name stuff.
 Shit, I think I might be.
 I think you might be.
Sorry, excuse me. Could we get the bill, please? Thank you.
Actually, the bill was already taken care of by Jack.
She said she hopes you both enjoyed your meal.
What a massive surprise.
 Wow, yeah.
 What?
Well, then I think we ought to have some tiramisu. Don't you?
 Definitely.
 And two bottles of the '34 Château Cheval Blanc Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru to go.
And one for yourself.
Happy birthday, Mum.
Wow.
I love it.
Well, it was my vision, but Uncle Nate made it happen.
She was actually quite specific. So...
Thank you, cheeky. Thanks, Nate.
Let's have a look, love. It's lovely.
So, come on.
You're the hottest coach in the Premier League, which makes me the coolest lawyer in the firm.
Please tell me you're hooking up with girls left and right.
Okay, I don't think this kind of talk is appropriate for a young lady.
 Who wants ice cream?
 I do.
Great. Let's go to the corner shop.
Ali, come with us. Let them have their girl talk.
Come on, love. See you in a little bit.
Bye.
Okay, tell me everything.
Okay. Well, there's this girl I like.
She's the hostess at Taste of Athens.
She used to hate me, but now she-- Well, I don't know.
I've misread signals from women before, but-- I mean, how do you tell if a girl likes you or is just being nice to you?
You can't.
But there is one surefire way to find out.
 Right.
 Ask her out.
No, I can't-- Can't do that. No.
Come on, what is the worst that could happen?
Well, that she laughs in my face and says no.
And that I scurry away, humiliated, never to be allowed in my favorite restaurant ever again.
So that next time we have some kind of family celebration, I'll just have to, you know, sit on the pavement outside eating takeaway fish and chips, watching you through the window like some Dickensian street urchin.
Oh, my God.
He's just like Dad. You have to show him the map.
No, your father would kill me.
 Show him the map.
 What map?
Your father and I went to school together for years, but I didn't think he even knew I existed, until he gave me this.
"Distance between the places that we were born, 4,125 miles.
Distance between the places that we were raised, 4,230 miles.
Distance between our dorms on campus, 1.3 miles.
Distance between us on Friday night at 8:00 p. m., hopefully one foot.
Would you like to go on a date?" Stop waiting, Nathan.
Yes, you could fail and be embarrassed for a second.
But you could also get married, have two wonderful children and live happily ever after.
 Oh, shit.
 We're back.
Quick, distract him.
<i>... that is carrying a large group of refugees,</i> <i>including several women and children, who are hoping to claim asylum in the UK.</i> What's going on?
<i>... in Portsmouth.</i> <i>The boat is now kilometers from Portsmouth Harbor,</i> <i>where its passengers, dozens of refugees, hope to find sanctuary.</i> <i>Hundreds of supporters await their arrival.</i> <i>While others, such as Home Secretary Brinda Barot, had this to say.</i> <i>To anyone attempting to enter our country illegally, I say this.</i> <i>"Go home. Britain is closed."</i> <i>Over the last few days--</i>  What a stupid idiot.
 What a piece of shit.
You know, someone needs to send her back to where she came from.
 Her mother's butthole. Right?
 Yes, Chef!
Or somebody could try and speak to the better angels of this clearly misguided person.
- Bitch.
 What?
It should say, "Help make Britain better than this bitch." I think I'll stick with mine.
Yeah.
- Hi.
 Hello there.
Nate.
There's something that I wanted to ask you. Would you...
Excuse me one moment.
So sorry. Sorry.
Actually, there's one thing I need to do first. Sorry.
Whistle. Bring it in.
All right, fellas. How y'all feeling?
Bumbercatch, did you just puke whole Cheerios?
Yes, Coach. I like to eat my breakfast without chewing.
To conserve my energy in case an impending class war breaks out.
Yeah, no, makes sense. I get it. Yeah.
All right, gentlemen, today we are gonna focus on versatility.
Now, in Total Football, you gotta constantly be asking yourself, "What does this situation need right now?" You know, do I need to drop back and replace Jan Maas on defense?
Or, you know, should I attack like Jamie?
Or, you know, or do I lend Roy here a piece of gum because his breath smells like dookie?
Completely hypothetical. Don't worry. You're fine, you're fine.
All right? You gotta be able to jump in anywhere at any time.
And the way to do that well is to understand and appreciate everyone's position and every position's function.
That's why we got our man, Beard, replacing Will today as our kitman.
Yeah. So when we get out here and we scrimmage, y'all are gonna be swapping positions with someone else. Yeah?
For example, you know, Isaac, we're gonna move you up to forward.
And Dani, we're gonna drop you back to defense. Got it?
I'm gonna be Dani Rojas?
That's right, Isaac. And Dani is gonna be you. Make sense?
We're gonna fuck 'em up, bruv.
<i>Ay, Dios mios.</i> Y'all don't need to do the voices.
 Come on.
 Okay, all right. Y'all can do the voices.
Yeah.
You go ahead, Roy. Help 'em out here.
Roy's gonna be handing out paper that's got someone's name on it.
That's the name of the person you're gonna do the swaparoo with.
 Everybody understand?
 Yes, Coach.
All right, good. Coach, I miss anything?
 That's it, baby. Let's go!
 All right, let's do it. You heard him.
Here we go, boys. Here we go.
 There you go, Coach.
 Thank you, Coach.
Hey, Coach. There's been a mistake. I got me.
Oh, no, Jamie, that's not a mistake.
We just figured you'd wanna keep doing what you do best for us.
Playing striker and scoring goals, right?
Yeah.
 Yeah, if you want, yeah.
 Great.
 Okay.
 Have fun out there.
Yeah.
That is yummy. What is this?
Water.
 I'm wide.
 Let's go! Let's go!
Nice try, Van Damme. You tried your best, and we love you.
Baz, what are you doing?
I'm switching positions with Paul.
You know, unwavering positivity.
Nice job with the water bottles, Coach Beard.
You fucking twats!
I don't like it. I actually prefer to be me.
Hold up.
Dani. Come on, now. You're a center back, remember?
That ain't your job taking corners. That's what Isaac does now.
 Right. Right, Coach.
 Isaac, come on, man. You're up.
 All right, Isaac.
 Let's go.
 You've got this, bruv.
 All right, now.
Coach, I ain't never taken a corner before.
No, I know. That's 'cause you were put into a box, Isaac.
As a ten-year-old little boy with the strength and facial hair of a grown man.
The box of a center back who was never allowed to take a corner kick.
Well, my friend, that box ceases to exist today.
Yeah? Go on.
What do you want me to do?
I don't know. Just kick the hell out of it.
Okay.
Hot! Hot tea.
Just a bit outside.
Ted. I just want to make sure I have this right.
You're gonna change tactics at this stage in the season and replace it with a totally new method that the boys are clearly struggling to understand.
And you think this is a good idea?
Well, Trent, the way I see it, it's kind of like taking a hike with Robert Frost.
It could go either way.
 Get the fuck out of my chair.
 Yeah, no, of course. Sorry.
Oh, my God.
Okay, Greyhounds. Today we're talking about number three, awareness.
When you play Total Football, you gotta know what your teammates are doing at all times.
Constant movement requires constant concentration, yeah?
So if Sam makes a run through the center, y'all gotta shift, right?
And if Dani moves back on defense, that means what?
Hell has frozen over?
No, it means you've gotta move up and support Dani's choice.
Okay, any questions so far?
Yeah, Coach. What's with the red string?
Great question.
In Japanese culture, they have a myth where they believe that all soulmates are connected by an invisible red string.
And those strings are attached to each of their little fingers.
Okay, so why is it tied around our dicks?
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, you know, that was Roy's idea.
But I'm pretty sure the thought behind it is that it is nearly impossible to not be fully aware of what your teammate's doing when y'all got a rope tied around your dingdong.
Am I right about that, Roy?
Yeah. Something like that.
Okay, great. Yeah.
So we gonna get after this right now, gonna do a full scrimmage at half speed.
And I don't wanna see them strings get too loose.
And I'll leave it up to y'all to make sure they don't get too tight.
Do not leave my side.
Shall we?
"Dicks" on three. One, two, three.
 Dicks.
 Come on, let's move.
Figure it out! This is what we're doing.
Fucking hell. Look at me, man.
I'm attacking. I'm attacking.
I'm defending. I'm defending.
Jan!
Look what Kent gave me. In case we wanted to--  No.
 No fucking way.
 You wanna give him a little space, Dani.
 Sorry, Coach, I am too scared.
Bro, do you wanna...
It's okay. His penis is okay.
Oh, my God.
I thought I just ripped Jamie's knob off.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.
Okay.
Hi!
Hi.
Sorry that I am late.
I'm in no rush. I got you something.
I don't want it.
Sorry.
I'm sure whatever it is, it is incredibly thoughtful and mind-blowingly generous.
But I don't want it.
 Keeley, I just got you a--  No, I don't even wanna know what it is.
No. I just wanna hang out one time where it doesn't feel like you're sweeping me off my feet.
Okay. Sorry for sweeping you off your feet.
No. Hey, I didn't mean-- No. It's okay. I get it. It's absolutely what I'm doing.
I'm coming on too fast or too strong, I'm sorry. I'll back off.
But just a little bit.
It was a croissant. I got you a croissant.
Oi. You're incredible.
But you've gotta let me do something for you every once in a while.
Deal.
Thank you.
But it better be fucking amazing.
It's the last one, I swear.
Verdict?
It's a really, really good croissant.
Would you like to go on a date with me?
Yes.
Good.
There wasn't anything alive in there, was there?
Oh, no. No, no. No, not at all.
If you say so.
There you go, sir.
I've given this a lot of thought.
Next time we do this drill, we tie multiple guys' dicks to one guy's dick.
Yeah?
That was a one-shot deal, Roy.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we cooked that whole bird already, Coach.
Shame.
So, Ted.
 This number four.
 Yes, sir.
 You haven't said what it is yet.
 No, ma'am.
 But you know what it is?
 I don't actually.
 What about you, Coach?
 I'm agnostic.
 Roy?
 I don't fucking know.
Number four has yet to reveal itself.
There is no number four?
Like the man once said, "Sometimes you gotta leave space to let God walk into the room." So, number four is God?
Oh, no. I don't think so. Coach?
 I'm an atheist.
 Roy?
I fucking hope not.
Oi, man, you're ten minutes late, yeah? That's gonna be a hundo, all right?
The fuck's wrong with you?
I'll tell you what's wrong.
The world is full of evil people who do shitty things.
But I can't deal with that because I have to kick a little ball around.
Which those same people love me for!
That is until I fuck up or I miss a penalty.
Or I decide to fight back, and then they're just gonna wanna ship me back wherever I fucking came from.
Samuel!
It's okay.
You know, I still want to go see it.
No. I can't take you there.
No. Not the way it looks now.
Do you know how long it will take you to reopen?
I don't know if I will.
 Samuel.
 What?
Why? For who? Just so somebody can go and trash it again.
You do it for yourself.
For your friend Simi.
For all those people who want a taste of home when they are away.
Follow your heart, Samuel.
Anger will only weaken you.
Yeah. Okay.
But if you really want to piss off the people who did this, forgive them.
What?
Forgive them. Big whoop.
 Big whoop?
 Big whoop.
My son, listen to me.
Don't fight back. Fight forward.
Thank you, Daddy.
Do you think I should invest in security cameras?
Hell yes. And gates.
Please tell me you have insurance.
I have insurance.
Thank God. Otherwise, your mother would have killed me.
 Are you gonna have any trouble?
 No. Insurance!
Hey. I'm sorry to interrupt y'all.
Sam, we're getting ready to start out there.
But, you know, if you wanna sit out today, I totally understand.
 Thank you, Coach.
 No, he's going to practice.
 Okay. Well, you better go change then.
 I'm getting ready to change.
Uh-huh. Okay.
It's really nice to finally meet you, sir.
You too.
You know, I almost wore that exact same thing today.
Funny guy.
 Hey, you like American candy?
 Who doesn't?
Yeah. Come on. It's got that bad sugar.
 Yeah. High-fructose corn syrup.
 That's too many words. I say "bad sugar." At the beginning, Rupert bought me so many tulips for so long,  his florist was able to buy a castle.
 What?
I mean, it was in Scunthorpe, but still. A castle.
Well, I'm taking Jack out tonight.
And if she tries to pay, then I will give her-- You'll give her what?
Just the tip?
 Hello, everyone.
 Hello, Leslie.
May I present...
Mr. Obisanya.
Rebecca Welton. Lovely to finally meet you.
Likewise. Samuel has told me so much about you.
Has he?
Yes. He has.
Cool.
Oh, yeah! Come on, you Greyhounds!
Let's go Richmond!
I'm Keeley, by the way. Hi.
Hey. Let's go, Greyhounds.
Come on.
 Bumber! Bumber! Shot!
 Push, man!
Bumber! No.
Richmond have been mired in a run of poor form, and you have to applaud Ted Lasso's efforts to try something new. But this-- What's the word I'm looking for, Chris?
"Sucks," Arlo. The word is "sucks." <i>It's like they've never played the sport before.</i> <i>Good grief, they're tackling themselves now.</i> <i>With Richmond literally running into each other,</i> <i>the Gunners mount a counterattack.</i> <i>Here's a through ball to Parslow. Parslow over to Hamilton...</i> <i>And he's there!</i> <i>Hamilton has his hat trick, and Arsenal leads 3-nil.</i> Fuck!
Okay.
It's all right.
It's over. We're gonna get relegated again, and I'm gonna have to go back to filling the sausages with cardboard.
Patience, Mae.
Just need to give it some time.
Ask yourself, what does this situation need?
<i>And at the half, Arsenal have a three-goal lead,</i> <i>and Richmond have plenty to talk about.</i> <i>Yeah, with fun conversation starters like, "Why are we so bad?"</i> <i>or "Should we just go home?"</i> Jamie, you keep floating back, mate.
You gotta stay up front.
We need you to stretch the defense.
We need you to score a fucking goal.
But how can we when we can't see anyone out there.
There's no shame in going back to the good old 4-4-2.
Until we've had more time to properly train.
Make you look like a prick.
For fuck's sake. What's the matter with you anyway?
Hey, fellas. Listen up here.
Well, I remember back in the early days of my coaching career, feeling compelled to express my individuality.
Since I was a straight fella in Middle America working in sports and I was scared of tattoo needles, the only real option for me to do so was through my facial hair.
And obviously I couldn't grow a beard.
Otherwise, Coach and I here would, look like a ZZ Top cover band.
 Would've been called "Sharp Dressed Men."  That's nice.
God, I hate what you've fucking done to me.
Luckily, around that time there was this quartet of stand-up comedians known as the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.
And along with their observational humor, fun banter and numerous catchphrases, they also possessed the four most common types of facial hair.
Now, Ron White, who was my favorite, he was clean-shaven.
That's one way to go.
But then you had Larry the Cable Guy, and he had himself a big old, bushy goatee.
And Bill Engvall, he also had a goatee actually.
But it was, you know, smaller and more manicured.
Not touching the sides here.
 Also known as a Vandyke.
 Thank you, Coach.
And then you had Jeff Foxworthy of course, who had a mustache.
So, check it out. I went ahead and rolled the dice and grew myself one of them big, bushy Cable Guy goatees.
And I thought I looked great.
Until Coach Beard here took me aside, right as I was about to walk down the aisle, and told me something I needed to hear. Remember what you said to me?
"Your goatee makes it look like you ate out bigfoot's butthole." That's right.
 AKA "ass-squatch."  You're on fire.
 Make it stop.
 No, no.
Coach was right though. Not a good look. Not on this face.
So I shaved that puppy down right into a Foxworthy, and I never looked back.
Point is, a lot of times the right idea is just sitting behind a couple of the wrong ones.
Yeah?
You got something you wanna say, Jamie?
 I mean, yeah. But...
 Great. Let us have it.
Well, I don't want people to think I'm being a prick if I say it.
Okay. Well, then.
I ain't doing it wrong.
You're doing it wrong.
I mean-- No, I mean, I think we're all doing it wrong.
If we want this to work, you gotta stop going to me and start playing through me. You get me?
Look. Just look. Look.
 Can I? Do you mind if I-- Right.
 Yeah, of course.
So look, I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't be playing forward.
I should be here, in the center.
I should be here, right? Let Dani go up front.
Move Colin over there. Richard there.
So, stop going to me, right? And start going through me. All right?
That's Total Football.
How's that sound to y'all?
That actually works.
And there it is. <i>Número cuatro</i>. Sacrifice.
Putting aside personal glory on behalf of the team.
I like that. But that ain't number four.
 Let's bring it in! Come on.
 Let's go for "four" on three.
 One, two, three--  Four!
<i>The Greyhounds still 3-nil down, in this second half.</i> <i>They need something, and they need it soon.</i> <i>Arsenal's cross, easy for Van Damme. And Van Damme out to Jan Maas.</i> Here we go.
<i>Here's Dixon. Infield to Tartt.</i> <i>Tartt to Obisanya. Over to Hughes.</i> <i>Tartt again.</i> <i>To McAdoo in the midfield.</i> <i>Over to Rojas.</i> <i>Rojas drops it back to Tartt.</i> <i>Who sends a long ball down to Bumbercatch.</i> <i>Bumbercatch to Goodman.</i>  <i>Goodman over to Tartt...</i>  Yeah.
<i>... in the box.</i> <i>Old Tartt with the back heel.</i> <i>And Montlaur is there to hammer it in!</i> That was bloody gorgeous!
<i>A majestic, sweeping symphony of a goal with Tartt in the role of conductor.</i> Hey! All right!
 That's it right there.
 There we go. There we go!
<i>Arsenal prevails 3-1.</i> <i>But for the first time in weeks, the Greyhounds are showing signs of life.</i> Ted.
It's going to work.
 Great. What is?
 Total football.
 Okay. Why?
 And I'll tell you why.
The Lasso way.
 You haven't switched tactics in a week.
 I haven't?
 No. You've done this over three seasons.
 I have?
Yes. By slowly but surely building a club-wide culture of trust and support through thousands of imperceptible moments, all leading to their inevitable conclusion.
 Total Football.
 Well, how about that.
It's gonna work.
Doesn't even matter what number four is.
What a fucking dork.
Yeah. But he's our dork.
 Hey.
 Hi.
 All right to sit?
Of course. Yeah, take a seat.
Thank you.
Wow. You look great. Thank you for coming.
 Thank you for coming?
 You know...
Did you think I was gonna stand you up?
No. Do you want a drink? Sorry, I ordered.
 No, that's fine.
 Just got nervous.
Please. Here we are, and there you go.
Best table in the house. As requested.
You little love bomber.
I know it's not the outcome you wanted, but I'm very proud of the way you and your team played today.
Thanks, Dad.
And I met Rebecca.
 Oh, no. Did you make things weird?
 Yes.
 Do you want to go and see the restaurant?
 I would love to.
I don't know, Dad, I wish-- I wish you could've seen it when it was done up. It was perfect.
This looks nice.
 Daddy, it's not the same.
 It isn't so bad.
Yo, look who's here.
Hey.
The surprise is ruined.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we all just asked ourselves, "What does this situation need?" And we thought your situation needed us.
Yeah, got my cousin to fix your window this morning.
Didn't get a discount though, 'cause he's a prick.
And I brought some cases of wine from my personal cellar.
Not the best stuff obviously, but still very, very good.
And Bumbercatch is trying to fix your sign.
Neon signs are just a bunch of illuminated, gas-discharge tubes.
So I thought I'd give it a shot. Screwdriver.
Guys, this is incredible. Honestly.
Thank you all so very much.
 We got you, man.
 No worries.
 Great work, Van Damme.
 Simi.
Sam.
Oh, my God.
 Was this your idea?
 No, they called me.
 It's amazing, right?
 It's-- There's somebody I'd love for you to meet.
 Okay.
 Simi, this is my father.
So very nice to meet you, Simi. Sam has told me so much about you.
 Has he?
 Yes, he has.
Well, it's lovely to meet you too, Mr. Obisanya.
No. My father was Mr. Obisanya. Call me Ola.
Don't worry. I'll order the new mirrors on Monday.
No. No. Let's keep them.
I think they serve as a good reminder that everything doesn't have to be perfect.
And if the food is good, who cares about the mirrors?
Exactly.
Speaking of, who's hungry?
Yes!
Good. So I will cook you all dinner.
Sam, Simi, follow me.
Yes, Chef!
Apps are up.
Come on, let me help you, child.
 
@@@@@@
<i>Jamie Tartt collects.</i> <i>He's been Richmond's unequivocal talisman today.</i> <i>He finds Rojas and it's there!</i> <i>Richmond have beaten Aston Villa three-nil,</i> <i>with an offensive display as dazzling as it is unfamiliar.</i> <i>AFC Richmond make it two decisive wins in a row.</i> <i>Southampton never knew what hit them.</i> <i>Bumbercatch with a 95th-minute winner over Tottenham.</i> <i>The dog track has gone absolutely potty!</i> Another sensational win for Richmond away at Everton.
That's four in a row. Amazing. Life is good for the Greyhounds.
It's a lucky streak. What goes up always comes down.
<i>Exciting times on Nelson Road,</i> <i>and you have to think that no one is happier than Coach Ted Lasso.</i> I'm glad this little trip worked out for y'all.
Yeah. Henry's really excited to spend the weekend with you.
Oh, yeah. Well, you know...
I'll take face-to-face time over FaceTime anytime.
Yeah. And you know, I wanna say, it's been nice to...
get to remeet you, Dr. Jacob.
Ted, please. I insist, just call me Jake.
You got it, Jake.
Oh, nope. Still feels weird to me, you know?
Like whenever I hear white folks call Jay-Z "Jigga man," you know?
Or like when you see a priest wearing shorts.
Yeah, exactly. Weird, you know?
Or when you get pulled over by a cop who's the same age as you.
You're like, "Come on, man, be cool.
What we doing here?" You know?
Can I get some more money for the pinball, please?
 Yeah, let's see--  Yeah.
 You go. You go ahead.
 Okay.
I don't know what I have. Let's see.
There are some magnets I gotta bring back to work and a matchbook.
Maybe I do. Let me just see. I got-- No.
A pocketful of American coins and a complimentary sleep mask that did not fit 'cause I have a huge head.
Come on, Prince Henry. I rigged the machine so you can play without coins.
You said that was impossible.
Here you go. Two English breakfasts. Enjoy.
Thank you.
Nothing's impossible.
I should wash my hands 'cause I touched dirty money.
I'm a hand-wash guy, Ted.
Yeah.
He's a hand-wash guy.
 Well, better safe than sorry.
 Yeah. Right?
 Are you sure you're not hungry?
 No, I'm good.
I had a big old piece of cereal at home.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
Besides, you know, English breakfast to me is just a pile of a bunch of little, tiny piles, you know?
But please, help yourself.
You're gonna need your strength, hiking around that English countryside.
Oh, yeah. About that.
Yeah?
Jake told me on the plane he's actually taking me to Paris.
It was a surprise.
Paris.
Great, yeah. Which one?
You know, Paris, Texas? Paris, Arkansas? Paris, Ohio? Or the other Paris in Ohio?
Actually, I think there's three Parises in Ohio.
Or do you say "Parese"? Par-- "Paris" Paris. You know, in France.
The default Paris.
Right.
Cool. Well, that's gonna be real...
I wish I knew the French word for "nice." <i>Très bien.</i> <i>Très bien.</i> You know, I think hooking up with you might just be my favorite thing ever.
Yeah?
Yeah. Well, second favorite.
Go on then.
Sorry.
There goes my boner.
My dad told my Uncle Bernie I'm in town, and he's invited me to his big, swanky polo event tomorrow. Would you wanna go?
The one time I've been on a horse was for a photo shoot years ago.
Horse was so drugged up that it could've been the guitarist in the Sex Pistols.
No, we don't play.
We just stand around and drink champagne.
- Oh, right. Of course, yeah.
 It's for charity.
You know, celebrities, red carpet, big trays of tiny food.
It's a whole thing. We should go.
Be fun to show off my girlfriend.
Sounds great. And it gives me an excuse to go to Harvey Nicks!
Okay, I'll tell Uncle Bernie. He's gonna love you.
I didn't know your dad had a brother.
No, sorry. "Uncle" Bernie is a family friend.
- Bernard Arnault. He runs--  Moët and Louis Vuitton!
 Does he need another fake niece?
 You can ask him yourself tomorrow.
That's very cool.
More importantly...
 where were we?
 Champagne.
Harvey Nicks.
Fake uncles.
Drugged horses.
Oh, fuck.
 Hey. Morning.
 Morning.
That was nice.
You staying over, I mean. Not the...
Well, that-- Obviously, that was nice as well. I don't-- - Your breath smells good.
 Thank you.
Did you go off and brush your teeth and then sneak back into bed?
Yeah, I did.
Does my breath smell awful?
Yeah, it does, ac-- Yeah, it is quite bad.
So, look, would you want to go and grab some breakfast?
I don't know if you've got plans or what.
No, breakfast sounds good.
You know, I don't have any meals planned with anybody else in the foreseeable future.
I don't know. Do you?
No, I don't.
So if someone were to ask about us, what terminology would you best recommend describes our relationship?
No, there's no pressure to label us...
you and I. I just-- Yeah.
- All right.
 Yeah.
Yeah, no, 'cause I'm just cool.
Just cool and casual. I just-- Me too. Wait. Did you shave?
Yeah, and showered. After I used the toilet in next door's flat.
Weird.
Wow.
<i>Hi, baby. I know you're all the way up there in chilly Newcastle,</i> <i>so here's a little something to warm you up.</i> Nope. You're right. I shouldn't watch it.
Shit. How did that get on the Internet? A private video that-- Apparently, there's been some massive leak. It's not just you.
It's actresses, singers, a couple politicians, some random reality show guy with a very big dick.
Oh, my God. I can't believe this is happening. I-- How did that-- Fuck! Fuck.
Hey. Hey, hey.
No, this is bad, because my friends are gonna see this. My family.
 The team.
 Take a breath.
Oh, my God, and the office. I'm their boss.
Keeley, stop. Take a breath.
Yeah.
I'm so sorry this is happening.
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take care of it, okay?
Thank you.
Okay, Henry. We have scored excellently on kit presentation.
Hanger integrity: insane.
But we did drop a little on the towel folding, didn't we?
But that's okay. I've been there. But that does lead us on to our next task, which is towel placement.
The question is, are you ready?
Yeah.
Are you steady?
Yeah.
In that case, go!
Is this a game or child labor?
In late-stage capitalism, what's the difference?
 Word.
 You're doing really well, Henry.
Then we'll go into the weight room and do some cleaning next. That'll be great.
Hey, fellas, let me ask you something.
If you could propose to someone, you know, anywhere in the world, where would you do it?
Paris.
The Hall of Mirrors at Linderhof Palace in Germany, because if she agreed, I'd be surrounded by a thousand yeses.
Or Paris. Why?
Dr. Jacob is gonna propose to Michelle.
 Yeah.
 Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.
 Do you wanna talk about it?
 Yes, I do.
Diamond Dogs, mount up!
Never fucking mind.
What-- what's going on? What-- What's the Diamond Dogs?
It's a living fucking nightmare!
The Diamond Dogs are a group of men committed to supporting each other by sharing their most intimate thoughts, feelings and experiences. You in or out?
I'm in.
Goddamn it!
Roy chose "out." Yeah, I assumed.
Sorry, just--  I just came as fast as I could.
 Take your time.
 Hey, we appreciate your expediency.
 I got a bit light-headed.
Balance. Okay. I am okay.
First order of business: new member.
Coach, you have the floor.
Dr. Jacob and Michelle are getting engaged.
It's a hard moment when an ex moves on.
Did he at least ask your permission?
Well, I'm her ex-husband, not her current father.
So, no, he-- No.
How did you find out?
He took her to Paris.
Can you believe that?
That's it?
 Unbelievable.
 What?
Ted, I ran down the stairs for this and up some other stairs.
I'm gonna have leg cramps in my sleep tonight.
Okay, now, hold on a second, okay? This is happening, all right?
My man took Michelle to Paris on a surprise trip.
Why else would he do that?
Can I just talk whenever?
Well, he's right, Ted.
You can't worry about something that hasn't happened yet.
What he said. If anything, you should find out before you flip out.
"Find out before you flip out," huh?
Yeah, okay. No, that-- Yeah, you're right.
Of course. Thank you. Yeah. Hey.
All right. Anybody else got something?
Roy, you got anything you wanna talk about?
 Fuck you.
 Okay.
All right. Well, Diamond Dogs, disperse then.
Woof!
 Am I in trouble?
 No, nothing like that. No. Promise.
 I'm sorry I'm late.
 Oh, no, that's okay.
No, thank you for coming. Just take a seat. Thank you.
Just waiting on one more.
There you go.
 Are we in trouble?
 No. Nobody's in trouble. Just...
Well, you know, I just don't wanna say it until everyone's here, so...
I'll call. It's fine. I'll just call.
 <i>Hello, Coach Shelley.</i>  Hello, Ms. Kakes.
I just wondered if Rupert was on his way to my office for our special meeting.
<i>No, he's not coming to that.</i> I mean, he said that he would, so-- I mean, is he busy?
<i>No.</i> It's fine. Don't worry. I guess it's just us then.
For the very first meeting of the-- Drumroll, please.
Love Hounds.
I thought that we men could get together whenever we needed, every now and then, and just talk and help each other out with how things are going on in our personal lives.
Okay.
Well, I'd love to talk about the stresses of taking care of my aging parents.
Yeah, I'll start.
So I-- I've started seeing this girl, and it's going real well.
I really like her. She's great.
But she's hesitant to label our relationship, and I don't know whether to give her space or whether to let her know just how strongly I feel about us being together.
Disco, would you-- Do you got any thoughts or-- I've been divorced three times.
Never let them know how you feel. It's very expensive.
Okay.
I read this book that said, "If you like a woman, you should insult her." Okay, this meeting's over, and it'll probably never happen again.
Thank you for coming. Thank you both.
 Are we in trouble now?
 No, Roger. Just go. No. Thank you.
It's all right.
Hey, Boss.
Morning, Ted.
 Here you go.
 Morning. Thank you.
I could use your help.
Of course. Anything. Wait. Shouldn't you be at training?
Oh, yeah, but don't worry. I've got that all covered.
Go, go, go, go!
Right. Okay, then. Well, how can I help?
 I need to hire a private investigator.
 Why?
'Cause Dr. Jacob took Michelle to Paris, the French one, and I'm pretty sure he's gonna propose.
Now I gotta find out if I'm right so I don't flip out when I am.
Ted, people visit Paris for all kinds of reasons.
 Yeah, like getting engaged.
 No. They go to eat the amazing food--  After getting engaged.
 No.
Or they go to see Oscar Wilde's grave.
 Before they get engaged.
 No.
Or they visit the Louvre to make fun of all the people taking blurry pictures of an overrated painting.
Yeah. Where'd you and Rupert get engaged?
That doesn't matter.
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Right now, Dr. Romance is probably getting ready to pop the question on top of the Eiffel Tower, the most romantic frigging place in the world.
Oh, please. The Eiffel Tower is just a lamppost with a publicist.
Rebecca, come on. I just need to know what's going on with them.
Please help me.
Okay, Ted. I'll make the call.
 Okay. Thank you.
 Okay.
I didn't know Oscar Wilde was dead.
Some of his quotes feel so modern, so of our time.
I know. Powerful.
Okay.
Come in.
Is now a good time, Ms. Jones?
Yes, of course. Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Thank you, Barbara.
Jack asked me to give you this.
What is it?
It's a statement.
"Allow me to first offer my sincere apologies.
I deeply regret that video that some of you have seen online.
I'm beyond embarrassed, and I should have never made this video in the first place." "I hope you can forgive me while I learn and grow." Jack thought you could post it across your socials.
But maybe not Facebook, 'cause that's just for grandparents and racists now, isn't it?
Hey, Jamie? Jamie? Can I get some Lynx?
Yeah, sure, mate. What's your pit flavor? I've got Epic Fresh, Sport Recharge, Java, Africa, Ice Chill, Gold, Excite, Black, Dark Temptation and Leather and Cookies.
 Leather and Cookies, please.
 Smart choice for a smart boy.
 There you go.
 Lovely stuff.
'Ey. Have you smelled this?
Yo! Yo, y'all see this? A bunch of famous chicks got their nude photos leaked.
Oh, wow.
Hey, <i>The Sun</i> is calling it "The Great A-wank-ening." What is the opposite of clever?
<i>The Sun</i>.
Well, I guess I know what I'm doing this weekend.
Oi, fuck that.
 We shouldn't be looking at that shit.
 Why not?
Because it wasn't meant for us, Jan Maas. It was their private property.
Nah, bro. If you don't want your private pictures out there,  just don't take naked pictures.
 Yeah.
Especially being famous.
What? Come on, man.
 It's that simple.
 Fuck that, Cowburn. No, man.
The only people to blame are the dickheads who steal your shit and put it online.
That's why I delete all the photos on my phone.
I swear down. Especially 'cause I'm famous.
Hey, listen. I'm with Jamie on this one.
Whenever I have a relationship end, I ask the girl to go through my phone, delete any photos, videos. Whatever she wants.
 Bro, for real?
 Yeah. I'm being serious.
You know, one girl actually deleted Candy Crush.
I was devastated, but I also understood.
Hey, hold on. Once someone sends you a photo, don't you own it?
Copyright law on private photography is quite murky.
It's not about the law. It's about doing what is right. Like in <i>Les Misérables</i>.
Jean Valjean.
Fuck yeah, 24601.
No. 'Ey, deleting photos makes no sense.
What? Do we delete our memories too?
No, 'cause no one can steal your memories.
That's not entirely true.
 Yes.
 Nah.
What if I took the photo?
 You should delete it.
 What if it was a Christmas card?
Delete it, bro.
 What if it's artsy?
 What the fuck does that mean?
It's in black-and-white. You can't see anything.
Delete it, mate.
What if I'm in the photo?
 Delete it.
 I know. What about sonograms?
 Delete that shit.
 What if I'm French?
 Delete it.
 What if she's naked, but not sexual?
 What the fuck? What is she doing in it?
 She's just defecating.
Delete it, bro.
 What about a commissioned painting?
 Is it in a nice frame?
It's leaning against my couch.
Gotta burn it, bro.
No, I shouldn't have to delete my photos just because they might get stolen.
It's my stuff. Don't touch it.
I'm with that. That makes sense.
Hey, guys.
This article says Keeley was one of the women who was hacked.
Right. Everybody, take out your phones.
Delete every single picture and video that you've ever been sent. Now!
We're all targets for this shit. So delete everything.
But we're professional footballers. It could take days.
If not weeks.
Now!
Hey, man, take out your phone.
Colin. I wasn't playing. I told you to delete that shit.
I will, man. Fuck off.
 I said delete it right now.
 Hey! Hey.
Fuck off.
This whole thing is so fucking upsetting. I tried to watch the video this morning, and immediately, boom, I was right back to being 15 again, reliving that moment where this topless photo I took for Jimmy Daniels was being passed around at school.
Teenage boys can be awful.
Mr. Daniels was my teacher.
Well, men who act like teenage boys actually are awful.
I'm not an idiot.
I know there are tons of topless photos of me online. But those were my choice.
Absolutely. It makes a huge difference.
Yeah.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Restructure society so women aren't constantly sexualized while simultaneously being crucified for being sexual?
On it.
 Should I be ashamed or embarrassed?
 What?
I don't know.
How did Jack respond?
Yeah, she was really lovely.
And then I got this from her.
She didn't write this.
 You don't think so?
 No, it's caked in lawyer ick.
You don't wanna say that, do you?
No.
Then tell her that. Give her a chance to surprise you.
Thank you.
You know, there might be a silver lining in all this.
Just think of how many young women you are going to teach how to masturbate properly.
 What?
 I'm serious.
Back in the day, I didn't have a clue what I was doing.
And then one day I accidentally bumped into my parents' couch and it felt nice, so I stuck with it.
A year later, my mum had to have everything reupholstered.
I blamed the dog.
 Well, that was smart.
 Yeah, we didn't have a dog.
I love you.
I've got you.
Also, French sisters.
Spanish twins.
Mom and daughter in Mexico.
I'll miss you all. <i>Merci.</i>  Hi. Thank you, love. Bye.
 Hi. Yeah.
Oi, Keeley.
Hi.
Hey.
I heard about what happened. It's fucking shit.
Yeah, on so many levels.
I'm so sorry.
Thanks, Roy.
You okay?
All things considered, yeah. Yeah.
Good.
And you?
Me, yeah, I'm good.
Who was it for?
What?
The video. Who was it for?
Shit, I'm sorry, Keeley. I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Babe?
In here.
Hey.
How you doing?
Better. Worse. Everything.
I got your statement.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I called my dad for advice, and his lawyers got involved.
It's corporate fuckery at its finest.
Yet, you had Barbara give it to me.
Well, I tried to pick the most sensitive, empathetic person I knew.
Jack, I can't do it.
I get it.
I'm just so sorry you have to deal with all of this shit.
I'm sorry that you have to too.
How about, for the next few hours, we pretend none of this shit happened?
Should we invite Barbara over? Mess it all up?
Yeah, let's definitely do that.
I'll bet she's a party animal.
You actually have no idea.
 Really?
 Oh, yeah.
"Asim was right, Marcus thought.
They were failing, and worse than that, they were wasting time.
They were gonna wait another day before meeting?
That would only leave two days, and one of them was Saturday, when they wouldn't be at Breakfast Club.
What if he never got his football back from the creature? What if-- A large hand landed on Marcus's shoulder, and he spun around to find Mr. Anderson looking down at him.
'I heard you went under the fence,' he said." Oh, boy.
We're gonna stop there for the night. Cliff-hanger.
Hey, how was your flight out?
Good.
Yeah?
Do you know I have the most air miles of any kid in my school?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, that don't surprise me.
Things at school good though? You and Doug back on track and all that?
Yeah.
We're starting a band.
Starting a band? Really?
All right. What instrument are you gonna play?
Drums.
Okay. Well, your mom's gonna love that.
You know what? Now might be a good time to let you know that Dave Grohl learned to play drums on pillows.
We don't have to tell your mom that though right away.
Yeah, exactly.
Not as fun.
Getting all your homework done?
I have to, or I can't watch TV.
Of course. You know how it goes.
 Homework. Dinner. TV time.
 Homework. Dinner. TV time.
That's right.
Good system.
Does...
Does Dr. Jacob ever, you know, hang out around TV time with you?
Who is that?
No. Sorry. Jake. Mom's friend, Jake.
 Sometimes.
 Sometimes, yeah.
Yeah. That's all right.
Does he ever...
read to you, like, at night? Like, bedtime?
It's totally fine.
Nothing wrong with that, I think that's great.
It's good to have people in your life that are excited to be around you, you know?
Especially if, you know...
it's someone who makes your mom happy and all that.
Which he seems to do.
You guys get along all right?
Come on, man.
Good morning.
Holy shit.
I didn't wanna wake you, so I went out and did some cheeky retail therapy.
I loved it so much, I didn't want to take it off.
 What do you think?
 You look incredible.
I mean, nothing but the best for our dear Uncle Bernie, right?
Shit.
Babe, I canceled that.
I just-- After the whole thing, I thought you wouldn't want to be around a bunch of press and cameras.
I'm sorry. I should've asked.
 I thought I was doing the right thing.
 No. Don't apologize.
You're right. Thank you. I didn't think about that.
But you know what?
Leave it on, and I'll put on my own killer fucking outfit, and we can go do something stupid and fun and look amazing while doing it.
Yeah, okay.
No, actually, take it off.
Oh, my God.
 Keep the hat on, but...
 Jesus.
... everything else is definitely coming off.
Okay, bud.
Coach and I got the whole day off.
We're talking no game, no scouting, no nothing.
The world is our oyster.
Okay. Well, how about the world is our shrimp cocktail?
Okay, great.
All right, Coach. What are our options?
There is a immersive Jack the Ripper walking tour that Jane's been raving about.
It's, like, six hours long, and at one point, you get chased.
What are you nuts? I mean, he's a boy.
Fine, there's the London Eye. There's the Tower of London.
There's all the London stuff.
There's a rave in Peckham.
Okay, Coach, I appreciate it.
Hey, big guy, what do you wanna do? We could go to some museums.
We could rent a boat, float down the Thames.
They spell it weird, but it is lovely.
I wanna go see a football game.
Okay.
Let me see if I got this straight.
My one day off from football, you wanna go watch football?
It's a little bit like asking a mailman to go for a walk on his day off, don't you think?
Yeah, you don't care. You're just a little boy, ambivalent as all heck. Okay.
Coach, we got any games in town today?
There's one.
Well, there you go.
But I'm gonna have to stop at home first.
Look. There he is, there.
Hey, Nate!
Nate!
Nate!
Coach, look who came to watch.
Nate!
Must be looking for tips.
 He saw me, Dad. He saw me.
 Yeah, he did. He heard you too.
Holy shit.
Well, what can I say? I'm the daughter of a billionaire.
I learned to read a green before I learned to read a book.
Well, you might be a great golfer, but I happen to be a really great cheater.
So I think that makes us even.
Watch out!
Oh, my goodness, it's a tie.
 Uh-huh?
 Yes, look.
Isn't this way better than watching polo with a bunch of old white men?
Definitely.
And I reckon the dinosaurs here are much less handsy.
Oh, yeah, the dinosaurs are.
But I can't say the same for some other people.
 Oh, yeah?
 Yeah.
Jack?
Sorry. Excuse me.
Oh, my--  Hi.
 Look at you. Nice suit.
What are you doing here?
My sister's hen do.
 She's marrying a golfer.
 A professional?
Oh, no. He just golfs.
We have to do a shot every hole, but the good news is her friends suck.
Hello.
This is Alyssa. We went to uni together.
And this is my friend, Keeley Jones.
 Hi.
 Hi.
Keeley runs a PR firm.
You or your family ever need anyone, this is who you want.
That's me.
Cool.
Alyssa! Come on!
 Coming, Sis!
 Hurry up!
Come on.
Fucking families.
Anyway, it was nice to see you, Jack.
 Yeah, you too.
 Love the hat.
Thanks. Yeah.
All right, let's make things a little more interesting, shall we?
Ten pounds a hole, but I will spot you 20 strokes.
 You're on.
 But no cheating.
Then only a pound a hole.
Great match, Coach.
 Hello, my darlings.
 Hey, Mae.
- What have you three been up to today?
 We went to the West Ham game.
Then you don't drink in this pub.
 Hey, come on, Mae.
 He's a child.
 Hey!
 Mae!
Thank you.
You think I wanted to fucking be there?
You two are on probation.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Fair enough.
Bye, Mae.
 Dad.
 Yeah?
 Listen.
 What?
The Beatles.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, you know what? I'll be right back.
Hey, Boss, what do you got for me?
Right. Ted, listen, I want you to know, you do not have to go down this road.
<i>I know, but I need to, okay?</i> 'Cause right now, Michelle and this Dr. Jacob fella could be sitting there, having dinner at one of her favorite Parisian hotels, like the George Sank...
 Cinq.
 ... or the Plaza Anthony.
Athénée. Hold on.
Her favorite hotels in Paris? I thought you said she'd never been there.
Yeah, she hasn't. But the George Stank...
 Cinq.
 ... is from her favorite movie, <i>French Kiss</i>,  <i>and the Plaza Anthony--</i>  Athénée.
That's from her favorite TV show,  <i>Sex in the City.</i>  <i>Sex and the City.</i> <i>Wait, what's all that noise? Where are you?</i> Sounds like someone's singing.
Wh-- No, I'm sorry. I'm at a pub with Beard and Henry.
Why? Is it too loud? I can step away further if that helps.
No, it's fine.
Where were we?
You think I'm nuts.
Thanks, Michael.
So, you like The Beatles, huh?
Why is that?
'Cause my dad does.
You know what this song's about?
Someone named Jude.
Not just someone. A little boy named Jude.
And one day his mom and dad decided to break up. You know, get divorced.
And that made Jude real, real sad.
Now, Jude's dad had a best friend, and that best friend was real worried about Jude and all his sad feelings.
So he wrote him this song, hoping that, well, the words might help him somewhere down the road.
The long and winding road?
Hey, Henry.
You have a great mom and dad, and they love you tons, even though it's weird they live in different countries.
And I know right now it feels like you're in a sad song.
But you, young man, you have the power to take a sad song and make it better.
I like that.
Yeah, me too.
But you know what the best thing about this song is?
What?
This!
Enjoy yourself, laddie! Come on! Fucking sing it!
<i>You know, Ted, I'm so curious about something.</i> Why didn't you ever take Michelle to Paris yourself?
Well, I wanted to. I mean, you know, we were too broke to go on our honeymoon.
And then, well, we both got busy.
And then we had Henry, and I just-- I always thought we'd have more time.
Ted, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
But seriously, who gives a flying fuck if Michelle gets engaged?
That time in your relationship with her has passed, <i>but your time with Henry hasn't.</i> You need to stop letting yesterday get in the way of today, Ted.
Well, I don't think he's singing "Yesterday." Ted.
No, I know. I'm just joking.
 And you're right.
 Of course, I'm right. I'm always right.
Now, for the love of God, will you get back to that pub and sing "Hey Jude" with your boy?
Mercy buckets, Boss.
<i>De rien,</i> Coach Lasso.
Thank you.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
No, I agree. It's much better.
Thank you, George.
Okay, so, good news.
We've got a much more toned-down version of the statement.
The last one was so shit.
Great.
<i>I was once broken up with by a guy's doorman.</i> <i>I'm sorry, Ms. Hobbes, Jonathan won't be coming down. Ever.</i> Hey.
I know it's lame. But it will help, believe me.
Before, when you said that you were gonna take care of this, I thought that meant you were gonna get the video taken down  or something like that.
 We tried. It's the fucking Internet.
Making this statement is taking care of it now.
By having me make an apology?
Yes.
Please just do it.
Sorry, but it's not a great look when the person I'm seeing, whose company I fund, has a porno online.
A porno?
You know what I mean. We're just-- We're limiting the damage. Okay?
Jack, I'm not doing it.
This video being leaked is not my fault. But for some reason, you think it is.
Well, maybe, I don't know-- maybe you shouldn't have made the video in the first place.
It's certainly not something to be proud of, Keeley.
I don't regret making that video.
And I don't regret sending it.
Are there more out there?
I don't know.
 What are you doing?
 I think I should go.
Are you coming back?
I don't know.
Right.
Do you want to go out and celebrate?
Celebrate what?
 Didn't you win today?
 Oh, yeah. But...
No. That's okay though.
Already working on the next one, so...
You should enjoy your victories.
It looks like they did.
There it is.
What?
I love your smile.
I like to see my boyfriend happy.
Boyfriend.
Yeah.
If you're into labels.
Yeah. No, I'm into labels. Sure.
 Yeah?
 Yeah.
 "This is Jade. She's my girlfriend."  Yeah?
Sounds good, doesn't it?
"Nate. That's my boyfriend."  Nate's your boyfriend?
 Yeah. Have you met him? He's amazing.
Thank you very much.
Jamie.
 Hey.
 Hi.
So, I'm sorry just to drop in on you. I just--  I was nervous to text you. I--  Yeah.
I mean, like, you and everyone in my family.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
Well, I just-- I wanted to check in on you. See how you're doing.
It's just so fucking shit, all of this.
Thanks, Jamie.
Yeah, doing all right.
Yeah?
That's good.
And I also-- I just-- I wanted to apologize.
 No, you don't have to do that.
 No, I do. Oh, no, I do.
 I do.
 Jamie, this is not your fault.
No, it is my fault. And let me just-- I just need to tell you.
I deleted it off my phone way back when we broke up.
I deleted everything.
I mean, not straightaway, 'cause I did think that you and me was maybe gonna get back together again.
But then you started going out with Roy, and that's when I deleted most of it.
Well, like, half.
But that was mostly out of anger, to be honest.
Because, well, I think-- I thought the only reason that the two of you was going out was to make me jealous.
But...
Then I saw it was real, and then I got rid of it all.
I just forgot about the fucking emails.
It's so stupid. I should have been more careful.
I should have picked a stronger password or something.
Oh, no.
Don't tell me your password was "password," Jamie.
Yeah.
Well, to be fair, I did think I'd fool 'em 'cause I spelled it with two S's.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Keeley.
Really am.
Thank you, Jamie.
Excuse me, do you mind taking a photo of me at the box?
 Oh, yeah.
 Thanks.
 All right.
 No.
 It's like that. Yeah.
 All right.
 It's all right.
 Take a good one.
All right. Smile. There we go.
All right, big guy. Time to roll. Let's do it.
 Bonjour!
 In here!
Hi, kiddo.
Mom!
I missed you. Did you have fun with your dad?
Yeah. He's gonna buy me a drum kit.
 Is he really?
 W-- You know what? I love you, buddy.
I love you too, Dad.
All right, go on. Get outta here.
I don't know where he gets these ideas.
Hey, don't forget this thing.
What are you doing?
You-- Sorry, I was screwing around.
Okay.
How was Paris?
It was all right.
Yeah. Well, that's what it's known for. City of all rights.
Come on, Mom!
It was good seeing you.
Good seeing you too.
You know, Dave Grohl learned to play drums on pillows.
I'm coming!
There he is. Huh?
 
@@@@@@
You know, I didn't wanna say it at the time 'cause I'm trying to be less stuck in my fucking ways...
But?
But I thought it was nuts to change our entire philosophy and style of play mid-season.
But?
But it's fucking great.
You know, they're having fun, we're having fun, these folks are having fun. It's a whole bunch of fun.
I haven't seen 22 dudes have this good a time on grass since I saw the Grateful Dead jamming with the Black Crowes and Phish.
I bet that was a tight show.
It was a mess. But they had fun.
 Beautiful!
 Shoot!
Yeah!
Whistle! Whistle!
That's half. Great job.
You hear that? Roy said y'all did a great job.
Nice shot, mate.
Ay, Chihuahua.
I can't remember which pair is clean and which one is dirty.
You bundle your dirty socks?
Just because they're dirty doesn't mean they don't deserve to have a friend.
He's right. After all, we're all mates with Richard.
Hey, boyo.
Do you wanna get a beer or something later? Have a chat?
No.
Ay, no. I chose the dirty socks.
Oops.
So, have you heard from Jack yet?
You know how you're never ever supposed to write another text to an unanswered text?
Of course.
Oh, God. You sent a double text.
So much blue.
I know.
It's like I got diarrhea of the thumbs or something.
Come here.
Uh-oh.
When girl talk turns into girl hug, you know that either means something horrible's happened or absolutely nothing at all.
Jack's ghosting Keeley.
Oh, no.
First, she wants to go on a break, and now the old digital Irish goodbye.
Which is a term I never really understood.
'Cause I got a buddy back home named Seamus O'Malley, and that son of a gun hugs folks goodbye for, like, 20 minutes before he leaves anywhere.
Yeah, sorry to hear about that.
Hey, I did make you some biscuits, you know, just to soften the blow.
Thanks, Ted.
Thank you.
What? There's like 40 quid in here.
I didn't know you were gonna be here till this morning.
No time to do anything special, so I just tossed a little cash in there.
That is very sweet. Thank you, Ted.
Ain't nothing to it but to do it.
Hey, boss. You mind if I skip the press conference today?
Michelle and I got these parent-teacher meetings I don't wanna miss.
Of course, Ted. Family first.
I appreciate it.
We could have Roy do it.
I know he hates that stuff, but he is really good at it.
I mean, you know, fine by me.
Great idea.
Look at you. Heartbroken, but still kicking butt.
I mean, I'm not heartbroken. It's more like heart-bent.
Heart-bent. I like that.
It's a great title for a country song. You know, like...
<i>I'm heart-bent in my apartment</i> <i>'Cause all that you left Was your fart scent</i> All right. Goodbye, Ted.
<i>And now that you're gone</i> <i>I wrote this song 'Cause all you left was</i> <i>The smell of your farts</i> - Coach Kent.
 Hey.
Speak of the devil.
Okay.
 Keeley.
 Roy.
So I need you to fill in for Ted at today's press conference, if that's okay.
Fuck no.
I mean, why can't Ted do it?
I mean, I'd love to.
Wonderful.
Shall we?
Fuck.
I heard that.
Delivery for Mr. Shelby.
It's Shelley.
Oh, my-- I'm so sorry.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I brought you lunch. Figured we'd have it here.
I'm surprised Derek gave you the time off.
He said it was fine.
As long as I brought him back something with a West Ham logo on it.
Well, I can do that.
How about-- There you go. Mouse pad.
And he can have a scarf.
So sorry. There you go.
The-- And there. That's the official pro-- And actually, you know-- Just don't have that.
I only need one.
Well, you know, just keep them for next time.
Oh, dang.
You got to his afternoon kiss before I did.
Rupert, hello.
Okay. So, Jade, this is Rupert, my boss.
And, Rupert, this is Jade, my girlfriend.
Well, hello there.
 Hello.
 It's worthwhile to meet you.
Jade. What a beautiful name.
Thank you. It's actually short for Jaded.
My mother named me after her favorite aunt.
But I don't care.
Hold on. I like to consider myself a bit of a-- an amateur dialectologist.
You are from the south of Poland, right?
Yes, I'm from Nowy Sącz.
Would you look at that smile.
Yeah, Jade, if this young man wasn't so brilliant, I'd say that you are out of his league.
What's that smell?
Jade surprised me with lunch.
It's from the Taste of Athens. It's my favorite place.
I'm a hostess there.
Which is why it's his favorite place, I would say.
Yeah.
Well, wonderful to meet you, Jade.
And, Nate, mate, don't screw this up.
No.
Bye, Rupert.
He seems very wealthy. But also nice-like.
Yeah, no, he is. He's actually really decent.
I owe him a lot. So-- Right.
It's so kind of you doing this, you know.
Pardon the interruption, Rebecca.
Did you know that Ted wasn't doing his press conference today?
Yes. I asked Roy to fill in.
That explains it.
Is there a problem?
That is not what I said, Gary!
I have your quote right here!
You did say it, Coach.
 Stay out of this, Lloyd!
 Don't shout at Lloyd.
You said, and I quote, "Joe Walsh is a better guitarist than Jimmy Page." That's what you said.
Fine! I said it!
But what I meant was that Joe Walsh, underrated.
Jimmy Page, overrated!
I mean, Joe Walsh is a poet.
Jimmy Page is a fucking court stenographer on Adderall.
Are you out of your mind? Page could beat Walsh with one string.
What do you mean beat him? It's not a competition, man!
It's art, you fucking Neanderthal!
 Okay.
 Hello!
 Okay. I think this is over. Yeah.
 You're suspect!
 Me?
 Yeah, you!
Hello! I-- "Stairway to Heaven" is a glorified fingering exercise, and you all know it!
So much passion.
I can't think of the last time I was able to be here with all you absolutely...
just brilliant members of the press down here in the pressroom.
So with that in mind, I would love to take some questions.
Come on, absolutely ask me anything.
 Yes.
 Marcus Adebayo, <i>The Independent</i>.
 Hello there, Marcus. How are you?
 Very well.
 Good. Yes?
 Miss Welton, in your opinion, who's the greatest classic rock guitarist of all time?
Great question.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Sorry about that.
 "The guy from Cream."  Yes, all right!
Don't start with me, Leslie! I panicked.
I'm gonna murder Roy Kent.
Look, Roy not doing press is just Roy being Roy.
Oh, yes. Well, I am sick of Roy being Roy.
So, it's time for Rebecca to be Rebecca.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. I couldn't-- Yeah. There you go.
Yes!
No, you get back down there.
Why? I already did my 20, easily.
Yeah. We don't start counting until it hurts.
And that goes for all of you!
Oi! Kent!
Get your hairy arse into my office. Now!
Every single one of you knows my arse isn't hairy.
Yet none of you spoke up.
And I will never forgive you.
He's right. We're cowards.
Now, if she was talking about Richard's butt...
So, are folks still dissecting frogs in science class these days or is it all just talking about the frog's feelings now?
<i>Honestly? Both.</i> <i>Ms. Ledbetter, is there anything Henry can be doing</i> <i>to bring up his grade in your class?</i> Coach, can I-- Yeah, besides helium.
Isaac knows.
That Ted's son is failing science?
Scandal.
 How did he react?
 Not good.
He won't talk to me.
Give him a minute.
You shouldn't have to, but some people need it.
Don't forget, you've known you were gay for 20 years.
Much longer than that.
Once I was out of my mum, I never looked back.
But I hear you. Thanks, Trent.
Yeah. Hey, but you know what my favorite thing was about Sir Isaac Newton?
He was so down to Earth.
<i>Ted, we need to let her go.</i> Yeah, we better go let Ledbetter go.
What the fuck is your problem?
Wait, I know this one. You are!
If I ask you to do a press conference, do the fucking press conference.
Okay. Shit. I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was a big deal.
So you just didn't do it?
Is that the plan for the rest of your life?
You're just gonna walk away from everything the second it isn't fun or easy?
What do you want, Roy?
What do you really want?
I just want to be left alone.
Oh, bullshit, Roy! You want way more than that!
You're just so convinced that you don't deserve anything good in your life, that you'd rather eat a bowl of shit soup and then complain about the portions.
Get out of your own way, man.
'Cause this whole "woe is me" thing you've got going on is just fucking ponderous.
Is that all?
Yeah, that's it.
For now.
How we looking for tomorrow?
Yeah. Great.
Think we should play without a goalie. You know, just to give 'em a chance.
I love it when you're cocky.
Baklava.
Oh, yeah. Help y--  Yeah.
 So lovely to meet Kate.
Jade. It's Jade.
Oh, yes. Of course. Jade. Yeah.
Well, she really enjoyed meeting you.
Nothing better than the love of a woman.
Sitting up there but it's just a little bit-- We'll get a drink.
Yo. Knock 'em dead, killer.
Well, I hope their kit man remembered to bring 11 body bags.
Hey, after the match, let's go for a drink. If you're up for it.
Yeah, that'd be great. Shall I invite Jade?
No, I was thinking it was just the two of us. You know, a guys' night.
Oh, yeah. That'd be lovely. I mean, cool.
Right, let's go blow some bubbles.
<i>Across town, West Ham are hoping to stay top of the table</i> <i>against Southampton.</i> While here at Nelson Road, the red-hot Greyhounds face Brighton.
Color red tops off at about 800 centigrade, Arlo.
The way Richmond are playing, a more accurate description would be yellow-hot.
<i>Thank you for correcting me, Chris,</i> <i>and next time feel free to wait until we're off air.</i> What's this?
We're so full we ran out of pint glasses.
Bottoms up.
<i>Bringing in the money</i> That tastes better.
<i>The denizens of the Dogtrack have seen</i> <i>their Greyhounds race up the table of late.</i> <i>The air is filled with an unfamiliar confidence</i> <i>of another trip to the winners' circle.</i>  Leslie, did you just text me?
 I did.
 I'm sitting right here.
 I see that now.
It's Jack.
She's saying that she's in Argentina...
for the next couple of months.
Ouch.
Well, I think our break is actually an "up." So now that Jack is officially my ex, please feel free to say any of the things that you didn't like about her.
Well-- Her handshake was way too firm.
You know-- I get it. You're friendly.
Good riddance.
All right, yo. Let's do this, man.
Go get 'em, Captain.
Isaac.
All right, fellas, here we go. Focus up, y'all.
Coach, who we got today?
Brighton and Hove Albion.
Brighton, Hove and Albion. I didn't know we were playing a law firm.
Okay, let's bring it in. Here we go!
Go ahead, Captain. Count us off.
Richmond on C. A, B, C!
Richmond!
<i>Brighton have something going here, until that heavy touch by Cooke.</i> <i>Oh, no!</i> <i>A thoughtless poke by McAdoo</i> <i>and a Richmond goal kick becomes a Brighton corner.</i> <i>McAdoo lost concentration there.</i> <i>An uncharacteristic mistake from the captain.</i> Well done, McAdoo, you fucking numpty!
<i>Some of the Richmond fans letting McAdoo have a piece of their minds.</i> <i>The corner comes in.</i> <i>And the keeper collects.</i> Yes, Zoreaux. Yes, good take, man.
It's actually Van Damme.
<i>Van Damme's been a commanding presence, Chris.</i> <i>Just like in the movie</i> Timecop<i>, where he does the splits twice.</i> Richmond with possession.
<i>Hughes has the ball. He's looking for space.</i> <i>It's not there. He passes back to Maas.</i> <i>No! Cooke steps in, and Brighton are off.</i>  <i>And just like that...</i>  Fuck!
 <i>... Joey Miller puts Brighton up 1-nil.</i>  Shoot.
Oh, for fuck's sake! Fucking hell!
<i>Is this the beginning of the end of Richmond's hot streak?</i>  What the fuck, bruv?
 What?
 Their fucking goal's over there.
 Oh, right, yeah.
Fucking fix up. Don't fucking walk away from me.
 Relax.
 Their fucking goal's over there.
<i>McAdoo is furious,</i>  <i>remonstrating with Hughes for his error.</i>  Wait? What?
 Don't fucking walk away from me!
 <i>Obisanya defuses the situation,</i>  <i>but McAdoo remains incandescent.</i>  Fuck!
 We have time. Come on!
 <i>My word.</i> <i>Richmond asking plenty of questions in the first half</i> <i>but haven't been able to put anything into Brighton's net.</i> <i>As we enter one minute of stoppage time,</i> the Seagulls would be thrilled to go into the locker room leading by a goal to nil.
<i>Any thoughts, Chris?</i> <i>Seagulls are wretched creatures</i> <i>who'll steal your car keys right off your beach towel.</i> <i>Richmond's starting to click.</i> <i>This is the crisp ball movement we've come to expect from them.</i> <i>This is slick. One-touch passing around the area.</i> <i>Rojas is in.</i> <i>Smothered by Brighton.</i> <i>And that's the half.</i> <i>Brighton's up 1-nil, but it's still anyone's game.</i> Same old Richmond. Still a shit show.
You're absolutely rubbish!
Stop passing the ball around and bloody do something!
You're a disgrace to the badge!
You're all playing like a bunch of fucking fa--  What the fuck did you say to me?
 What?
What did you fucking say to me?
<i>Isaac McAdoo has jumped the wall and charged into the seats.</i> <i>This is unbelievable.</i> Oh, my God.
 I dare you to fucking say it again!
 <i>He appears to be</i> <i>in a confrontation with one of the Richmond supporters.</i> Thataway, McAdoo. Get him.
Hang on. He's one of ours.
Say that word again!
You leave it!
 Say that fucking word again!
 Isaac!
Number five!
Fuck's sake.
The captain, man.
<i>It's an obvious red card. McAdoo clearly has to go.</i> <i>Roy Kent as the voice of reason. What a world.</i> Fuck's sakes.
Good lad. Oi!
Get him the fuck out of here!
What?
<i>After all hell broke loose, halftime finally gets underway,</i> <i>and the Greyhounds have much to discuss.</i> All right, no one's gonna say nothing? Sure, no, I'll kick it off.
Isaac, what the hell happened?
One of our fans said some ignorant shit!
Okay, what'd they say?
 I heard it.
 Okay.
He said the f-word.
 Fuck?
 No, the other f-word.
Oh, fuck.
If it helps, the fan has been removed.
And I apologize for my dad.
Sorry, not the time for jokes.
Read the room, Leslie.
Okay, I get it. I...
Isaac, look. What that guy said? Inexcusable. All right?
But, man, your reaction to it ain't gonna be taught in any Tibetan monasteries anytime soon.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, now we're one man down.
Yeah, Isaac, come on, man. It's nothing we haven't heard before.
Exactly. It's just poopy. Ignore it, man.
Ignore it?
I don't want to fucking ignore it.
What if one of us is gay?
We shouldn't have to deal with this shit!
All right.
 I got it.
 Yeah.
You think I should have it?
No, get out, Roy. I don't need you to come in here.
Just leave me alone. Just fuck off, yeah?
I fucked it up. Just fucking fuck off. Just leave me alone.
I don't need you to start yelling at me.
I'm not here to yell at you.
What the fuck was that all about?
I don't know.
Colin, do you know?
Guys, it's pretty obvious.
Isaac's gay, right?
Well, statistically speaking, 10% of the population is homosexual.
So it's not that surprising.
So there are probably more people in this room who are gay.
I'm flattered.
Guys, we don't need to discuss this any further, okay?
All Isaac needs now is our support.
Yeah. That's our captain.
All right, fellas, let's focus on the second half.
 Now, what we got--  Hold on.
Isaac's not gay.
I don't know what happened out there, but I do know whatever it was isn't what you're really angry about.
Is it?
So then trust me.
You got to go deal with that...
or you're gonna fuck up whatever it is you actually do care about.
He's right, you know.
The little things we get mad about are like snowflakes on a mountain.
And if we wait too long, then we're just one sneeze away from an avalanche that will kill us all.
Thank you, Will.
 You want some bubble gum?
 Don't push it.
So, we cool?
Of course.
 Yeah.
 Of course. It's cool.
 Yeah. Yes, <i>amigo</i>.
 A thousand percent.
You're gay, big whoop. But we don't care. Right, guys?
 Yeah.
 All good, bro.
Now, hold on, actually.
Colin, we do care, you know.
When I was growing up back in Kansas City, I had a buddy named Stevey Jewell.
Now, he was a huge Denver Broncos fan.
But we were all growing up smack dab in the middle of Chiefs country.
So he used to catch a lot of guff for it, you know?
But me? Me, I told him it didn't affect the way I felt about him at all, you know?
I told him that I "didn't care." And I didn't, you know.
But then in 19s-- what, '97, '98, he had to watch back-to-back Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos in 'em all by himself.
First one, he ate an entire seven-layer dip from Price Chopper all by himself.
Big ol' thing. And it just wrecked his stomach.
Apparently, he destroyed the toilet in his parents' basement.
I remember the rumor at the time being that he caused $9,000 worth of damage.
Could you imagine? To a toilet. 9,000 bucks.
The next year, he did the exact same thing.
All by himself.
He must have thought it was good luck or something. I don't know.
'Cause I wasn't there. 'Cause I "didn't care." But I should've cared. You know?
I should've supported him.
I should've been at his house both them years.
Sharing that seven-layer dip with my friend while his garbage-ass team wins back-to-back Super Bowls.
Coach, did you just compare being gay to being a Denver Broncos fan?
You know what? I did, and I regret it. Yeah. Sorry about that.
What the fuck are Denver Broncos?
 No, that's a very good question.
 Oh, for fuck's sake.
It's an American football reference, an absolute fumble in this situation.
I apologize. Yeah. Okay.
But the point is, Colin...
we don't not care.
We care very much.
We care about who you are and what you must've been going through.
Yeah?
But hey, from now on, you don't have to go through it all by yourself.
All right?
Yeah. You hear that? You got us, mate. We got you.
Okay, well, look. Hey. I hate to bring up work in a moment like this, but we do have a second half of a match to play.
Coach, what we got?
Playing a man down. What do we do differently?
Absolutely nothing!
Let's go, baby.
Let's go.
Okay, all right. Captain, count us off.
Wow. That's me, yes. Okay.
I don't know what to say.
I'm honored to be your captain.
And, you know, I love you guys so very much.
On three. One, two, three.
I love you guys so very much!
Better or worse than you imagined?
Second-best way it could've gone, I think.
Best way being the entire team confesses that they're gay too, and we get to be on the cover of Oprah's magazine.
Cracking match, Coach.
Yeah. Thank you, Roger.
Hey, a few of us are getting a pint. Care to join us?
Sounds good but I'm actually going for a drink with Rupert tonight.
Just the two of us, so...
Are you in trouble?
Wh-- No. It's just like guys' night, so...
Cool. Maybe next time?
Yeah.
 Yes!
 Yes!
 <i>And Richmond have done it.</i>  Yes!
 How about that?
 Well done, sir.
<i>They complete the comeback for a thrilling two-one win...</i>  I love you so much, man.
 <i>... behind an inspirational turn</i> <i>from Colin Hughes.</i>  Come on!
 <i>Assisting both goals...</i> Yeah!
<i>... in a man-of-the-match performance.</i> <i>Wow, Hughes was sensational, Arlo.</i>  <i>After being benched earlier this season...</i>  AFC Richmond!
 <i>... back in the starting lineup,</i> <i>and today, the Welshman played like a man reborn.</i> A goal down, a man down, the Greyhounds scored twice in the second half.
Both assisted by an inspired Colin Hughes.
But the real fireworks were at halftime when Richmond's captain, Isaac McAdoo, went into the stands to attack one of their own fans.
In fairness, I wanted to do that a few times myself, Jeff.
Yeah, but you didn't, Clinton, 'cause you're not a psychopath like McAdoo.
- Now, George, you don't know what--  Oh, no-- Jeff. Jeff, come on.
You do not go into the stands. I don't care what was said.
That is a line you do not cross.
And that's why McAdoo wasn't captain when I was there.
'Cause he's not fit for it.
I mean, come on. He makes Roy Kent look like Bambi.
He's an idiot, isn't he? Come on.
 <i>McAdoo doing that.</i>  <i>Yes.</i>  <i>What was he thinking?</i>  <i>He's in big trouble.</i> Guy probably deserved it though, right?
 Absolutely.
 No doubt.
I hope his kids shiv him in his sleep.
What? He used to come in here.
He was a dick to my niece, Claire, once.
 No way.
 Not Claire.
Fucking prick!
<i>Moving over to east London,</i> <i>the Wonder Kid's West Ham took care of business at home.</i> And then he came in after me.
Hey, Rupert.
 You all right?
 Hey, Nathan.
Let me introduce Kelsie and Libby.
No. The other way around.
The other way.
Well, I'm still Rupert.
And this is Nathan Shelley, the Wonder Kid.
Hey, you all right?
 Hi.
 Hey.
So, the girls will be joining us tonight.
Shall we?
Yum, yum, yum.
Thought it was a guys' night, Rupert.
Well, yes. Trust me, it is.
Oscar. We're off to the private room.
Couple of bottles of champagne, please.
Actually, Rupert.
I'm so sorry, I need to leave.
Long story. I wanted to come and tell you in person.
Congratulations, Ted. That's eight wins in a row.
Come on now, Trent.
You know I don't care about winning or losing.
No, the truth is, only way I could be happier is if my arm-feet were covered in barbecue sauce.
How you feeling about the win streak, Roy?
No way. Do not come near me with that shit.
You never talk about a streak.
My grandparents were happily married for 51 years 'cause they never said a fucking word to each other. Scram.
Well done, gentlemen. Congrats.
Another one.
Oh, boy. Higgins hitting us with his DJ Khaled impression. Nice.
Who?
 Parallel thinking.
 Apparently so.
The press is ready for you, Ted. It's a big one.
That's what that lady from the American <i>Office</i> said.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Okay.
 He's on his way.
 Thank you, Leslie.
You gave Ted some talking points?
No. I haven't done that in a long time.
Oh, God.
Yeah. All right. You got me today.
Any questions?
Fucking hell.
You. Five-o'clock-shadow head.
Coach Kent, do you or the organization condone what Isaac McAdoo did today?
What a stupid fucking question.
Course we don't.
What Isaac did was awful. He was lucky he only got a red card.
Okay. So why'd he do it?
When I was first coming up through Sunderland, there was an old-timer on the team. Local guy.
He and his wife were about to have their first kid, so during training one day, I made a joke that, statistically, I was probably the real dad.
And the boys fell about laughing, but he went fucking nuts.
He battered me. Properly.
I had a black eye, chipped tooth, three broken ribs.
I couldn't play for six games.
He got booted off the team.
After that, no club would go near him.
Then in the summer, after I could breathe again, I bumped into him in a pub.
And I got the chance to say sorry for my stupid fucking joke.
And he got to tell me...
he and his wife had lost the baby...
a month before all that went down.
He hadn't told anyone. Kept it all inside.
Look, I get that some people think if they buy a ticket, they've got the right to yell whatever abusive shit they want at footballers.
But they're not just footballers. They're also people.
And none of us know what is going on in each other's lives.
So for Isaac to do what he did today, even though it was wrong...
I give him love.
And as for why he did what he did...
that's none of my fucking business.
Next question.
Yeah, New Trent.
Coach, let's talk about Colin Hughes.
Yeah, he's a hell of a player and a great man.
I think we've underused him.
 I think you're right.
 Glad we agree.
I prefer you to Old Trent.
Next question.
You. Goblin King, go.
Hey.
Hey.
What happened to guys' night?
Hey.
You lied to me.
For years.
What is it about me that made you think you couldn't tell me?
No, it was nothing to do with you.
It was about me.
I was 99% sure that you'd support me.
But the 1% chance that you wouldn't scared the shit out of me.
I don't know how you did it. I can't keep a secret for shit.
I know. Another reason I didn't tell you.
I mean, I hid it from people for years, and the second you find out, I didn't last a month.
I'm sorry, bruv.
You gonna tell everyone now?
No.
The team knows. And that's enough for me.
And no one's gonna say shit.
I promise.
Wanna come in?
Yeah, all right.
Come on.
Is "top or bottom" sex positions or sleeping arrangements?
Sexual positions.
Unless bunk beds are involved. Then it's both.
Would you ever shag a woman?
No, I'm gay.
I know, but what if you had to?
 1967 Raquel Welch.
 My man.
 Who's the fittest guy on the team?
 I won't tell you, and you'd never guess.
 Bumbercatch.
 Yes.
What about team showers? How does that work?
I keep my head down, and I think of global warming.
Yeah, well, if I had to shower with a bunch of girls all the time, I'd defo get boners.
I love you, boyo.
You can't say it, can you?
No.
But you know I do, yeah?
 
@@@@@@
<i>Jeff, we just got this in. Do we have time to run this?</i>  <i>Stand by, camera one.</i>  <i>In four, three, two...</i> <i>- Yeah, got it.</i>  <i>All right, let's go then.</i> {\an8}Hello, and welcome to <i>Soccer Saturday.</i> {\an8}I'm Jeff Stelling, here with George Cartrick and Clinton Morrison.
{\an8}Now, the hottest team in the country is clearly Richmond {\an8}on a ten-game winning streak on the back of some inspired play by Sam Obisanya.
{\an8}Jeff, you have to think Sam Obisanya will make his Nigeria debut, {\an8}or the world's gone truly mad.
{\an8}But our top story: {\an8}the mysterious managerial vacancy at West Ham United.
{\an8}The club has suddenly parted ways with the Wonder Kid, Nathan Shelley.
{\an8}It's a shocker, Jeff. They were having a great season.
{\an8}Yeah, but look, Nate Shelley isn't the reason West Ham are in second place.
{\an8}I mean, "Wonder Kid"? Come on.
{\an8}He was my kit man, for God's sake.
{\an8}No, Rupert Mannion is the brains behind this whole operation.
{\an8}Okay. Let's turn our attention to the international break.
{\an8}National squad announcements are trickling in.
{\an8}Which players will get the honor of representing their country?
All right, fellas, great play out there today.
Congratulations on yet another victorious outcome!
That's right.
Hey, quick reminder.
Because of the break in our schedule due to international play, there is no game next week, all right?
All right. Hey, look, kind of hurts my feelings y'all don't want to spend next weekend with me, if I'm being honest.
But I am the strong silent type, so I ain't gonna let you know.
But I'm also loud and weak, because I, like all humans, contain multitudes. Am I right?
Great speech.
Anyhoo, we want to say good night and good luck to the fellas on our squad that have been chosen to represent their home country next week.
Coach, who we talking about?
Just up the way at Wembley, making his debut for England, Jamie Tartt!
Go!
Taking the plane to Toronto to play goal for Canada, Van Damme!
He's got a plane ticket.
Who will be going up against Mexico and Dani Rojas!
Oh, boy.
Bumbercatch holding it down for Switzerland.
My guy!
 Wait, hold on. Bumbercatch, you're Swiss?
 Yeah. Look at me.
No, you're right. Yeah. All right.
 And repping Wales, Colin Hughes!
 Hey, there he is.
Let's go, boyo.
Is that it?
And that's it.
Okay. All right, well, let's go ahead and wish our friends safe travels and Godspeed, or whatever narcotic your deity chooses to self-medicate with.
Rest of y'all, see ya on Monday.
Oi, 24.
They fucked you, man. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Hey, congrats to you though.
Listen. You good, yeah?
Yeah. Of course.
Hey, yo. Congrats, bro.
I am not your bro.
We are now enemies, and soon, you will be my bitch.
What the f-- So you're telling me it only shows up once a month?
 And it never skips a month?
 Only if you're pregnant.
{\an8}Well, shoot. I got to check out this wine delivery service.
{\an8}Sounds like a real corker. Yes.
Did you hear about Nathan?
 I did.
 What do we think happened there?
{\an8}Well, boss, I'm like an incomplete list of Madeline Kahn's best films: I ain't got no clue.
And it ain't really none of my business anyhow.
Ted, look, I mean this in the nicest way possible, but you suck at girl talk.
I know. I just don't like gossip.
{\an8}It's not gossip, Ted. It's speculation.
I've actually been hearing rumblings of inappropriate workplace behavior  over at West Ham.
 See? Excellent girl talk.
{\an8}So, chaps, what do we think?
{\an8}Is Nathan capable of being involved in something like that?
 No.
 Nah.
{\an8}- Good morning.
 Hello, Leslie.
{\an8}So, I heard some interesting scuttlebutt last night.
{\an8}I don't like gossip, but my butt don't mind a little scuttle.
Go on, Leslie.
Edwin Akufo's back in town.
What now?
Apparently, he's sniffing around about trying to create a Super League of some sort.
Where did you hear this?
Well, Rebecca, I am the director of Football Operations.
And a bunch of us DFOs have a little jazz jam band we call "The Directors of Beboperations." {\an8}Akufo came up at rehearsal.
{\an8}This is not good.
{\an8}I'm sorry. Why is it so bad that a billionaire wants to put together {\an8}a bunch of superheroes to fight crime?
{\an8}Ted, you're thinking of the Justice League.
{\an8}God, dang it. Yeah, I am.
{\an8}Super League is when the world's biggest and wealthiest teams {\an8}decide to compete against each other.
{\an8}So, not only would David never get to face Goliath, {\an8}the Davids could cease to exist altogether.
{\an8}Wow.
{\an8}You know, I wouldn't be surprised if Rupert was involved in this.
{\an8}Speak of the devil.
 It was Rupert.
 Yes.
Sorry. Okay. I thought it was the actual devil for a second.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
Are you alive?
{\an8}Unfortunately, yeah.
You're okay.
Am I an idiot?
Sometimes, yes.
No, I meant for quitting my job.
Do you wish you hadn't?
Then there's your answer.
{\an8}I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
Do you need me to stay?
{\an8}No. No, that's-- No, I'm okay.
Do you want to come to Poland with me?
You can help me and my family screw in light bulbs.
 That's very funny.
 Why is it funny?
I don't know. Sorry. I-- No.
 I'll see you in a few days.
 Thank you.
Can you tell us about Coach Shelley?
Hey, Nate! Nate!
 Hi.
 Sorry.
 It's all right.
 Thanks.
Shit.
Keeley, you are the nicest boss I've ever had.
Thank you, Dan.
And definitely the hottest.
That's a complicated compliment.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Barbara, what's going on? Are we being slowly robbed?
Wait. I'm sorry. You haven't spoken with Jack?
I haven't heard from Jack in weeks.
But she emailed me last night to say that she was gonna reach out and tell you.
Tell me what, Barbara?
The board of the VC have decided to pull funding.
They're shutting down KJPR.
What?
When?
Oh, well, don't worry, we've got plenty of time.
 We don't have to be out till Friday.
 It's Wednesday.
Yeah. I suppose that is quite soon, isn't it?
Especially if you didn't get the email last night.
I mean, if he doesn't want to coach West Ham for millions, I'll bloody do it.
What a wanker.
Pineapple juice or apple juice?
Hi.
Hey, Dani!
Dani, what's up, man?
He's my teammate.
Dani, you want some chips?
Boy, oh, boy.
Tell you what, Sam had himself a case of the mean reds out there today, yeah?
I don't fucking blame him.
It's hard to see the ball when your eyes are full of tears.
Hey, Sam!
Hey, look, I know this week ain't been easy on ya.
But don't forget, even the great Michael Jordan himself didn't make his high school varsity basketball team.
 Yeah?
 Yes, Coach.
But wasn't that because he was only a 5'10" sophomore and the team was in need of height, so they sent him to the junior varsity with the hope that he would develop physically?
Which he did, growing 5 inches the very next summer.
I mean, if you know all the details, it does render the story a little less motivational, but my point still stands.
Keep your head up. Be a goldfish.
 All right?
 Okay.
Boom!
Tonight, me and Jane have reserved an axe-throwing lane at Hatchet and Rye.
You fellas care to join the festivities?
That sounds equal parts fun and dangerous. What are y'all celebrating?
Karma's speedy delivery of a shit sandwich to the Wonder Turd.
Here, Jane made targets.
Don't you feel it's bad karma to celebrate someone else's bad karma?
No. You in?
I'd love to, but I've got a thing.
Here we go.
Hey, Janey baby!
Yeah, we're all set. Could you remember to bring my throwing axe, please?
No, not that one. The one with the leather sleeve.
You know what? Just bring 'em all.
Yeah, we are.
Okay. Love you too.
How many axes you got now?
Seventeen. But they're not all for throwing.
Right. But they're all here in the UK?
Oh, yeah. Couldn't imagine being in a different country than my axes.
She's gonna have trouble carrying that.
 Hey, Sam.
 Hey.
I'm so sorry about the national team.
Well, you know. I guess I could have worked harder.
Well, I think you're wonderful.
Thank you, Rebecca.
 See you.
 Yeah.
Hello, Rebecca.
Where's the Hockney I gave you?
Got rid of it. Sorry. W-- How did you get past security?
My old mate, Renee.
The creepy old man that lives in the sewers?
Oh, Rebecca, that's rude.
He only works in the sewer.
Right. Well, maybe next time you could make an appointment.
Of course.
So, what do you want?
To invite you to this meeting for the Akufo League.
Why?
I've wanted to extend an olive branch.
And I think it's important that you're part of this.
Could be great for the game.
Well, I will give it some thought.
Good.
Sneaking in here today reminded me of the first match I ever saw at Nelson Road.
When they used to play by candlelight.
I look forward to hearing from you.
What happened with Nathan Shelley?
Some people just aren't ready when they get their shot.
Happy Uncle Day!
 You know it's not a real holiday, right?
 Yes, it is.
Right, Mummy?
Any day that annoys Roy, holiday for me.
I'll get it.
Phoe told me that Uncle's Day is her favorite holiday of the year.
 Fuck off.
 Yeah, seriously.
It was Uncle's Day, Uncle Roy's birthday, and then <i>Perchtenlaufen</i>, the German holiday where people dress up as evil spirits and roam the streets in order to scare winter away.
She might be an old soul, but she's a proper fucking dweeb, isn't she?
Is that your Range Rover outside?
 No, it's my mum's.
 Oh, right, all right.
Hey, how you doing? You all right?
 Sorry I'm late.
 It's okay.
You can just sit down next to Uncle Roy.
Hello, Uncle Roy.
What the fuck is he doing here?
I had to invite your best friend.
 He's not my best friend.
 He isn't my best friend.
Well, you talk about him a lot, and you spend every day together.
Well, he's not.
So, who's your best friend, Jamie?
Probably Isaac.
 Fuck off.
 He is.
 That's a pound, Uncle Roy.
 Bill me.
Okay. Now, open Jamie's gift.
It's stupid. It's dumb. I don't know.
Here.
It's your original England kit from the 2014 World Cup.
Your name's on the back there.
I got 'em to change the E to a U.
I love it.
Yeah. You owe me a pound, Jamie.
But I didn't say nothing.
No, but you made me think it, and that's basically the same thing.
Yeah, fair play.
Okay, my turn.
All right.
Who's that?
Good wrapping, that.
I made it at school.
The colors spell your name. Red, orange, yellow. Roy.
She's been very excited to give it to you.
What do you think?
Well, I mean, I fucking love it.
It was worth it.
Thank you.
Okay. Mum and I are going to put our costumes on for the performance.
Heads-up, team. There is an intermission.
 Your sister is fit.
 I will cut your eyes out.
Simi, what's going on? I thought we were fully booked.
All the reservations bailed.
Well, except one.
Hey, you. Look who it is.
It is Pinky Dick.
Sorry. I mean Sam.
Of course you remember Francis.
Charles, this is Pinky Dick.
I mean Sam.
Pinky-Dick-I-mean-Sam, this is Charles Siziba,  food blogger for <i>The Times</i>.
 It is nice to meet you.
Edwin has told me awful things about you.
Charles is helping me find the best West African chef in London because I'm starting my own Nigerian restaurant but 20 meters from here.
You're doing what?
We are going to serve the finest Nigerian cuisine, along with Chicago-style hot dogs, because it's my favorite food.
Oh, Sam. I mean Pinky Dick.
Mr. Akufo found a tiny piece of glass in his food.
I assume our meal will be complimentary?
Yeah, sure. Whatever.
Good man.
It is nice to put a name to such an ugly, horrible face.
I'm so sorry to see that business is not going well.
No. Actually, we were fully booked.
We just had a few last-second cancellations.
That's because all the reservations were me.
Hello. Ola's Chop Life?
Can I make a reservation for eight for Wiafe.
David Ettlemen, party of six.
Starkey, party of four. Fab four.
Table for 12, please. Last name Picard.
And please, bring out all of your finest African cheeses.
 Good to see you, Edwin.
 Isn't it?
Yes, I was so sad to hear that you were not selected for Nigeria's national team.
But I was happy to hear that the Nigerian government was pleased to accept a free $20 million check from me to keep you off the team.
I will never stop, you Nigerian turd.
Never ever.
No, never.
Please don't do this, Francis.
 Stop right there.
 Sorry.
 <i>What's the emergency?</i>  Nathan?
Yeah.
Never mind, Officer. My son is home.
You moved the key.
Jesus Christ.
Hey, Mum.
Do you want anything to eat, dear?
No, thank you. I just wanna sleep actually.
Well, if you're cooking, I could eat something.
Lloyd, stop.
What?
Leslie?
 Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
 It's okay. It's not too bad.
Damn.
How can I help, Rebecca?
I just need some advice.
 Keeley didn't text you back?
 She did not.
 Ted?
 Can't find him.
 Sassy?
 On a plane with no Wi-Fi.
 Can you imagine that?
 Disgusting.
 How about your mother?
 Are you fucking with me?
I am flattered. Okay, let's do this shit.
I don't want to be part of the Akufo League.
Why? Because he's an emotionally erratic billionaire with the temperament of one of those kids in Willy Wonka that gets murdered at the chocolate factory?
I don't think that's what happens, Leslie.
I hate to break it to you, Rebecca, but those children are dead.
I think the only reason Rupert has invited me in is because I'm a woman and it'll make them look good.
Who cares why Rupert invited you?
You've got a seat at the table.
So go and see what's what.
Thank you, Leslie.
And if any of the other people start disappearing one by one due to a series of unfortunate accidents seemingly caused by their own hubris, you get the hell out of there. Do you hear me?
Everything all right, dear?
Everything? Fuck no.
What is it called when you have the opposite of the Midas touch?
 The Midas shits.
 That's it. That's what I have.
Everything I touch turns to shit.
Shit helps things grow, love.
Oy, I'm Keeley. What's your name?
 Mae.
 Mae? I wasn't expecting that.
That's a really nice name.
 Short for anything?
 Maybe.
And is this your place, Maybe?
Little over 40 years.
Wow, that's impressive.
It's hard though, right? Being a boss?
It has its moments.
But for some, it's better to follow your gut than pretend to be excited by following someone else's.
What would you do if someone took it all away from you?
Like the man once said, "Once you make it to the top of the mountain, what's left for you but lightning?" Wait, is the lightning a good thing or a bad thing?
Depends whether you're ready for it or not.
Now, I'm gonna get you some food.
'Cause I can't have another sad, skinny girl pass out in my pub.
Fucks me Yelp rating.
Bocce balls.
Ted! Ted!
Hey.
Ye-- <i>You know, Lanny, when Mexico comes up here in our kitchen,</i> <i>the record books go right out the window.</i> <i>Well, for sure, Bruce.</i> <i>It's a tough game, but there's a begrudging mutual respect</i> <i>between the two teams, hey?</i> <i>- They go together like nachos and poutine.
 Now you've made me hungry. Oh, no.</i>  <i>Mexico gains possession.</i>  Here we go!
<i>Dani Rojas is on the loose, face-to-face with Van Damme. And--</i> <i>Oh, no! Right in the nose.</i> <i>Straight in the sniffer. That almost seemed deliberate.</i> Dani kicked the crap out of it too.
<i>For sure, Bruce. He's a different fella in a Mexico shirt.</i> <i>That's a lot of blood, for gosh sakes.</i> <i>I apologize for the language there, folks.</i> Hey.
Twins.
Fuck's sake.
All right, go on in.
 Have a nice day, Uncle Roy.
 You too.
You look nice.
 Sure.
 Bye!
It's Coach Kent.
 Hello, Ms. Bowen.
 You don't have to call me Ms. Bowen.
 You can use my first name.
 Okay...
You don't know it, do you?
No.
 Leann.
 Hello, Leann.
I like your T-shirt.
You off to protest the Vietnam War?
Phoebe made it for me.
 You look different.
 Well, yeah.
I don't normally dress like a fucking clown.
No, I don't mean the T-shirt. I mean you.
You seem lighter than the last time I saw you.
Less... stuck.
 Stuck?
 Yeah, stuck.
Hold on.
Weren't you flirting with me last time I saw you?
I teach kids. I don't mind cleaning up a mess.
I just hope that mess didn't cause too much damage.
Fudge.
 It's good to see you.
 Yeah, you too.
"I don't mind cleaning up a mess." Smooth move, fuckwitch.
All right, kids, let's go!
Hi, Barbara.
That's a nice outfit.
Thank you. Yes. I like clothes that tell the truth.
I got you something.
Thank you for all your help.
I really wish that we could have worked together longer.
You're fun.
 I am?
 Yeah.
Thank you.
It's just that I have to buy the snow globe, or it doesn't really count.
Okay.
 Do you have any cash on you?
 Yes.
It was actually 60 quid.
I think you paid a bit too much there.
Thank you for this.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna need the receipt.
 Of course. Can I email it to you?
 Yeah, email's great.
 Sooner the better.
 I'll get on it.
{\an8}Nathan, your father and I are headed to the farmers' market for a few hours.
We love you, sweetheart.
Hello, there. Good morning.
 Hello, madam.
 Hello there.
 Can I take your coat?
 Oh, yes, absolutely.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
Hello, Rebecca.
Rupert.
Thank you for accepting my invitation.
How could I resist the chance of having a bunch of old men speak directly to my chest?
Mr. Mannion, you left your phone in the car.
And your fecalist emailed your results.
Two big thumbs up as expected.
Wonderful.
Ms. Bread, Rebecca Welton.
Rebecca, this is my assistant, Ms. Bread.
Nice to meet you.
Excuse me.
 New assistant?
 Yeah.
What happened to the corporate pixie dream girl?
Skewed. Dramatic.
 Shall we?
 Yes.
So, gentlemen, hello.
I believe most of you know Rebecca, owner of AFC Richmond.
It's been my title since we got divorced, and I took the only thing he ever loved.
Wonderful.
 Rebecca.
 Hello, Robert.
When Rupert told me you were joining us today, I was truly excited.
Then when you walked in, in that outfit, I remember why.
Greetings to you all!
And thank you for coming.
Francis.
 Rebecca.
 Mr. Akufo, how wonderful to see you again.
Yes, I'm very glad that you are here.
It's nice to not be the only minority in the room, eh?
Gentlemen and lady, I'm sure you're all very anxious to get started.
But as my father would say, "Never talk business on an empty stomach." So...
Please take your seats and let us enjoy some delicious Ghanaian bites as well as some Chicago-style hot dogs, as enjoyed by the likes of Scottie Pippen, Obama and Ferris Bueller.
Please.
Yes, please. Please sit down. Sit down.
Thanks.
So, now that our bellies are full, let us talk business.
But first, there is one thing to take care of.
It's okay. I will leave now.
Yeah, no, thank you, Nicolay. It's just easier for everybody-- No. I get it.
It's just the whole Russia thing. You know, it's not a good look right now.
You-- It's a "pull." You have to pull. It's a-- It's a-- You're pushing. It's a pu-- You have to pull the door.
What you're doing is obviously w-- You're pushing, and you have to pull.
There. Okay, goodbye.
Okay, gentlemen. And one woman.
I invited you here to tell you about the Akufo League.
A global football league made up of only the best teams.
Yes, it will cost the fans a bit more, and some may not be able to afford it.
But those who can will see the cream of the crop.
Each matchup, a clash of titans.
Each game, an undried dream.
Now, in the beginning, some people will hate it because some people hate change.
But remember, at one time, we only rode horses and hated the idea of automobiles.
Now we can't live without our cars, and the hot dogs we just ate are 85% horse meat.
Change is inevitable.
Why should football not change?
Why should it not evolve?
Why should your profits not grow exponentially?
Yes, the fans will protest. They will whine.
They will make up mean-spirited but admittedly clever parody songs using our surnames and sing them outside the buildings that we own.
But in time, they will come to embrace the superior product.
Just as we have all embraced the automobile...
the smartphone...
the squatty potty.
The Akufo League is the future of football.
And the future is now.
Francis will pass out the projections for the first five years.
Please take a moment to peruse.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
Well, makes sense to me. I'm in.
Wonderful.
Rebecca, what do you think?
Is this a fucking joke?
Excuse me?
What do you think you're doing? Just stop it!
I mean, how much more money do any of you really need?
Why would you ever consider taking something away from people that means so much to them?
This isn't a game.
Football isn't just a game.
<i>England dominating. No surprise.</i> {\an8}<i>It's one of those amazing things in life that can make you feel shit one moment...</i> <i>You'd expect Southgate to be looking at his bench about now,</i> <i>and we do have a substitution.</i> <i>AFC Richmond's Jamie Tartt winning his first cap for England.</i> {\an8}<i>An unforgettable moment and well-earned.</i> <i>And then, like it's Christmas morning the next.</i> {\an8}<i>Tartt's wearing 24,</i> {\an8}<i>a nod to his Richmond teammate, the spectacular Sam Obisanya.</i> <i>It has the ability to make heroes and villains out of ordinary men.</i> <i>People love this game.</i> My father loved this game.
You all used to love this game.
I'm sure of it.
I knew this little boy. Working-class. From Richmond.
And he loved football so much, he used to sneak into the matches because his family just couldn't afford the tickets.
And one afternoon, he finally got caught.
And the security guard smacked him round the face, knocked him on the ground.
But that little boy stood up, smiled, kicked the security guard in the bollocks and ran away.
Never to return.
Until 25 years later, when he walked in and bought the entire club.
And on his first day as owner, he went and found that same security guard and gave him a pay rise without any explanation.
<i>Just because we own these teams doesn't mean they belong to us.</i> <i>And I don't want to be part of something</i> <i>that could possibly destroy this beautiful game.</i> Because I would hate for all those little kids and grown-ups out there to ever lose access to that beautiful, passionate part of themselves.
What a lovely speech.
Now, who wants to make a lot of money?
Jesus fucking Christ!
Hey, sorry.
I thought you'd gone out.
I did. But my acid reflux started playing up, so I came home.
I didn't know you had acid reflux.
I don't.
But your mother knows I like my alone time.
Sorry if I disturbed you.
No, not at all.
I really miss hearing you play.
You do?
Of course.
Thought you hated it when I played.
Why on earth would you think that?
'Cause you literally said that to me once, Dad.
You said I wouldn't practice enough.
How I was squandering my potential and wasting my privilege.
You were given opportunities I never had, and so I expected a lot from you.
Well, it scared the shit out of me.
I know that now.
And I'm sorry.
I didn't know how to parent a genius.
What?
A genius.
You're brilliant, Son.
You've always seen things other people couldn't, and that's a blessing.
Yeah, I know it must also be a curse too.
But you're right.
I pushed you to be the best at everything, even at violin.
'Cause I thought that's what I had to do.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I just liked playing.
Nathan, be successful, don't be successful.
I never cared about any of that.
I just want my son to be happy.
Well, that was all very interesting.
Lunch soon?
Yeah, sure.
Rebecca, you still look lovely.
You know, the last time I saw you two alone in a room together, was right after your wedding.
You really wanted me to leave.
Hey, remember when we-- we both snuck into a Richmond game together?
I do.
Although you were the owner of the club, so the stakes were a little bit lower.
You got-- May I?
Oh, yeah.
Rupert.
 Oi, what you doing there?
 Jesus fucking Christ!
Look at you in color.
 What are you doing here?
 I live here.
But it's the middle of the day.
What's that?
It's for you.
 You don't have to look now. You can--  I don't mind.
I still can't read your handwriting.
"Dear Keeley, I want you to know something.
You never did anything wrong. It was all me.
I was stuck. Stuck in my own shit.
And I didn't wanna cause you any harm with it, so I pulled away.
But you are..." You are and always will be Keeley fucking Jones.
And if I ever did anything-- anything at all-- that made you feel like that wasn't true...
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
"Sincerely yours, Roy Kent. XOXO." You are the only Roy I know.
 Well, I didn't want to assume.
 No.
Thank you.
Okay.
I win.
Come on.
Come on.
Have you been shot?
I just convinced a roomful of Rupert's dickhead friends to pull out of the Akufo League.
 Oh, no!
 Oh, no, it's very good. Hug me.
Oh, yes! I'm so proud of you!
Even though I don't totally get it.
Thank you. Wait.
Now that I know that you're actually alive, I'm very cross with you.
Where the hell have you been?
And they just pulled your funding?
Arseholes. Why didn't you tell me?
Well, I couldn't find the right time.
And the right way.
And I didn't want to.
Well, they are idiots.
Because you, Keeley Jones, are a bloody marvel.
How much money were they putting in?
No. I'm not letting you do that. It's a lot.
Oh, shut up. My money, my choice. Come on, tell me.
What are you doing?
This is how they do it in the movies.
Are you joking?
I told you.
I think I have that much money on me in cash.
 No.
 Yes.
 No!
 Yes.
Thank you!
 Rupert tried to kiss me.
 What?
Did your lips touch?
No, I pulled back straightaway.
And I just looked at him and made it all so clear.
Babe, that's huge.
Jesus. Can you imagine if you fell for it, and you got back with Rupert?
After all that floppy cock has done, you would have to be insane.
You would have to be at the bottom of your emotional barrel to do something that dumb, right?
Hi.
Thanks, Renee.
We've done some restructuring, but KJPR would still love to help you take your sunglasses global, Ms. Jayye.
I would maybe say "ambitious nightmare" over "crazy." But yes, we have parted ways with Shandy.
Okay. Of course. Great. Yeah, talk to you soon.
 Nice. Okay.
 Ms. Jones.
Barbara, hi. What are you doing here?
I need to give this back to you.
I've given Jack my resignation, and I only buy a snow globe when I leave a job.
I mean, that is, if you're looking for a CFO.
I mean, I might not-- It's-- Would you mind loosening your grip?
'Cause I need to get the receipt so you can reimburse me.
Thank you.
How are you?
<i>Hola, amigo</i>.
<i>Hola</i>.
How's your nose feeling, man?
It feels broken.
It was such a crazy game, right?
I mean, yeah. Yeah, it was.
So many memories.
He's hit the ball with his nose. Top ten moments in sports history.
 You good?
 Hey. Yeah, not bad.
So where are you from originally?
None of your business.
Yeah, it is a bit personal.
I'm from Peoria.
 Morning, boss.
 Good morning, Ted.
That's cool! Did you draw that?
No, Ted, that's a David Hockney.
Oh, well, he's a very talented little boy.
There you go.
Ted, I want to share something with you that I've realized recently.
How weird it is that Margherita pizza doesn't have alcohol in it?
I'm with you, sister.
No, Ted. I've realized I no longer care if I beat Rupert.
 Oh, yeah?
 Yeah.
I mean, I still want to win.
But for all of us.
For Richmond.
I wanna win for us too.
It just feels like it's ceremonial at this point.
As long as none of that tree piss gets in my mouth, I'm actually okay with it.
 @@@@@@
