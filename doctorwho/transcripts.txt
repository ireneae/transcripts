 Bye!
 See you later.
Bye!
<i>The store will be closing</i> <i>in five minutes. Thank you.</i> Hey!
Wilson?
Wilson, I've got the lottery money.
Wilson. Are you there?
I can't hang about 'cause they're closing the shop.
Wilson!
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Hello, Wilson. It's Rose.
Hello?
Wil... Wilson?
Wilson?
Wilson!
You're kidding me!
Is that someone mucking about?
Who is it?
You got me. Very funny Right, I've got the joke. Whose idea was this?
Is it Derek's? Is it?
Derek, is this you?
Run!
 You pulled his arm off!
 Yep. Plastic.
Nice trick. Who were they?
 Is it a student thing?
 Why would they be students?
 I don't know.
 You said it. Why students?
That many people dressed up and being silly. They gotta be students.
That makes sense. Well done.
 Thanks.
 They're not students.
Wilson will call the police.
 Wilson?
 Chief electrician.
Wilson's dead.
 That's not funny. That's sick.
 Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this now. Who are you, then? Who's that lot down there?
I said who are they?
They're living plastic creatures. They're controlled by a relay device on the roof, which would be a problem if I didn't have this.
I'm going to blow it up, and I might well die in the process, but don't worry about me  go home and have your beans on toast.
If you tell anyone about this, you'll get them killed.
 I'm the Doctor. You are?
 Rose.
Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life!
Watch it!
<i>Police investigate</i> <i>a fire in Central London.</i> I know. It's on the telly. It's everywhere.
She's lucky to be alive! It's aged her. Skin like an old Bible.
You'd think I was HER daughter. Here's himself.
I've been phoning your mobile. You could have been dead. I can't believe the shop went up!
I'm fine. Don't make a fuss.
 What happened?
 I don't know.
 What caused it?
 I wasn't in the shop. I didn't see anything.
Debbie knows a man on the "Mirror". 500 quid for an interview.
Brilliant. Give it here.
You've got to find some way of making money. I'm not bailing you out.
Bev! She's alive!
I've told her. Sue for compensation. She was within seconds of death!
 Is that tea? You need something stronger.
 I'm all right.
You deserve a proper drink.
 Let's go down the pub.
 Is there a match on?
 No! I'm just thinking about you.
 There's a match on.
 We could catch the last five minutes.
 Go on, then. I'm fine. Go. Get rid of that.
 Bye!
 Bye.
<i>It's thought there's very little chance</i> <i>of saving the infrastructure.</i> There's no point in getting up, sweetheart. You've got no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
 They've always got jobs.
 Oh, great. The butcher's It might do you good. That shop gave you airs and graces. I mean it about compensation.
You've had shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council 'cause the old man at the desk said she looked Greek.
She IS Greek, but that's not the point. It was a valid claim.
Mum, I told you to nail that cat flap down. We're gonna get strays.
 I did it weeks back!
 You thought about it.
What are you doing here?
 I live here.
 What for?
'Cause I do. I'm only here 'cause someone blew up my job.
I must have the wrong signal. You're not plastic, are you? No, bonehead. Bye, then.
Inside. Right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night. Give us ten minutes.
She deserves compensation.
Oh, we're talking millions!
Um...
 I'm in my dressing gown.
 Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
Well, anything could happen.
No.
 Don't mind the mess. Do you want a coffee?
 Might as well, thanks. Just milk.
 We should go to the police. Seriously.
 That won't last. He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you.
 Even if it was a joke that went wrong.
 Hmm. Sad ending.
 It said on the news they found a body.
 "Rose Tyler." Ah! Could have been worse. Look at the ears!
 He was a nice bloke. <i>- Luck be a lady...</i> If we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying. I want you to explain everything.
Maybe not!
What's that, then?
 Have you got a cat?
 No.
We did have, but now we just get strays. They come in off the estate.
 I told Mickey to chuck that out.
 You're all the same. Give a man a plastic hand Anyway, I don't even know your name. Doctor what?
Agh!
I've stopped it. See?
 'Armless  Do you think?
 You can't just go swanning off!
 Yes, I can. This is me swanning off.
 That arm tried to kill me!
 Well observed.
You can't just walk away.
 You've got to tell me what's going on.
 No, I don't.
All right. I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone. You said if I did that, I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
 Tell me or I'll start talking.
 Is that supposed to sound tough?
 Sort of.
 It doesn't work.
 Who are you?
 Told you. The Doctor.
 Doctor what?
 Just the Doctor.
 The Doctor?
 Hello!
 Is that supposed to sound impressive?
 Sort of.
Come on. You can tell me. I've seen enough. Are you the police?
No! I was just passing through. I'm a long way from home.
What have I done wrong? Why are those plastic things after me?
Suddenly the entire world revolves around you  You just got in the way.
It tried to kill me.
It was after me, not you. I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined the whole thing.
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down. It only fixed on you 'cause you met me.
So you're saying the entire world revolves around you.
 Sort of, yeah.
 You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah!
All this plastic stuff  who else knows about it?
 No one.
 What, you're on your own?
Who else is there? I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, go to bed and watch telly, while underneath you there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
If we're going with the living plastic  I don't even believe that  how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into the arm. I cut off the signal.
 So that's radio control?
 Thought control.
 Are you all right?
 Yeah.
 So who's controlling it, then?
 Long story.
What's it all for? I mean, shop window dummies. What's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
No!
 Well, no.
 It's not a price war!
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you. Do you believe me?
 No.
 But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor... tell me. Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying about the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid and they tell you that the world's turning, but everything looks like it's standing still.
I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet spinning at 1,000 miles an hour, and the entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67,000 miles an hour, and I can feel it.
We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
 Hey-hey! Here's my woman. Kit off!
 Shut up.
 Coffee?
 Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
 Not rinse, wash. Can I use your computer?
 Yeah. Any excuse to get in the bedroom!
Don't read my emails!
You're not coming in. He's safe. He's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that? He did. That's exactly what an internet murderer would say!
Hello. I've come to see Clive. We've been emailing.
Dad!
One of your nutters!
Oh, sorry. Hello. You must be Rose. I'm Clive, obviously.
My boyfriend's waiting in the car  just in case you're gonna kill me Good point. No murders!
 Who is it?
 It's to do with the Doctor.
She's been reading the website. Come through. I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read the website about the Doctor and she's a she?
A lot of this stuff's quite sensitive. I couldn't just send it to you. People might intercept it.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor crops up all over the place 
political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just "the Doctor"  always "the Doctor".
And the title seems to be passed down from father to son  an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there.
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive last year. That photo's enhanced.
This is the original.
November 22nd 1963. The assassination of President Kennedy.
 It must be his father.
 Going further back...
April 1912.
This is the Daniels family of Southampton and friend.
This was taken the day before they were due to sail on the Titanic.
For some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip and survived. Here we are...
1883. Another Doctor.
Look  the same lineage. It's identical.
This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra the night that Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history. When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings a storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, then one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on, then!
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls...
then God help you!
Agh!
Who is he? Who do you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter! Off his head. A complete online conspiracy freak. You win.
What are we gonna do tonight? I fancy a pizza.
 Pizza! Puh-puh-pizza!
 Or a Chinese.
Pizza!
Do you think I should try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen. Is that it, then  dishing out chips?
I could do A levels.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault. I only left school 'cause of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
 Where did you meet this Doctor?
 Sorry. Did I talk about me then It started at the shop, right? Was he something to do with that?
 No.
 Come on.
Sort of.
 What was he doing there?
 I'm not going on about it, Mickey. I'm not.
I know it sounds daft but I don't think he's safe. He's dangerous.
 You can trust me, sweetheart. <i>- Babe. Sugar.</i> Tell me what the Doctor's planning and I can help you, Rose.
 That's all I really want to do, sweetheart. <i>- Babe. Sugar. Sweetheart.</i> What are you doing?
 Your champagne.
 We didn't order it.
 Where's the Doctor?
 Your champagne.
It's not ours. Mickey, what's wrong?
I need to find out how much he knows.
 Don't you want champagne?
 We didn't order it.
 Ah! Gotcha!
 Don't mind me.
Just toasting the happy couple. On the house!
Anyway...
That's not gonna stop me.
Everyone out now!
Get out! Get out!
Open the gate! Use that tube thing.
 Sonic screwdriver.
 Use it!
Nah. Let's go in here.
You can't hide inside a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
He's gonna follow us!
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door. Believe me, they've tried.
You see, the arm was too simple, but the head is perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right. Where do you want to start?
The inside is bigger than the outside.
 Yes.
 It's alien.
Yep.
Are you alien?
Yes.
 Is that all right?
 Yeah.
It's called the Tardis. T-A-R-D-l-S. Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK. Culture shock.
 Happens to the best of us.
 Did they kill him? Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead?
Oh. I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend. You pulled off his head. They copied him and you didn't even think?
 And now you're just gonna let him melt?
 Melt?
 No, no, no!
 What are you doing?
Following the signal. It's fading.
No, no!
Almost there.
Here we go.
You can't go out there. It's not safe.
I lost the signal. I got so close!
 We've moved. Does it fly?
 Disappears there and reappears here.
What about that headless thing? It's still on the loose.
 It melted with the head. Stop wittering on.
 I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey. I'll have to tell his mother he's dead. You forgot him again!
 You were right. You ARE alien.
 If I did forget some kid, it's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape on this planet, all right?
 All right.
 Yes, it is!
 Why do you sound like you're from the north?
 Lots of planets have a north.
What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box from the 1950s.
 It's a disguise.
 OK.
 This living plastic, what's it got against us?
 Nothing. It loves you.
You have a great planet. Lots of smoke and oil, toxins and dioxins in the air. Perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs. Its food stock was destroyed.
 Its protein planets rotted, so Earth  dinner!
 Can you stop it?
 Antiplastic.
 Antiplastic?
First I've got to find it. How can you hide something that big?
 What?
 The transmitter.
The Consciousness controls the plastic. The transmitter boosts the signal.
 What does it look like?
 Like a transmitter. Round and massive.
Slap bang in the middle of London. A huge metal circular structure. Like a wheel.
Close to where we're standing. Must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it? What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think of it  plastic all over the world. Everything coming alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires.
 The cables...
 The breast implants.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness. That's it inside the vat. A living plastic creature.
 Tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
 I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with you under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you. If I might have permission to approach?
Oh, God!
Mickey, it's me. It's OK.
It's all right.
That thing down there  the liquid, Rose  it can talk!
You're stinking! Doctor, they kept him alive!
That was always a possibility. That way, they maintain the copy.
 You knew that and never said?
 Can we keep the domestics outside?
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you. You infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp-shunt technology, so may I respectfully suggest that you shunt off?
It's an invasion, plain and simple. Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I am talking!
This planet is just starting. These stupid people have only just learnt to walk, but they're capable of so much more.
 I'm asking you on their behalf. Please go.
 Doctor!
It was just insurance. I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you. I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy. I swear I'm not.
What do you mean? No!
Honestly, no!
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true. I should know. I was there. I fought in the war. It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world or any of them.
What's it doing?
The Nestene's identified the Tardis as superior technology. It's terrified.
It's going to the final base. It's starting the invasion. Get out, Rose. Just leg it now!
 Mum?
 There you are. I was just gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation. I've got this document off the police. Don't thank me.
 Where are you, Mum?
 I'm in town.
 Just go home right now.
 You're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit of late-night shopping. See you later. Ta-ra!
Mum? Mum!
It's the activation signal. It's transmitting!
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
God! I thought they were dummies. I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true. Everything I read  all the stories  it's all true.
 Get out, Rose! Just get out! Run!
 The stairs have gone!
I haven't got the key!
We're gonna die.
Agh!
Agh!
 No!
 Time Lord!
Just leave him!
 There's nothing you can do!
 I've got no A levels.
No job. No future.
But I'll tell you what I HAVE got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s Gymnastics Team.
I've got the bronze.
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose! Don't go out of the house. It's not safe.
<i>These things were shooting...</i> Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
 Nestene Consciousness? Easy!
 You were useless in there.
 You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
 Yes, I would. Thank you.
Right, then, I'll be off... unless...
I don't know... You could come with me.
This box goes anywhere in the universe free of charge.
Don't. He's an alien. He's a thing!
He's not invited.
What do you think?
You could stay here, fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go anywhere.
 Is it always this dangerous?
 Yeah.
Yeah, I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum, and someone's got to look after this stupid lump, so...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go. Come on.
Come on.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
 Thanks.
 Thanks for what?
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Run.
 I'm the Doctor.
 I'm Rose.
Nice to meet you. Run!
It's following us!
Genghis Khan couldn't get in here and he's tried.
 Are you alien?
 Yes.
Come with me.
 Is it always dangerous?
 Yeah.
Right, Rose Tyler, do you want to go backwards or forwards in time?
 It's your choice. What's it going to be?
 Forwards.
 How far?
 100 years.
 Step outside. It's the 22nd century.
 You're kidding?
 Do you want to go further?
 Fine by me.
10,000 years in the future. Step outside. It's 12005. The new Roman Empire.
 You think you're so impressive.
 I am.
 You wish!
 You asked for it. I know where to go.
Hold on.
Where are we?
What's out there?
You lot spend all your time thinking about dying 
like you're going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or asteroids.
You never take time to imagine the impossible  that you'll survive.
This is the year 5.5/Apple/26.
Five billion years in your future.
And this is the day... Hold on.
This is the day the Sun expands.
Welcome to the end of the world.
<i>Shuttles Five and Six now docking.</i> <i>Guests are reminded that Platform One</i> <i>forbids the use of weapons,</i> <i>teleportation and religion.</i> <i>Earth death is scheduled for 15.39,</i> <i>followed by drinks in the Manchester Suite.</i>  "Guests"? Does that mean people?
 Depends what you mean by people.
 I mean people. What do you mean?
 Aliens.
What are they doing on board this spaceship?
It's more an observation deck. The great and the good are going to watch the planet burn.
 What for?
 Fun.
When I say "the great and the good", I mean the rich.
But they did this on "Newsround Extra"  the sun expanding. It takes hundreds of years.
The planet belongs to the National Trust. They've been preserving it.
See there? Gravity satellites holding back the sun.
The planet looks the same. I thought the continents shifted.
They did and the Trust shifted them back. That's a classic Earth.
Now the money's run out, nature takes over.
 How long's it got?
 About half an hour. Then it gets roasted.
Is that why we're here? Do you jump in at the last minute and save the Earth?
 I'm not saving it. Time's up.
 What about the people?
It's empty. They've all gone. No one left.
 Just me, then.
 Who the hell are you?
 That's nice. Thanks.
 How did you get in?
This is a maximum hospitality zone. The guests have disembarked.
That's me. I'm a guest. I've got an invitation. Look. It's fine.
"The Doctor plus one." I'm the Doctor and this is Rose Tyler. All right?
Well... obviously.
Apologies, etcetera.
If you're on board, we'd better start. Enjoy.
The paper's psychic. It shows them what I want them to see.
 Saves a lot of time.
 He's blue.
 Yeah.
 OK.
We have in attendance the Doctor and Rose Tyler.
Thank you. All staff to their positions.
Hurry, now. Quick as we can. Come along, come along.
Might I introduce the next honoured guest?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have trees, namely Jabe, Lute and Coffa.
There will be an exchange of gifts representing peace.
Keep the room circulating. Next, from the solicitors Jolco and Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon.
And next, from Financial Family Seven, we have the Adherents of the Repeated Mean...
The inventors of Hypo-Slip Travel Systems, the brothers Hop Pyleen...
Cal Spark Plug... Mr and Mrs Pacoon...
Ambassadors from the city state of Binding Light...
The gift of peace. I bring you a cutting of my grandfather.
Thank you. Yes. Gifts...
I give you in return... air from my lungs.
How... intimate.
 There's more where that came from.
 I bet there is.
From the Silver Devastation, the sponsor of the main event, please welcome the Face of Boe.
The Moxx of Balhoon.
My felicitations upon this historical happenstance.
I bring you the gift of bodily salivas.
Thank you.
Ah, the Adherents of the Repeated Mean. I bring you air from my lungs.
A gift of peace in all good faith.
Last, but not least, our very special guest.
Ladies and gentlemen and trees and multiforms... consider the Earth below.
In memory of this dying world, we call forth the last human.
The lady Cassandra O'Brien. Delta 17.
Now, don't stare. I know. I know, it's shocking, isn't it?
I've had my chin completely taken away and look at the difference.
Look how thin I am. Thin and dainty. I don't look a day over 2,000.
Moisturise me. Moisturise me.
Truly I am the last human.
My father was a Texan, my mother was from the Arctic desert.
They were born on the Earth and they were the last to be buried in its soil.
I have come to honour them and to say goodbye.
No tears. No tears... I'm sorry.
But behold, I bring gifts.
From Earth itself, the last remaining ostrich egg.
Legend says it had a wingspan of 50 feet and blew fire from its nostrils.
Or was that my third husband? No, don't laugh. I'll get laughter lines.
And here, another rarity.
According to the archives, this was called an iPod.
It stores classical music from humanity's greatest composers. Play on.
Refreshments are served.
Earth death in 30 minutes.
<i>Sometimes I feel I've got to... run away</i> <i>I've got to... get away</i> <i>From the pain</i> <i>you drive into the heart of me</i> <i>The love we share</i> <i>Seems to go nowhere</i> <i>And I've lost my light</i> <i>For I toss and turn</i> <i>I can't sleep at night...</i> Doctor? Thank you.
A gift of peace in all good faith.
 You're kind, but I'm just the steward.
 A gift of peace in all good faith.
Well, yes. Thank you. Of course.
Identify species.
Please identify species.
Stop it. Identify his race. Where's he from?
It's impossible.
Sorry. Am I allowed to be in here?
You have to give us permission to talk.
Er... You have permission.
Thank you. And no, you're not in the way. Guests are allowed anywhere.
OK.
 What's your name?
 Raffalo.
Raffalo?
Yes, miss. I won't be long. I've just got to carry out some maintenance.
There's a glitch in the Face of Boe's suite.
There must be something blocking the system. He's not getting hot water.
 So you're a plumber?
 That's right, miss.
 You still have plumbers?
 Else I'm out of a job.
 Where are you from?
 Crespallion.
 That's a planet, isn't it?
 No.
It's part of the Jaggit Brocade, affiliated to the Scarlet Junction.
Convex 56. Where are you from, miss? If you don't mind me asking.
No, not at all. Um...
I don't know. A long way away.
I just sort of hitched a lift with this man.
I didn't even think about it. I don't even know who he is.
He's a complete stranger.
Anyway, don't let me keep you. Good luck with it.
Thank you, miss, and er...
Thank you for the permission. Not many people are that considerate.
OK. See you later.
Now, then...
Control, I'm at Junction 19. I think the problem's here. I'll go in and have a look.
What's that? Is something in there?
Who are you, then? Hold on!
If you're an upgrade, I just need to register you. Come back.
There you are.
I need to register your ident.
Oh, there's two of you. Got yourself a little mate.
I think I'd better report this to Control. How many of you are there?
What are you?
No, please... No! No!
What's that?
How should I know?
Would the owner of the blue box in Gallery 15 please report to the Steward's office?
Guests are reminded that the use of teleportation devices is strictly forbidden under peace treaty 5.4/Cup/16. Thank you.
<i>- Earth death in 25 minutes.</i>  <i>- Earth death in 25 minutes.</i> Oh, thanks.
Hello.
My name's Rose. That's a sort of plant.
We might be related.
I'm talking to a twig.
Careful with that. Park it properly. No scratches.
Rose? Are you in there?
Aye, aye.
 What do you think, then?
 Great. Yeah. Fine.
Once you get past the slightly psychic paper.
They're just so alien.
The aliens are so alien.
You look at 'em and they're alien.
Good thing I didn't take you to the Deep South.
 Where are you from?
 All over the place.
 They all speak English.
 No. You hear English.
It's the Tardis. The telepathic field gets into your brain and translates.
 It's inside my brain?
 In a good way.
Your machine gets inside my head and changes my mind and you didn't even ask?
 I didn't think of it.
 No.
You were too busy thinking up cheap shots about the Deep South!
Who are you, then, Doctor? What sort of alien are you?
 I'm just the Doctor.
 From what planet?
 You wouldn't know it.
 Where are you from?
 Why?
 Tell me who you are.
This is who I am, right here and now. All that counts is here and now and this is me!
And I'm here too 'cause you brought me! So just tell me!
<i>Earth death in 20 minutes.</i> <i>Earth death in 20 minutes.</i> All right.
As my mate Shereen says, "Don't argue with the designated driver." Can't exactly call for a taxi.
There's no signal. We're out of range. Just a bit.
 With a bit of jiggery-pokery...
 Is that a technical term?
 Yeah. I came first in jiggery-pokery. You?
 No. I failed hullabaloo.
There you go.
<i>Hello?</i>  Mum?
 What is it? What have I done now?
This red top's falling to bits. You should get your money back.
You never phone in the middle of the day. What's so funny?
 Nothing. You all right?
 Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
 What day is it?
 Wednesday. All day.
You got a hangover? Put a quid in that Lottery syndicate. I'll pay you back later.
Yeah. I was just calling 'cause I might be late home.
 Is there something wrong?
 No. I'm fine.
Top of the world.
Think that's amazing, you want to see the bill.
That was five billion years ago. So...
She's dead now.
 Five billion years later, my mum's dead.
 Bundle of laughs, you are.
That's not supposed to happen.
What was it? I'm just getting green lights at this end.
Guests may be reassured that gravity pockets may cause slight turbulence.
The whole place shook! I felt it.
I've hosted events on Platforms One, Three, Six and 15 and I've never felt a tremor.
If this lot decide to sue... I'm going to scan the infrastructure.
What's that? Control, I don't want to worry you, but I'm picking up readings...
I have no idea.
They're small. The scan says they're metal. I don't know what they look like!
Although I imagine they might look rather like that.
You're not on the guest list. How did you get on board?
No!
 <i>Sun filter deactivated.</i>   No!
<i>Sun filter descending.</i>  Sun filter up! <i>- External temperature 4,000 degrees.</i>  Control, respond! Sun filter up! <i>- Sun filter descending.</i> Indubitably, this is the bad-move scenario. I find the inherent laxity of the ongoing...
That wasn't a gravity pocket. They don't feel like that.
What do you think, Jabe? Listen to the engines. They've pitched up about 30 hertz.
It's the sound of metal. It doesn't make sense to me.
 Where's the engine room?
 I don't know.
The maintenance duct is behind our suite. I could show you and... your wife.
She's not my wife.
 Partner?
 No.
 Concubine?
 No.
 Prostitute?
 Whatever I am, it must be invisible!
You two go and pollinate.
I'll catch up with the family. Word with Michael Jackson.
Don't start a fight. I'm all yours.
And I want you home by midnight.
<i>- Earth death in 15 minutes.</i>  <i>- Earth death in 15 minutes.</i> Who's in charge of Platform One? Is there a captain?
Just the steward and the staff. The rest is controlled by the metal mind.
The computer? Who controls that?
The corporation. They move Platform One from one artistic event to another.
But no one from the corporation is on board?
They're not needed. This facility is purely automatic.
 Nothing can go wrong.
 Unsinkable?
If you like. The nautical metaphor is appropriate.
I was on board another ship they said was unsinkable.
I ended up clinging to an iceberg.
So if we get in trouble, there's no one to help us out?
 I'm afraid not.
 Fantastic.
I don't understand. In what way is that fantastic?
Soon the Sun will blossom into a red giant and my home will die.
That's where I used to live when I was a little boy.
Mummy and Daddy had a house built into the side of the Los Angeles crevasse.
I'd have such fun.
What happened to the human race? Where did it go?
They say mankind has touched every star in the sky.
 So you're not the last human?
 I am the last pure human.
The others mingled.
They call themselves new humans, proto-humans, digi-humans, even human-ish, but do you know what I call them? Mongrels.
Right. And you stayed behind.
I kept myself pure.
How many operations have you had?
708. Next week it's 709. I'm having my blood bleached.
Is that why you wanted a word? You could be flatter.
 You've got a bit of a chin poking out.
 I'd rather die.
 It doesn't hurt.
 No, I mean it. I would rather die.
It's better to die than live like you  a bitchy trampoline.
What do you know?
I was born on that planet and so was my mum and dad and that makes me the last human being.
You're not human.
You've had it all flattened until there's nothing left.
Anything human got chucked in the bin. You're just skin. Lipstick and skin.
Nice talking.
So, Jabe, what's a tree like you doing in a place like this?
 Respect for the Earth.
 Come on. Everyone here's worth zillions.
Perhaps it's having to be seen at the right occasions.
In case your shares drop? You've got massive forests everywhere.
There's always money in land.
All the same, we respect the Earth as family.
So many species evolved from that planet. Mankind is only one. I'm another.
My ancestors were transplanted from the planet down below.
I'm a direct descendant of the tropical rainforest.
Excuse me.
What about your ancestry?
Perhaps you could tell a story or two.
Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when there's nothing else left.
I scanned you earlier.
The metal machine had trouble identifying your species and even when it named you, I wouldn't believe it.
But it was right.
I know where you're from.
Forgive me for intruding but it's remarkable that you even exist.
I just wanted to say...
... how sorry I am.
Is it me or is it a bit nippy?
That's a great bit of air conditioning.
Nice and old-fashioned. I bet they call it retro.
Gotcha.
 What the hell's that?
 Is it part of the retro?
I don't think so. Hold on.
 Hey, nice liana.
 Thanks. I shouldn't show them in public.
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. Who's been bringing their pets on board?
 What does it do?
 Sabotage.
 <i>Earth death in ten minutes.</i>   The temperature's about to rocket.
 The planet's end.
 Come gather! Come gather!
Bid farewell to the cradle of civilisation.
Let us mourn her with a traditional ballad.
<i>Baby, can't you see I'm calling?</i> <i>A guy like you should wear a warning</i> <i>It's dangerous, I'm falling...</i> Hold on. Get back.
 <i>Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.</i>   Is the steward in there?
You can smell him.
There's another sun filter programmed to descend.
<i>Too high, can't come down</i> <i>Losing my head, spinning round and round</i> <i>Do you feel me now...</i> <i>- Sun filter descending.</i>  <i>- Sun filter descending.</i>  <i>Sun filter descending.</i>  Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
 Let me out! <i>- Sun filter descending.</i> <i>Sun filter descending.</i>  Anyone in there?
 Let me out!
 It would be you.
 Open the door!
 Give us two ticks. <i>- Sun filter descending.</i> <i>Sun filter descending.</i> <i>Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.</i> <i>Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.</i>  <i>Sun filter descending.</i>  The computer's getting clever.
 Stop mucking about!
 I'm not. It's fighting back.
 Open the door!
 I know!
The lock's melted!
<i>Sun filter descending.</i> <i>Sun filter descending.</i> <i>Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.</i>  The whole thing's jammed. Stay there.
 Where am I going to go, Ipswich?
<i>Earth death in five minutes.</i> The metal machine confirms  the spiders have infiltrated the whole of Platform One.
How is that possible?
Our rooms are protected by a code wall. Moisturise me.
 Summon the steward.
 I'm afraid the steward is dead.
Who killed him?
This event was sponsored by the Face of Boe. He invited us. Talk to the Face!
Someone brought their pet on board.
Let's send him back to master.
The Adherents of the Repeated Mean. J'accuse!
That's all very well and obvious, but if you think about it...
A repeated mean is just an idea and that's all they are  an idea.
Remote-controlled droids. Cover for the real troublemaker.
Go on, Jimbo. Go home.
I bet you were the school swot and never got kissed.
 At arms!
 Are you going to moisturise me?
With acid. You're too late anyway.
My spiders have control of the mainframe.
You all carried them as gifts, tax-free, past every code wall.
I'm not just a pretty face.
Sabotaging a ship you're on? How stupid's that?
I'd hoped to manufacture a hostage situation, with myself as a victim.
 The compensation would have been huge.
 Five billion years and it's still money.
Do you think it's cheap looking like this? Flatness costs a fortune.
I am the last human, Doctor. Me. Not that freaky little kid of yours.
 Arrest her. Infidel.
 Oh, shut it, pixie!
 I've still got my final option. <i>- Earth death in three minutes.</i> And here it comes. You're all just as useful dead.
I have shares in your rival companies. They'll triple in price once you're dead.
My spiders are ready to destroy the safety systems.
How does that old Earth song go?
 "Burn, Baby, Burn".
 Then you'll burn with us.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I know the use of teleportation is strictly forbidden, but... I'm so naughty.
Spiders, activate!
Force-field's gone with the planet about to explode.
At least it'll be quick.
Just like my fifth husband. Oh, shame on me.
Bye-bye, darlings. Bye-bye, my darlings.
<i>Heat levels rising.</i>  Reset the computer.
 The steward would know how.
No. We can do it. There must be a system restore switch. Jabe, come on.
You lot, just chill.
<i>Earth death in two minutes.</i> <i>Earth death in two minutes.</i> <i>Heat levels critical.</i> <i>Heat levels critical.</i> Oh. And guess where the switch is.
<i>Heat levels rising. Heat levels rising.</i> <i>External temperature 5,000 degrees.</i> You can't. The heat will vent through here.
 I know.
 Jabe, you're made of wood.
Then stop wasting time... Time Lord.
<i>Heat levels rising. Heat levels rising.</i>  We're going to die! <i>- Heat levels hazardous.</i> <i>Shields malfunction.</i> <i>Shields malfunction.</i> <i>Shields malfunction.</i> <i>Shields malfunction.</i> <i>Heat levels critical.</i> <i>Heat levels critical.</i> <i>Heat levels rising. Heat levels rising.</i> <i>Land explodes in... ten...</i> <i>Nine...</i> <i>Eight...</i> <i>Seven...</i> <i>Six...</i> <i>Five...</i> <i>Four...</i> Raise shields!
<i>One...</i> <i>Exoglass repair. Exoglass repair.</i> <i>Exoglass repair. Exoglass repair.</i>  You all right?
 Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm full of ideas. I'm bristling with them.
Idea one  teleportation through 5,000 degrees needs some kind of feed.
Idea two  this feed must be hidden nearby.
Idea three  if you're as clever as me, then a teleportation feed can be reversed.
You should have seen their little alien faces...
 Oh!
 The last human.
You passed my little test. Bravo. This makes you eligible to join... the Human Club.
 People have died. You murdered them.
 It depends on your definition of people.
That should keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries.
Take me to court, Doctor, and watch me smile and cry and...
And creak?
 And what?
 Creak. You're creaking.
What?
I'm drying out.
Sweet heavens! Moisturise me! Moisturise me! Where are my surgeons?
 My lovely boys! It's too hot.
 You raised the temperature.
Have pity! Moisturise me!
 Oh, Doctor...
 Help her.
Everything has its time and everything dies.
I am... too... young!
<i>Shuttles Four and Six departing.</i> <i>This unit now closing down for maintenance.</i> The end of the Earth.
It's gone.
We were too busy saving ourselves. No one saw it go.
All those years, all that history, and no one was even looking.
 It's just...
 Come with me.
"Big Issue".
"Big Issue".
You think it'll last for ever  people and cars and concrete.
But it won't. One day it's all gone.
Even the sky.
My planet's gone. It's dead.
It burned like the Earth.
It's just rocks and dust.
Before its time.
 What happened?
 There was a war and we lost.
A war with who?
What about your people?
I'm a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords.
They're all gone. I'm the only survivor.
I'm left travelling on my own 'cause there's no one else.
There's me.
You've seen it's dangerous. Do you want to go home?
I don't know...
I want...
 Can you smell chips?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I want chips.
Me too.
Chips it is, and you can pay.
 No money.
 What sort of date are you?
Come on, tight-wad. Chips are on me.
We've only got five billion years till the shops close.
Let's have a look at the past. 1860. How does 1860 sound?
 What happened in 1860?
 Let's find out.
 I can't believe she's gone.
 Not gone, Mr Redpath. Merely sleeping.
 She's on her feet and out there somewhere.
 For shame! It's ungodly.
Mr Dickens, this is your call.
Use the sight. Find the old lady or you're dismissed.
What phantasmagoria is this?
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Sneed And Company offer their sincerest condolences, sir, in this most trying hour.
Grandmama had a good innings, Mr Sneed. She was so full of life.
 I can't believe she's gone.
 Not gone, Mr Redpath. Merely sleeping.
 May I have a moment?
 Yes, of course.
I shall be in the next room should you need anything.
Oh, no.
Gwyneth! Get down here now! We've got another one!
 Hold that one down.
 I am!
 Hold them both down!
 It won't work!
I promised you a time machine.
We've seen the future. Let's see the past.
 How does 1860 sound?
 What happened in 1860?
I don't know. Let's find out. Hold on.
Gwyneth! Where are you, girl?
Gwyneth!
Where have you been? I was shouting.
 The stables, breaking the ice for Samson.
 Go back and harness him up.
 Whatever for, sir?
 The stiffs are getting lively again.
Mr Redpath's grandmother is up and out there somewhere. We've got to find her.
Mr Sneed, how many more times? It's ungodly.
Don't look at me like it's my fault. Hurry up. She was 86. She can't have got far.
What about Mr Redpath? Did you deal with him?
No... she did.
That's awful, sir.
I know it's not my place and please forgive me for talking out of turn, sir, but this is getting beyond now.
Something terrible is happening here and we need to get help.
And we will... as soon as I get that dead old woman locked up.
Stop prevaricating, get the hearse ready. We're going body-snatching.
 Blimey!
 Are you all right?
Yeah, I think so. Nothing broken. Did we make it?
I did it. Give the man a medal. Earth, Naples. December 24th 1860.
That's so weird. It's Christmas.
All yours.
But it's like... Think about it, though. Christmas 1860.
It happens once, just once, and it's gone. It's finished. It'll never happen again.
Except for you.
You can go back and see days that are dead and gone 100,000 sunsets ago.
 No wonder you never stay still.
 Not a bad life?
Better with two.
Come on.
 Where are you going?
 1860.
Like that? You'll start a riot, Barbarella. There's a wardrobe.
First left, second right, past the bins, fifth door on your left. Hurry up.
Not a sign. Where is she?
She's vanished into the ether, sir. Where can she be?
 You tell me, girl.
 What do you mean?
 Gwyneth, you know full well.
 No, sir. I can't.
 Use the sight.
 It's not right, sir.
Find the old lady or you're dismissed.
Now... look inside, girl. Look deep.
Where is she?
She's lost, sir.
She's so alone. Oh, my Lord. So many strange things in her head.
But where?
She was excited about tonight.
 Before she passed on, she was to see him.
 Who's him?
The great man.
All the way from London. The great, great man.
Mr Dickens? Excuse me, sir. This is your call.
 Are you quite well, sir?
 Splendid. Sorry.
 Time you were on, sir.
 Absolutely.
I was just brooding. Christmas Eve.
Not the best of times to be alone.
Did no one travel with you, sir? No lady wife?
 Afraid not.
 You can have mine, if you want.
I wouldn't dare.
I've been rather... let's say clumsy with family matters.
Thank God I'm too old to cause any more trouble.
 You speak as if it's all over, sir.
 No. It's never over.
On and on I go... the same old show.
I'm like a ghost, condemned to repeat myself through all eternity.
It's never too late, sir. You can think up some new turns.
No, I can't. Even my imagination grows stale.
I'm an old man. Perhaps I've thought everything I'll ever think.
Still... The lure of the limelight's as potent as a pipe, what?
On with the motley.
 Blimey!
 Don't laugh.
You look beautiful.
 Considering.
 Considering what?
That you're human.
I think that's a compliment. Are you changing?
 I've changed my jumper. Come on.
 You stay there. This is mine.
Ready for this?
Here we go. History.
"GOD REST YE MERRY, GENTLEMEN")  She's in there, sir. I'm certain of it.
 Right.
 I got the flight a bit wrong.
 I don't care.
 It's not 1860, it's 1869.
 I don't care.
 And it's not Naples.
 I don't care.
It's Cardiff.
Right.
Now, it is a fact that there was nothing particular at all about the knocker on the door of this house, but let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change...
not a knocker, but Marley's face.
Marley's face!
It looked at Scrooge...
... as Marley used to look.
It looked like...
Oh, my Lord.
It looked... like that.
What phantasmagoria is this?
That's more like it.
Stay in your seats... I beg you.
It is a lantern show. It's trickery.
 Excuse me.
 There she is, sir!
I can see that.
The whole blooming world can see that!
Fantastic.
 Did you see where it came from?
 Ah, the wag reveals himself.
 I trust you're satisfied, sir!
 Oi! Leave her alone! I'll get them!
Be careful! Did it say anything? Can it speak?
 I'm the Doctor.
 You look more like a navvy.
What's wrong with this jumper?
 What are you doing?
 It's a tragedy, miss. We'll deal with it.
This poor lady's been taken with the brain fever.
She's cold. She's dead. What did you do to her?
 What did you do that for?
 She's seen too much. Get her in. Legs.
Gas. It's made of gas.
 Rose!
 You're not escaping me, sir.
What do you know about that hobgoblin?
Projection on glass? Who put you up to it?
Yeah, mate. Not now. Oi, you! Follow that hearse!
 I can't do that, sir.
 Why not?
I'll tell you why not! Because this is my coach.
Well, get in, then. Move!
Yah! Come on.
 Come on.
 Everything in order, Mr Dickens?
 No!
 What did he say?
 I am not without a sense of humour...
 Dickens?
 Yes.
 Charles Dickens? The Charles Dickens?
 Shall I remove the gentleman, sir?
 You're brilliant! I've read them all.
"Great Expectations", "Oliver Twist" and the one with the ghost.
 "A Christmas Carol"?
 No. With the trains.
"The Signalman". Terrifying. The best short story ever. You're a genius.
 Shall I get rid of him, sir?
 No. He can stay.
Charles... Can I call you Charles? I'm such a fan.
 A what? A big what?
 Fan. Number one fan.
How exactly are you a fan? How do you resemble a way of keeping cool?
It means fanatic.
Mind you, the American bit in "Martin Chuzzlewit", what's that? It's rubbish.
 I thought you were my fan.
 If you can't take criticism...
Do the death of Little Nell... No, forget that. Faster!
Who exactly is in that hearse?
My friend. She's only 19. Now she's in danger.
Why are we talking about dry old books? This is much more important.
 Driver, be swift! The chase is on!
 Attaboy, Charlie.
 Nobody calls me Charlie.
 The ladies do.
 How do you know?
 I'm your...
Number one fan. Yes.
 What are we going to do with her?
 I don't know.
I didn't plan any of this. It isn't my fault if the dead won't stay dead.
Then whose fault is it, sir? Why is this happening to us?
I did the bishop a favour once 
made his nephew look like a cherub though he'd been a fortnight in the weir.
Perhaps he'll do us an exorcism on the cheap.
Say I'm not in. Just get rid of them.
 We're closed.
 Nonsense.
Undertakers don't keep office hours. The dead don't die on schedule.
 I demand to see your master.
 He's not in.
Don't lie to me, child! Summon him.
I'm sorry, Mr Dickens, but the master's indisposed.
 Having trouble with your gas?
 What the Shakespeare is going on?
Are you all right?
You're kidding me, yeah? You are kidding me, aren't you?
OK. No kidding.
 You're not allowed in, sir.
 There's something in the walls.
The gas pipes. Something's living inside the gas.
Let me out! Open the door!
 That's her.
 Please let me out!
 How dare you, sir? This is my house!
 Shut up!
I told you...
Let me out! Somebody open the door!
Open the door!
I think this is my dance.
It's a prank. We're under some mesmeric influence.
 No. The dead are walking. Hi.
 Hi. Who's your friend?
 Charles Dickens.
 OK.
I'm the Doctor. Who are you?
 Failing.
 Open the rift. We're dying.
Trapped in this form. Cannot sustain. Help us.
First you drug me, then you kidnap me 
and I felt your hands having a quick wander!
 I won't be spoken to like this!
 You put me in a room full of zombies!
 You swan off and leave me to die!
 It's not my fault! It's this house.
It always had a reputation.
Haunted. I never had much bother until three months back. Then the stiffs...
The... dear departed... started getting restless.
 Tommy-rot!
 You witnessed it.
Can't keep the beggars down, sir. They walk.
The queerest thing, they hang on to scraps...
Two sugars, sir. How you like it.
One old sexton almost went to his own memorial service.
Just like the old lady going to your performance, sir.
 Morbid fancy.
 Charles, you were there.
 I saw nothing but an illusion.
 If you're going to deny it, just shut up.
 What about the gas?
 That's new, sir. I've never seen that.
The rift's getting wider and something's getting through.
 What's a rift?
 A weak point in time and space.
A connection with another place. That's the cause of ghost stories.
That's how I got the house so cheap. Stories going back generations.
Echoes in the dark, queer songs in the air and this feeling like a shadow passing over your soul.
It's been good for business. What people expect from a gloomy old trade like mine.
Impossible.
Checking for strings?
Wires, perhaps. There must be some mechanism behind this fraud.
Oh, come on, Charles. I shouldn't have told you to shut up.
I'm sorry. You've got one of the best minds in the world.
 You saw the gas creatures.
 I cannot accept...
What does the human body do when it decomposes? It produces gas.
Perfect home for these gas things. They can use it as a vehicle.
 Just like your coach.
 Stop it.
Can it be that I have the world entirely wrong?
 Not wrong. There's just more to learn.
 I've always railed against the fantasist.
I've always loved an illusion, but that's exactly what they were  illusions.
The real world is something else.
I dedicated myself to that  injustices, the great social causes.
I hoped that I was a force for good.
Now you tell me that the real world is a realm of spectres and jack-o'-lanterns.
In which case, have I wasted my brief span here, Doctor?
Has it all been for nothing?
 Miss, you shouldn't be helping.
 Don't be daft. Sneed works you to death.
 How much do you get paid?
 Eight pound a year, miss.
 How much?
 I know. I would have been happy with six.
 So did you even go to school or what?
 Of course I did.
What do you think I am, an urchin? I went every Sunday, nice and proper.
 Once a week?
 We did sums and everything.
 To be honest, I hated every second.
 Me too.
Don't tell anyone, but one week... I didn't go and I runned on the heath on my own!
I did plenty of that. I used to go round the shops with my mate Shereen.
 We used to go and look at boys.
 I don't know much about that, miss.
Times haven't changed that much. I bet you've done the same.
 I don't think so, miss.
 Gwyneth, you can tell me.
I bet you've got your eye on someone.
I suppose... There is one lad. The butcher's boy.
He comes by every Tuesday. Such a lovely smile on him.
I like a nice smile. Good smile. Nice bum.
Well, I've never heard the like!
Ask him out. Give him a cup of tea or something. That's a start.
I swear it is the strangest thing, miss.
You've got the clothes and the breeding, but you talk like some sort of wild thing.
Maybe I am. Maybe that's a good thing.
You need a bit more in your life than Mr Sneed.
That's not fair. He's not so bad, old Sneed. He was very kind to take me in.
I lost my mum and dad to the flu when I was 12.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, miss. But I'll be with them again one day  sitting with them in paradise.
I shall be so blessed.
They're waiting for me. Maybe your dad's up there waiting for you too, miss.
Maybe.
Um... Who told you he was dead?
I don't know. Must have been the Doctor.
My father died years back.
But you've been thinking about him lately.
I suppose so. How do you know all this?
Mr Sneed says I think too much.
I'm all alone down here. I bet you've got dozens of servants, haven't you?
 No. No servants where I'm from.
 And you've come such a long way.
What makes you think so?
You're from London. I've seen London in drawings, but never like that.
All those people rushing about, half-naked. For shame.
And the noise...
And the metal boxes racing past.
And the birds in the sky... No, they're metal as well.
Metal birds with people in them. People are flying.
And you've flown so far, further than anyone.
The things you've seen.
The darkness... The Big Bad Wolf.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, miss.
 It's all right.
Ever since I was a little girl, my mam said I had the sight.
But it's getting stronger, more powerful?
All the time, sir.
Every night... voices in my head.
You grew up on top of the rift. You're part of it. You're the key.
I've tried to make sense of it, sir.
Consulted with spiritualists, table rappers, all sorts.
That should help. You can show us what to do.
 What do to where, sir?
 We're going to have a seance.
This is how Madam Mortlock summons those from the Land of Mists. Come...
 Join hands.
 I can't take part.
Humbug? Come on. Open mind.
This is precisely the sort of cheap mummery I strive to unmask.
Seances?
Nothing but luminous tambourines and a squeeze-box concealed between the knees.
 This girl knows nothing.
 Don't antagonise her.
 I love a happy medium.
 I can't believe you said that.
Come on. We might need you.
Good man. Now, Gwyneth...
Reach out.
Speak to us.
Are you there, spirits? Come.
Speak to us that we may relieve your burden.
Can you hear that?
 Nothing can happen. This is sheer folly.
 Look at her.
I see them.
I feel them.
 What's it saying?
 It can't get through.
You're controlling it. Look deep. Allow them through.
 I can't.
 You can.
Just believe it. I have faith in you, Gwyneth.
Make the link.
Yes.
Great God! Spirits from the other side.
The other side of the universe.
 Pity us.
 Pity the Gelth. There is so little time. Help us.
 What do you want us to do?
 The rift.
 Take the girl to the rift. Make a bridge.
 What for?
We are so very few  the last of our kind. We face extinction.
Why? What happened?
We had a physical form like you, but then the war came...
War? What war?
The Time War. The whole universe convulsed.
The Time War raged.
Invisible to smaller species, but devastating to higher forms.
Our bodies wasted away.
We're trapped in this gaseous state.
That's why you need the corpses.
We want to stand tall, to feel the sunlight, to live again.
We need a physical form and your dead are abandoned.
 They go to waste. Give them to us.
 But we can't.
 Why not?
 It's not... I mean, it's not...
Not decent? It could save their lives.
Open the rift. Let the Gelth through.
We're dying. Help us. Pity the Gelth.
Gwyneth?
All true.
Are you OK?
It's all true.
It's all right. You just sleep.
But my angels, miss... They came, didn't they? They need me.
 They do. You're their only chance.
 Leave her alone.
She's exhausted and she's not fighting your battles.
Drink this.
What did you say, Doctor? Explain it again. What are they?
Aliens.
 Like foreigners?
 Pretty foreign, yeah. From up there.
 Brecon?
 Close.
They want to get from Brecon to Cardiff, but the road's blocked.
Only a few get through and they're weak.
They can only test-drive the bodies for so long, then they revert to gas.
 Which is why they need the girl.
 No.
But she can help. She can open up the rift, make a bridge and let them through.
Incredible. Ghosts that are not ghosts, but beings from another world, who can only exist in our world by inhabiting cadavers.
Good system.
 You can't let them inside dead people.
 Why not? It's recycling.
 Seriously, you can't.
 Seriously, I can!
It's wrong. Those bodies were living people. We should respect them even in death.
 Do you carry a donor card?
 It's different.
Yes, it's a different morality. Get used to it or go home.
Time's short. I can't worry about a few corpses when the Gelth could be dying.
 I don't care. They're not using her.
 Don't I get a say, miss?
Look... you don't understand what's going on.
You would say that, miss, because inside your head you think I'm stupid.
 That's not fair.
 It's true, though.
Things might be different where you're from, but here and now I know my own mind and the angels need me.
 Doctor, what do I have to do?
 You don't have to do anything.
They've been singing to me since I was a child, sent by my mam on holy mission.
 So tell me.
 We need to find the rift.
This house is on a weak spot. Mr Sneed, what's the weakest part of this house?
 The place where most ghosts are seen.
 That would be the morgue.
Any chance you were going to say gazebo?
Talk about Bleak House.
Doctor, the Gelth don't succeed.
I know they don't. I know corpses weren't walking around in 1869.
Time's changing every second. Your world can be rewritten like that.
 Nothing is safe. Remember that. Nothing.
 Doctor...
I think the room is getting colder.
Here they come.
You've come to help. Praise the Doctor! Praise him!
 Promise you won't hurt her.
 Hurry. So little time. Pity the Gelth.
I'll take you somewhere else after. Somewhere you can build bodies.
This isn't a permanent solution.
My angels. I can help them live.
 Where's the weak point?
 Here. Beneath the arch.
Beneath the arch.
 You don't have to do this.
 My angels.
Establish the bridge out of the void, let us through.
Yes.
I can see you. I can see you... Come.
 Bridgehead establishing.
 Come to this world, poor lost souls.
It is begun. The bridge is made.
 She has given herself to the Gelth.
 There's rather a lot of them.
The bridge is open. We descend.
The Gelth will come through in force.
You said you were few in number.
A few billion. And all of us in need of corpses.
Oh, Gwyneth... Stop this!
Listen to your master. This has gone far enough.
Stop dabbling, child, and leave these things alone, I beg of you.
Mr Sneed!
 I think it's gone a little bit wrong.
 I have joined the legions of the Gelth.
Come. March with us.
No...
We need bodies.
All of you... dead. The human race... dead.
Gwyneth, send them back!
Three more bodies. Make them vessels for the Gelth.
Doctor, I can't... Sorry.
This new world of yours is too much for me.
I'm so...
Give yourself to glory. Sacrifice your lives to the Gelth.
 I trusted you. I pitied you.
 We don't want your pity!
 We want this world and all its flesh!
 Not while I'm alive.
Then live no more.
But I can't die. Tell me I can't.
I haven't even been born yet. It's impossible for me to die.
Isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Failing. Atmosphere hostile.
Gas... Gas!
But it's 1869. How can I die now?
Time isn't a straight line. It can twist into any shape.
You can be born in the 20th century and die in the 19th and it's my fault.
I brought you here.
It's not your fault. I wanted to come.
What about me? I saw the fall of Troy, World War Five.
I pushed boxes at the Boston Tea Party. Now I'm going to die in a dungeon...
in Cardiff!
It's not just dying... We're going to become one of them.
 We'll go down fighting, yeah?
 Yeah.
 Together?
 Yeah.
I'm so glad I met you.
Me too.
Doctor! Doctor! Turn off the flame, turn up the gas!
 Fill the room now!
 What are you doing?
Turn it all on. Flood the place!
 Brilliant. Gas.
 So we choke to death instead?
Am I correct, Doctor? These creatures are gaseous.
Fill the room with gas, it'll draw them out of the host  like poison from a wound.
I hope... Oh, Lord.
I hope that this theory will be validated soon... if not immediately.
Plenty more!
It's working.
Gwyneth! Send them back! They lied. They're not angels.
 Liars?
 Look at me.
If your mother and father could see this, they'd tell you the same.
They'd give you strength. Send them back.
 I can't breathe.
 Charles, get her out.
 I'm not leaving her!
 They're too strong.
Remember Rose's world? None of it will exist unless you send them back through the rift.
I can't send them back.
But I can hold them. Hold them in this place, hold them here.
Get out.
 You can't!
 Leave this place!
Get out! I won't leave her while she's in danger.
Leave that to me.
This way.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
 She didn't make it.
 I'm sorry. She closed the rift.
At such a cost. The poor child.
I did try, but Gwyneth was already dead.
 She had been for at least five minutes.
 What do you mean?
She was dead when she stood in that arch.
But she can't have... She spoke to us. She helped us. She saved us.
How could she have done that?
"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy." Even for you, Doctor.
She saved the world. A servant girl. No one will ever know.
Right, then, Charlie boy. I've just got to go into my... shed.
 Won't be long.
 What are you going to do now?
I shall take the mail coach back to London, post-haste.
This is no time for me to be on my own.
I shall spend Christmas with my family and make amends to them.
After all I've learned tonight, there can be nothing more vital.
 You've cheered up.
 Exceedingly.
I thought I knew everything in the world. Now I know I've just started.
All these huge and wonderful notions. I'm inspired. I must write about them.
 Do you think that's wise?
 I shall be subtle... at first.
"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood" still lacks an ending.
Perhaps the killer was not the boy's uncle.
Perhaps he was not of this earth.
"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood And The Blue Elementals".
I can spread the word, the truth.
Good luck with it. Nice to meet you. Fantastic.
Bye, then. And thanks.
Bye, then. And thanks.
Oh, my dear... How modern.
Thank you. But I don't understand...
In what way is this goodbye?
 Where are you going?
 You'll see. In the shed.
'Pon my soul, Doctor. It's one riddle after another with you.
After all these revelations, there's one mystery you still haven't explained.
Answer me this... Who are you?
Just a friend, passing through.
But you have such knowledge of future times...
I don't wish to impose on you, but I must ask you.
My books, Doctor... do they last?
Oh, yes.
 For how long?
 For ever.
Right. Shed. Come on, Rose.
In the box? Both of you?
Down, boy. See you.
Doesn't it change history if he writes about blue ghosts?
In a week it's 1870 and that's the year he dies. He'll never get to tell his story.
Oh, no. He was so nice.
In your time he was dead. We've brought him back to life.
He's more alive now than he's ever been. Let's give him one last surprise.
 Merry Christmas, sir.
 Merry Christmas to you.
God bless us, every one!
 @@@@@@
@@@@@@
 There's a strange man in my bedroom.
 No.
 Mum?
 I'm in town.
Just go home right now.
 You're breaking up.
 Mum!
Agh!
Right, then, I'll be off, unless... I don't know... You could come with me.
 Is it always dangerous?
 Yeah.
 How long have I been gone?
 About 12 hours.
I just want to see my mum.
 What will you tell her?
 That I've been to the year five billion and only been gone 12 hours?
No, I'll say I spent the night at Shareen's. See you later.
Don't you disappear.
I'm back! I was with Shareen. She was all upset again. Are you in?
So, how have you been? What's that face for? It's not the first time I've stayed out all night.
 It's you!
 Of course it's me.
Oh, my God. It's you.
Oh, my God!
It's not 12 hours, it's 12 months.
You've been gone a whole year. Sorry.
<i>The hours I've sat here,</i> <i>days and weeks and months, all on my own.</i> <i>I thought you were dead.</i> <i>And where were you? Travelling</i> What does that mean, travelling? That's no sort of answer.
You ask her. She won't tell me. Just says travelling.
 That's what I was doing.
 Your passport's here.
It's one lie after another!
I meant to phone, I really did. I just forgot.
You forgot for a year? And I am left sitting here.
I just don't believe you. Why won't you tell me where you've been?
Actually, it's my fault. I sort of employed Rose as my companion.
 Is this a sexual relationship?
 No!
Then what is it? You waltz in here, all charm and smiles.
The next thing I know, she vanishes off the face of the earth! How old are you? 40? 45?
Did you meet on the internet? Did you pretend you're a doctor?
 I AM a Doctor.
 Stitch this, mate.
Oh!
Did you think about me at all?
I did, all the time, but...
One phone call. Just to know that you were alive.
I'm sorry. I really am.
What terrifies me is that you still can't say.
What happened to you, Rose? What can be so bad that you can't tell me, sweetheart?
Where were you?
I can't tell her. I can't even begin. She's never gonna forgive me.
And I missed a year. Was it good?
 Middling.
 You're so useless.
If it's this much trouble, are you gonna stay here?
 I don't know. I can't do that to her again.
 Well, she's not coming with us.
No chance!
 I don't do families.
 She slapped you!
900 years of time and space, then slapped by your mother.
 Your face!
 It hurt!
You're so gay!
When you say 900 years...
 That's my age.
 You're 900 years old?
Yeah.
My mum was right. That is one hell of an age gap.
Every conversation with you just goes mental.
There's no one else I can talk to. I've seen all that stuff up there and I can't say a word.
Aliens and spaceships and things, and...
... I'm the only person on Planet Earth who knows they exist.
Oh, that's just not fair.
Get back.
 It's blocked off.
 We're miles from the centre.
The city must be gridlocked. London must be closing down.
I can't believe I'm here to see this. It's fantastic!
 Did you know about this?
 Nope.
 Recognise the ship?
 Nope.
 Do you know why it crashed?
 Nope.
 I'm so glad I've got you  This is why I travel 
to see history happening in front of us.
Let's go and see it. Forget the traffic. We've got the Tardis.
One spaceship's enough. I don't want to shove another one on top.
Yours is a big blue box. No one's gonna notice.
There'll be all kinds of people watching. The Tardis stays where it is.
 So history's happening and we're stuck here?
 Yes, we are.
 It's gotta be Ken Livingstone, ain't it?
 We could always do what everybody else does.
We could watch it on TV.
<i>Big Ben destroyed</i> <i>as a UFO crash-lands in Central London.</i> <i>Police reinforcements are drafted in</i> <i>to control widespread panic,</i> <i>looting and civil disturbance.</i> <i>A state of national emergency has been</i> <i>declared. Tom Hitchinson is at the scene.</i> <i>The police are urging the public not to panic.</i> <i>There's a helpline number</i> <i>if you're worried about friends or family.</i> <i>The military are on the look-out</i> <i>for spaceships.</i> <i>All flights in North American airspace</i> <i>have been grounded.</i> <i>The army is sending divers into the wrecked</i> <i>spaceship. No one knows what they'll find.</i> <i>The President will address the nation live.</i> <i>The Secretary General has asked</i> <i>that people watch the skies.</i>  I make him welcome or risk losing you.
 Your mother sobbed in my arms.
 I cradled her like a child.
 I'm trying to listen.
<i>News is just coming in.</i> <i>Now to Tom at the Embankment.</i> <i>They've found a body. It's unconfirmed,</i> <i>but I'm being told that a body</i> <i>has been found of non-terrestrial origins.</i> <i>It's being brought ashore.</i> <i>A body has been found inside the wreckage.</i> Guess who asked me out. Billy Croot!
<i><u>Unconfirmed reports say that the body</i> <i>is of extraterrestrial origin.</i> <i>An extraordinary event</i> <i>unfolding here in Central London.</i> <i>The body is being transferred to a secure unit</i> <i>mortuary, whereabouts as yet unknown.</i> <i>And when you've stuck your fins on,</i> <i>you can cover it in buttercream.</i> <i>Then ice it any colour you want.</i> <i>Here's one I made a little bit earlier</i>  <i>your very own spaceship, ready to eat.</i> <i>We still don't know if it's dead.</i> <i>Whitehall is denying everything.</i> <i>The body has been brought</i> <i>to Albion Hospital. It's the closest to the river.</i> Go on.
<i>I'm being told that General Asquith</i> <i>is now entering the hospital.</i> <i>The building's been evacuated.</i> <i>The patients have been moved onto the streets.</i> <i>The police won't confirm</i> <i>that an alien body is inside those walls.</i> Let's have a look, then.
Good God!
 That's real? It's not a hoax or a dummy or?
 I've X-rayed the skull.
It's wired up inside like nothing I've ever seen before.
No one could make this up.
We've got experts being flown in.
Until they arrive, get that out of sight.
Excuse me, sir. I know it's a state of emergency and there's a lot of rumour flying around, but is it true what they're saying about the prime minister?
<i>Mystery still surrounds</i> <i>the whereabouts of the prime minister.</i> <i>The opposition are criticising</i> <i>his lack of leadership and... Hold on.</i> <i>That's Joseph Green, MP for Hartley Dale.</i> <i>He's chairman of the parliamentary commission</i> <i>on the monitoring of sugar standards</i> <i>in exported confectionery</i> 
<i>hardly the most important person.</i> Indra Ganesh, sir, Junior secretary with the MOD. I'll be your liaison.
 Where the hell is he?
 We'll talk upstairs.
Excuse me. Harriet Jones. MP for Flydale North.
 I'm sorry. Can't it wait?
 But I did have an appointment at 3.15.
A spaceship crashed in the middle of London. I think the schedule might have changed.
 You've heard about the alien, sir?
 Never mind that.
 Where's the prime minister?
 He's disappeared.
With the Cabinet stranded outside London, that makes you acting prime minister.
Oh, Lord! Oh, hold on.
Pardon me. It's just a nervous stomach. Anyway...
Margaret Blaine. She's with Ml5.
I escorted the prime minister from the Cabinet Room to his car.
 This is Oliver Charles, transport liaison.
 The car's disappeared. It literally vanished.
Right. Inside. Tell me everything.
Er, sir...
The emergency protocols. Detailing the actions to be taken in the event of an alien incursion.
Right. Good.  Blimey!
Pardon me. Let's work, eh?
 Where are you going?
 Nowhere.
It's a bit human for me. History just happened and they're talking about cheap top-up cards.
 I'm only off on a wander.
 A spaceship landed and you're just wandering?
Nothing to do with me. It was a genuine crash-landing. Angle of descent, smoke. Perfect.
 So?
 So maybe this is it. The first contact!
Mankind officially comes into contact with an alien race.
You have to handle this on your own. The human race will finally grow up.
Just this morning, you were all tiny and small and made of clay. Now you can expand!
Celebrate history. Spend some time with your mum.
Promise you won't disappear?
Tell you what. Tardis key.
It's about time you had one. See you later.
Oi, gorgeous! Join the party!
Oh, my God!
Wait, Doctor!
Doctor!
I bet no one's brought you a coffee.
 Thank you.
 Pleasure.
You still can't go in.
Damn. You've seen through my cunning plan.
 I'm sorry. It's just impossible.
 Not even for two minutes?
I don't often walk these corridors. I'm not a babe, just a faithful backbencher.
I know we've had a brave new world land on our doorstep, and that's wonderful.
Probably wonderful.
Nevertheless, ordinary life keeps ticking away.
I need to enter this paper.
Mr Green, sir, I know you're busy, but could you put this on the next Cabinet agenda?
 What is it?
 Cottage hospitals.
I've worked out a system whereby they do not have to be excluded from centres of excellence.
My mother's in the Flydale Infirmary. That's my constituency. Tiny place.
By all the saints, get some perspective, woman!
I'm busy!
Shh!
Agh!
Defence Plan Delta! Come on, move!
 It's alive!
 Spread out. Tell the perimeter it's a lockdown.
 My God. It's still alive!
 Do it!
Mick! Terry! Side rooms, now!
 Clear!
 Front clear!
 Keep it moving!
 Clear!
 I swear it was dead.
 Coma, shock, hibernation.
What does it look like?
It's still here.
Hello!
Don't shoot!
What did you do that for?
It was scared!
It was scared!
I've got the White House phoning me because Downing Street won't answer their calls.
We haven't even started the vaccination programme!
 The nations of the world are watching us!
 Well, it has been a bit of a shock.
This is the greatest crisis in modern history and you've done nothing.
You're in charge. We need positive leadership.
The capital's ground to a halt.
We assume that the prime minister's disappearance is the result of hostile alien action.
And what have you been doing? Nothing!
Sorry. I thought I was prime minister now.
 Only by default.
 Oh, that's not fair! I've been having such fun.
You think this is fun?
It's a hoot, this job.
Honestly, it's super!
Oh, excuse me!
Oh!
What's going on here?
 Why hasn't the Cabinet been airlifted in?
 I cancelled it.
They'd only get in the way.
Oh! There I go.
And me!
I'm shaking my booty!
Sir, under section five of the emergency protocols, it is my duty to relieve you of command.
I'll put this country under martial law if I have to.
Oh, I'm scared I mean, that's hair-raising.
I mean, literally.
Look!
I assumed that's what aliens looked like, but you're saying it's a pig from Earth.
More like a mermaid. Victorian showmen used to draw the crowds by gluing the skull of a cat to a fish and calling it a mermaid.
Now someone's taken a pig, opened up its brain, stuck bits on, put it in that ship and made it dive-bomb. It must have been terrified.
They've taken this animal and turned it into a joke.
So it's a fake. A pretend, like the mermaid.
But the technology augmenting its brain is like nothing on Earth.
It's alien. Aliens are faking aliens.
Why would they do that?
Doctor?
Doctor?
 Here's to the Martians!
 To the Martians!
 I was gonna come and see you.
 Someone owes Mickey an apology.
 I'm sorry.
 Not you.
It's not my fault. Be fair, what was I supposed to think?
You disappear, who do they turn to?
Five times I was taken in for questioning. Five times. No evidence!
Then I get her whispering around the estate, pointing the finger. Stuff through my letter box.
 I didn't think I'd be gone so long.
 I waited for you.
 12 months, waiting for you and the Doctor.
 You knew about the Doctor?
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah, why not, Rose?
 How could I tell her where you went?
 Tell me now.
I might as well 'cause you're stuck here.
 The Doctor's gone. That box thing faded away.
 What do you mean?
He's left you. Some boyfriend he turned out to be!
 He wouldn't just go. He promised me.
 He's dumped you. Sailed off into space.
How does it feel? Now you are left behind with the rest of us earthlings. Get used to it.
 He would have said.
 What are you going on about?
 What's this Doctor done now?
 He's vamoosed!
He's not, 'cause he gave me this.
He's not my boyfriend. He's better than that. He's much more important...
I said so.
Mum, go inside. Don't stand there. Just go inside. Mum...
Oh, blimey.
Huh?
How did you do that, then?
All right, so I lied. I had a look.
The whole crash-landing's a fake. I thought so. I mean, hitting Big Ben  come on!
 My mum's here.
 Oh, that's just what I need Don't make this place domestic.
 You ruined my life, Doctor.
 I was a murder suspect because of you.
 See? Domestic!
 I bet you don't even remember my name!
 Ricky.
 It's Mickey. I think I know my own name.
 You think you know? How stupid are you?
 Mum! Don't go anywhere. Don't fight.
Mum, it's not like that. He's not...
I'll be up in a minute. Hold on.
 That was a real spaceship?
 Yep.
What is it, then? Are they invading?
Funny way to invade  putting the world on red alert.
Good point. So what are they up to?
<i>As the government shows a remarkable</i> <i>lack of leadership, paranoia sweeps the country.</i> <i>There's been three reports of assaults</i> <i>on people falsely identified as aliens.</i> <i>Now back to Tom Hitchinson.</i> <i>Are there more ships to come?</i> <i>And what is their intention?</i> <i>The authorities want your help.</i> <i>If any previous sighting has been made,</i> <i>then call this number.</i> <i>We need your help.</i> Yes. I've seen one  an alien  and she's with him. My daughter, she's with him.
And she's not safe. Oh, my God. She's not safe.
I've seen an alien. I know his name. He's called the Doctor.
It's a box. A blue box.
She called it a Tardis.
What are you doing?
 Ricky...
 Mickey.
Ricky.
If I told you what I was doing to the controls of my magnificent ship, would you understand?
 I suppose not.
 Well, shut it, then.
 Some friend you've got  He's winding you up.
 I AM sorry.
 OK.
I am, though.
Every day I looked.
On every street corner. Looking for a blue box for a whole year.
It's only been a few days for me.
I don't know. It's hard to tell inside this thing, but I swear, it's just a few days since I left.
Not enough time to miss me, then.
I did miss you.
I missed you.
So, um...
In 12 months, have you been seeing anyone else?
 No.
 OK.
 Mainly 'cause everyone thinks I murdered you.
 Right.
So... now that you've come back...
... are you gonna stay?
Got it! Ha-ha!
Patched in the radar. Looped it back 12 hours so it followed the flight of that spaceship.
Come on!
That's the spaceship on its way to Earth.
Except... Hold on...
The spaceship did a slingshot round the Earth before it landed.
It came from Earth in the first place. It went up and came back down.
Those aliens have been here for a while. The question is, what have they been doing?
What do you think? How's the compression?
I've got too much ballast round the middle.
Oh! That's better.
 We've got to fix the gas exchange.
 It seems very human to me.
 We'd better get rid of his skin.
 Shame. I quite enjoyed being Oliver.
He had a wife, a mistress and a young farmer.
God, I was busy!
Back to work!
 I have an army to command.
 Careful. We're not there yet.
General Asquith! We've had a priority alarm. It's Code Nine confirmed.
Code Nine? Which would mean?
In the event of the emergency protocols being activated, our software searches communications for key words, including "Doctor".
 I think we've found him, sir.
 What sort of doctor? Who is he?
He's an expert in extraterrestrial affairs. The ultimate expert.
We need him, sir. We need him here right now.
 How many channels do you get?
 The basic packages.
 Do you get sports channels?
 Yes, I get the football. I know that lot.
<i>The Government's</i> <i>bringing in alien specialists</i> <i>who have devoted their lives</i> <i>to studying outer space.</i> UNIT  United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.
 How do you know 'em?
 He's worked for them.
I didn't sit on my backside for 12 months. I read up on you.
Look deep enough on the internet and there's his name,  followed by a list of the dead.
 Good boy, Ricky!
 If you know 'em, why don't you go and help?
 They wouldn't recognise me.
Besides, there's aliens out there and fake aliens. I want to keep THIS alien out of the mix.
I'm going undercover. Better keep the Tardis out of sight.
 Ricky, you've got a car. You can drive.
 Where to?
Let's go and look at that spaceship.
<i>Do not move</i> Rose!
Rose!
<i>Raise your hands above your head.</i> Take me to your leader This is posh. If I'd known being arrested was like this, I'd have done it years ago.
 We're being escorted, not arrested.
 Where to?
Downing Street!
 You're kidding!
 I'm not.
 10 Downing Street?
 That's the one.
My God! I'm going to 10 Downing Street.
 How come?
 Mickey was right.
I've visited this planet a lot of times  and I've been noticed.
 Now they need you?
They're gathering experts in alien knowledge. Who's the biggest expert?
 Patrick Moore?
 Apart from him.
Don't you just love it!
Lloyd George used to drink me under the table.
 Who's the prime minister now?
 I don't know. I missed a year.
Oh, my God.
 She's all right, then? She's not in any trouble?
 Your daughter and her companion might be in a position to help the country.
We need to know how she made contact with this man  if he is a man.
Ooh.
Off you go. I need to talk with Mrs Tyler on my own, thank you.
Harriet Jones, MP Flydale North.
Ladies and gentlemen, can we convene? Quick as we can, please.
Can I remind you, ID cards must be worn at all times.
Here's your ID card.
 Your companion doesn't have clearance.
 I don't go anywhere without her.
 I'm sorry, Doctor. She'll have to stay outside.
 She's staying with me.
 Even I don't have clearance to go in there.
 It's all right. You go.
 Are you the Doctor?
 Not now. We're busy. Can't you go home?
 I just need a word.
 You haven't got clearance.
 I'll have to leave you with security.
 It's all right. I'll look after her.
Let me be of some use.
Walk with me. Just keep walking.
That's right.
Don't look round. Harriet Jones, MP Flydale North.
This friend of yours...
he's an expert, is that right?
 He knows about aliens.
 Why do you wanna know?
If I could have your attention, please. As you can see, the ship had one porcine pilot.
The really interesting bit happened three days ago, filed in Any Other Business.
The North Sea, a satellite detected a signal, a blip of radiation, at 100 fathoms...
like there's something down there.
You were about to investigate, then came the spaceship  a massive diversion. From what?
They turned the body into a suit  a disguise for the thing inside.
It's all right. I believe you.
It's alien.
They must have some serious technology behind this. If we could find it, we could use it.
 Oh, my God!
 This has gone beyond a joke.
You cannot just wander...
Oh, my God!
That's the prime minister!
If aliens fake an alien crash and an alien pilot, what do they get?
Us.
They get us.
It's not a diversion, it's a trap.
Oh...
Has someone been naughty?
It was bigger on the inside. I don't know. What do I know about spaceships?
That's what worries me. This man is classified as trouble, which means that anyone associated with him is trouble.
And that's my job...
eliminating trouble.
That's not possible.
He left this afternoon.
 The prime minister left. He was driven away.
 And who told you that?
Hmm?
Me!
This is all about us. Experts with the knowledge how to fight aliens, together in one room.
Do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world?
Would you rather silent but deadly?
Ohhh!
We are the Slitheen.
Agh!
Thank you all for wearing your ID cards.
They'll help to identify the bodies.
Agh!
Agh!  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
Those aliens have been here for a while.
Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North.
I thought I was prime minister now.
Agh!
Thank you all for wearing your ID cards.
They'll help to identify the bodies.
Deadly to humans, maybe.
Jackie!
Oi! If you want aliens, they're inside Downing Street. Come on!
 Reinstate my disguise.
 Hurry up. Hurry!
No, wait. They're still in there  the emergency protocols. We need them.
Agh!
Where have you been?
I called for help. I sounded the alarm.
There was this lightning, this kind of electricity, and they all collapsed.
 I think they're all dead.
 That's what I'm saying!
He did it. That man there!
I think you'll find the prime minister is an alien in disguise.
 That's never gonna work, is it?
 No.
Fair enough.
Down there!
Under the jurisdiction of the emergency protocols, I authorise you to execute this man!
Well, now... You see, the thing is...
If I was gonna execute someone by backing them against a wall, a little word of advice...
Don't stand them against the lift!
Hello.
Hide!
I repeat, the upper floors are under quarantine.
You will stay where you are and you will take your orders directly from me.
Mr Green, sir, sorry, but you've got to come with me.
 We should evacuate the entire building.
 Sergeant...
 Have you read the emergency protocols?
 No, sir.
Then don't question me.
Seal off Number 10, secure the ground floor, and if the Doctor makes it downstairs, shoot on sight!
Well, you heard him. Move out!
Let the sport begin.
I'm getting poisoned by the gas exchange.
 I need to be naked.
 Rejoice in it.
Your body is magnificent!
Oh, such fun!
Little human children! Where are you?
Sweet little humeykins.
Come to me. Let me kiss you better.
Kiss you with my big green lips.
It does us good to hunt.
Purifies the blood.
We'll keep this floor quarantined as our last hiding ground before the final phase.
My brothers!
 Happy hunting?
 It's wonderful!
The more you prolong it, the more they stink!
Sweat and fear.
I can smell an old girl.
Stale perfume and brittle bones.
 And a ripe youngster.
 All hormones and adrenalin.
 Fresh enough to bend before she snaps!
 Agh!
No! Take me first!
Take me!
Out! With me!
 Who are you?
 Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North.
 Nice to meet you.
 Likewise.
 Head for the Cabinet Rooms.
 The emergency protocols are in there.
 I like you.
 I like you, too.
Move and I will triplicate the flammability of this alcohol. We all go up, so back off.
Right, then. Question time. Who are the Slitheen?
 They're aliens.
 I got that.
 Who are you if not human?
 Who's not human?
 He's not.
 He's not human?
 Hush! What's the plan?
 But he's got a northern accent.
 Lots of planets have a north.
 Hush!
Come on! You have a spaceship in the North Sea transmitting a signal.
You took over the government. What for, invasion?
Why would we invade this godforsaken rock?
 Something's brought the Slitheen race here.
 The Slitheen race? Slitheen is not our species.
Slitheen is our surname.
Jocrassa Fel Fotch Pasameer-Day-Slitheen at your service.
 So you're family?
 A family business.
Then you're out to make a profit. How can you do that on a godforsaken rock?
Er, excuse me. Your device will do what? Triplicate the flammability?
 Yes.
 You're making it up!
Oh, well, nice try. Harriet, have a drink. You're gonna need it.
 You pass it to the left first.
 Sorry.
 Thanks.
 Now we can end this hunt.
With a slaughter.
Don't you think we should run?
Fascinating history, Downing Street. 2,000 years ago, this was marshland.
1730, it was occupied by a Mr Chicken. He was a nice man. 1796, this was the Cabinet Room.
If the Cabinet's in session and in danger, these are the four safest walls in Britain.
End of lesson.
Installed in 1991. Three inches of steel lining every wall.
 They'll never get in.
 And how do we get out?
Ah.
He's safely contained. Cut off communications inside that room, then summon the family.
It's time we finished with this insane planet for good.
There's still no word from inside Downing Street, though we are getting even more new arrivals.
Group Captain Tennant James of the RAF, though why he's been summoned we've no idea.
Ewan McAllister, Deputy Secretary for the Scottish Parliament.
And this is most unusual.
I'm told that is Sylvia Dillane, chairman of the North Sea Boating Club.
Quite what connects all these people, we have no idea.
Group Captain. Delighted you could make it. We're meeting upstairs.
That's the spirit! Off you go.
Good to see you.
Come on through.
Ah, Sergeant, now that the Doctor's been neutralised, the upper levels are out of bounds to everyone.
 Then who are they?
 Need to know, Sergeant.
I want you to liaise with Communications.
The acting prime minister will make a public address to the nations of the world.
There you are. If you'd just like to go through and get changed.
If you'd like to head down to the end of the corridor, it's first on the left.
Thank you.
 Got anything stronger?
 No chance. This ain't the time for a conga.
 We've got to tell someone.
 Who do we trust?
For all we know, they've all got big bog monsters inside of 'em.
This is what he does, that Doctor  everywhere he goes, death and destruction.
 And Rose is in the middle of it.
 Has he got a green thing inside him, then?
I wouldn't put it past him, but he's the only person who knows how to fight these things.
I thought I was gonna die.
Come on. If anyone's gonna cry, it's gonna be me. You're safe in my flat.
No one will look for you here since you hate me so much.
You saved my life.
God, that's embarrassing!
You're telling me!
He wanted me dead.
And he's still out there, Mickey.
That policeman.
That thing.
Right, you head off. Inform Control I have one or two things that still need doing.
I haven't quite finished with Mrs Tyler yet.
 Is that all of us?
 All the family except Sip Fel Fotch.
 He's found a hunt of his own.
 Ah!
 What was his name?
 Who?
This one. The secretary or whatever he was called.
I don't know. I talked to him. I brought him a cup of coffee. I never asked his name.
Sorry.
 Right. What have we got? Any terminals?
 No. This place is antique!
Why didn't they use the prime minister as a disguise?
He's too slim. They're big. They need to fit inside big humans.
They're about eight feet. How do they squeeze inside?
The compression field around their necks shrinks them. That's why there's all that gas.
It's a big exchange.
Wish I had a compression field to make me smaller!
 This is not the time for making jokes.
 Sorry.
You get used to this if you're friends with him.
 That's a strange friendship.
 Harriet Jones. I've heard that name before.
 You're not famous, are you?
 Hardly!
 It rings a bell. Harriet Jones.
 Lifelong backbencher, I'm afraid.
The protocols are redundant. The people they list are all dead downstairs.
Hasn't it got defence codes? Couldn't we launch a nuclear bomb at them?
 You're very violent.
 I'm serious. We could.
There's nothing like that in here. Nuclear strikes do need a release code, but it's kept by the UN.
Say that again.
 What?
 Anything. All.
Well, the British Isles can't gain access to atomic weapons without a special UN resolution.
 Like that's ever stopped them!
 Exactly. I voted against that, thank you.
The codes have been given to the UN. Is it important?
 Everything is.
 If we only knew what the Slitheen wanted.
 I'm saying Slitheen as if it's normal!
 What DO they want?
They're just one family, so it's not an invasion.
They're out to make money, so they want to use something.
 Something here on Earth. A kind of asset.
 What? Gold? Oil? Water?
You're very good at this.
 Thank you.
 Harriet Jones. Why do I know that name?
How did you get a signal?
 He zapped it. Superphone.
 Phone for help. You must have contacts.
Dead downstairs, yeah.
 It's Mickey.
 Tell your stupid boyfriend we're busy.
He's not so stupid after all.
Not just alien, but, like, proper alien. All stinking and wet and disgusting.
 And it wanted to kill us.
 I could have died!
Is she all right, though? Just tell me.
 Ricky, shut up and go to your computer.
 It's Mickey, and why should I?
Mickey the idiot, I might just choke before I finish this sentence, but I need you.
It says password.
 Say it again. <i>- It's asking for the password.</i> Buffalo. Two F's, one L.
What's that website?
All the secret information known to mankind. They've known about aliens for years.
 <i>They've kept us in the dark.</i>  You were born in the dark!
 <i>Leave him alone.</i>   Thank you. Password.
Just repeat it every time.
 Why did the Slitheen hit Big Ben?
 You said to gather the experts, to kill them.
That lot would have gathered for a weather balloon.
The Slitheen are hiding, but then they put the planet on red alert. Why?
 Oh, listen to her!
 At least I'm trying.
Well, I've got a question. Since that man walked into our lives, I've been attacked in the streets, had creatures from the pits of hell in my living room, and had my daughter disappear.
 I told you what happened.
 I'm talking to him!
I've seen this life of yours, Doctor. Maybe you get off on it and think it's clever and smart, but just answer me this.
Is my daughter safe?
I'm fine.
<i>Is she safe?</i> Will she always be safe?
Can you promise me that?
<i>Well, what's the answer?</i> We're in.
On the left at the top, there's an icon  little concentric circles. Click on that.
 What is it?
 A signal from a Slitheen spaceship.
 Let me work out what it says.
 He'll have to answer me one day.
 It's a message.
 Saying what?
I don't know.
That's not me. Go and see who that is.
 It's three o'clock in the morning.
 Well, go and tell them that.
It's beaming out into space. Who's it for?
All right!
Mrs Tyler!
 It's the thing! It's the Slipeen!
 They've found us.
 Mickey, I need that signal.
 Mum, just get out! Get out!
We can't. It's by the front door.
 Oh, my God. It's unmasking.
 It's gonna kill us.
There must be a way to stop them!
 You're the expert. Think of something!
 I'm trying!
I'll take it on, Jackie. You just run.
Don't look back. Just run.
That's my mother.
We'll find their weakness once we know where they're from.
Their basic shape narrows it down to 5,000 planets. What else do we know about them?
 Green. Good sense of smell.
 Narrows it down.
 They can smell adrenalin.
 The pig technology.
 They use a slipstream engine.
 Narrows it down.
It's getting in!
 They hunt like it's a ritual.
 Narrows it down.
When they fart, if you'll pardon the word, it doesn't just smell like a fart, if you'll pardon the word, it's more like...
 Bad breath.
 That's it!
Calcium decay! Now, that narrows it down.
 We're getting there, Mum!
 Too late!
Calcium phosphate. Organic calcium. Creatures made out of living calcium.
Hyphenated surname. That narrows it down to one planet.
 Raxacoricofallapatorius!
 Great. We can write 'em a letter Get into the kitchen.
 It's gonna rip us apart!
 Calcium, weakened by the compression field.
Acetic acid. Vinegar!
 Just like Hannibal!
 Got any vinegar?
 How should I know?
 Cupboard by the sink.
 What do you need? <i>- Anything with vinegar.</i> Gherkins!
Yeah! Pickled onions!
Pickled eggs!
And you kiss this man?
Hannibal?
Hannibal crossed the Alps by dissolving boulders with vinegar.
Oh... Well, there you go, then.
He's dead. Sip Fel Fotch Pasameer-Day-Slitheen is dead.
I felt it. How could that happen?
Somebody must have got lucky.
That's the last piece of luck anyone on this rock will ever have.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Nations of the world...
Humankind...
The greatest experts in extraterrestrial events came here tonight.
They gathered in the common cause, but the news I bring you now is grave indeed.
<i>The experts are dead,</i> <i>murdered right in front of me by alien hands.</i> <i>Peoples of the Earth, heed my words.</i> <i>These visitors do not come in peace.</i> Listen to this.
<i>Our inspectors have searched the sky</i> <i>above our heads,</i> and they have found massive weapons of destruction  <i>capable of being deployed within 45 seconds.</i>  What?
Our technicians can baffle the alien probes, but not for long.
<i>We are facing extinction</i> <i>unless we strike first.</i> <i>The United Kingdom stands</i> <i>directly beneath the belly of the mother ship.</i> I beg of the United Nations, pass an emergency resolution.
Give us the access codes.
A nuclear strike at the heart of the beast is our only chance of survival because...
from this moment on...
it is my solemn duty to inform you...
... Planet Earth is at war.
 There's no weapons. He's invented it.
 Do you think they'll believe him?
 They did last time.
 The Slitheen want the whole world panicking.
 They want you to lash out.
 Release the codes...
 And the Slitheen go nuclear.
 But why?
You get the codes, release the missiles  but not into space 'cause there's nothing there.
You attack every other country on Earth. World War Three. Whole planet gets nuked.
And we'll sit through it in our spaceship in the Thames. Not crashed, just parked.
Only two minutes away!
But you'll destroy this beautiful place. What for?
Profit. The signal beaming into space is an advert.
The sale of the century. We reduce the Earth to molten slag, then sell it piece by piece.
Radioactive chunks, capable of powering every cut-price starliner and budget cargo ship.
There's a recession up there. People are buying cheap.
 This rock becomes raw fuel.
 At the cost of five billion lives.
Bargain I give you a choice  leave this planet or I'll stop you.
What?
You?
Trapped in your box?
Yes. Me.
Yesterday saw the start of a brave new world.
Today might see it end.
The streets are deserted.
Everyone's home, just waiting as the future is decided in New York.
<i>- It's midnight in New York.</i>  <i>- The United Nations has gathered.</i> <i>England has provided them with proof that</i> <i>the massive weapons of destruction do exist.</i> <i>The Security Council will be making a resolution</i> <i>in a matter of minutes,</i> <i>and once the codes are released,</i> <i>humanity's first interplanetary war begins.</i> Sergeant...
We'll take the call in the prime minister's office.
Maintain your positions.
Good luck.
Look at that! The telephone is actually red!
Oh!
 How long till they phone?
 Counting down...
I'm not saying I trust you, but there must be something you can do.
If we fermented the port, we'd make acetic acid.
Mickey, any luck?
 <i>Everyone's on voicemail.</i>  Voicemail dooms us all.
 We have to get out of here.
 There is a way.
 What?
 There's always been a way out.
 Then why don't we use it?
 Because I can't guarantee Rose's safety.
Don't you dare! Whatever it is, don't you dare!
If I don't dare, everyone dies.
Do it.
You don't even know what it is. You'd just let me?
Yeah.
Please. She's my daughter. She's just a kid.
Do you think I don't know that? This is my life. It's not fun or smart.
It's standing up and making a decision because nobody else will.
Then what are you waiting for?
I could save the world but lose you.
Except it's not your decision, Doctor.
 It's mine.
 And who the hell are you?
Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North.
The only elected representative in this room, chosen by the people for the people.
On behalf of the people, I command you... do it.
Victory... should be naked!
 How do we get out?
 We don't. We stay here.
The Council is voting. The results should be known any second now.
Use the "Buffalo" password. It overrides everything.
What are you doing?
Hacking into the Royal Navy. We're in. Here it is  HMS Taurean, Trafalgar Class submarine, ten miles off the coast of Plymouth.
 <i>Select a missile.</i>   We can't go nuclear. We don't have the codes.
All we need is an ordinary missile. What's the first category?
 Sub Harpoon, UGM-84A.
 That's the one. Select.
I could stop you.
 Do it, then. <i>- Are you ready for this?</i> Yeah.
Mickey the idiot, the world is in your hands.
<i>Fire.</i> Oh, my God!
How solid are these?
Not solid enough. Built for short-range attack. Nothing this big.
Now I'M making the decision. I'm not gonna die.
We're gonna ride this one out. You can survive earthquakes by standing under a door frame.
This cupboard's small, so it's strong. Come and help me.
The vote is in.
The Council says...
Yes. They are releasing the codes.
Ring, damn you!
It's on radar. Counter the defence 556.
 Stop them intercepting it.
 I'm doing it now.
<i>556 neutralised.</i> What do you mean, incoming?
Everybody out! Now!
What the hell is that for?
Sir, there's a missile...
Sorry.
 That's mine! You've got mine!
 Disguise me!
You're the blonde. I want the other one.
Take it off!
Everybody run!
Here we go.
Nice knowing you both.
Hannibal!
Oh, boll...
Made in Britain!
 Are you all right?
 Harriet Jones. MP Flydale North.
Contact the UN. Tell the ambassadors the crisis is over. They can step down.
Go on. Tell the news. Someone's got a hell of a job sorting this lot out!
 We haven't even got a prime minister!
 Maybe you should have a go.
Me? I'm only a backbencher.
 I'd vote for you.
 Now, don't be silly.
I'd better go and see if I can help. Hang on!
We're safe!
The Earth is safe!
Sergeant!
I thought I knew the name.
Harriet Jones.
Future prime minister. Elected for three successive terms.
 The architect of Britain's Golden Age.
 The crisis has passed!
Ladies and gentlemen, I have something to say to you all here today.
Mankind stands tall, proud and undefeated.
God bless the human race!
<i>Mankind stands tall...</i>  Harriet Jones!
 Who does she think she is?
Look at her taking all the credit. It should be you on there. My daughter saved the world!
I think the Doctor helped a bit.
All right, then. Him too.
 You should be given knighthoods.
 It's not the way he does things.
No fuss. He just moves on. He's not that bad if you gave him a chance.
He's good in a crisis, I'll give him that.
Oh, now the world HAS changed  you're being nice about him!
I've got no choice. I can't get rid of him. You're infatuated.
I'm not infatuated.
 What does he eat?
 How do you mean?
I was going to do shepherd's pie. All of us. A proper sit-down...
...'cause... I'm ready to listen.
I want to learn about you and him and that life you lead.
He's an alien. For all I know, he eats grass and safety pins and things.
He'll have shepherd's pie. You're gonna cook for him?
 What's wrong with that?
 He's finally met his match.
You're not too old for a slap, you know!
You can visit your gran tomorrow.
I told her you were in France. Said you were au-pairing.
Hello?
 Right. Two hours, then we can go.
 You've got a phone?
You think I can travel through time and I haven't got a phone? Huh!
I've just got to send out this dispersal. There you go.
That cancels out the Slitheen advert in case any bargain hunters turn up.
My mother's cooking.
 Put her on a slow heat and let her simmer. <i>- She's cooking tea.</i>  I don't do that.
 She wants to get to know you.
 I'm busy.
 It's just tea.
Not to me, it isn't.
 She's my mother.
 She's not mine.
 That's not fair.
 You can stay there if you want.
A plasma storm's brewing in the Horsehead Nebula.
Fires are burning ten million miles wide.
I could fly the Tardis right into it and ride the shock wave all the way out.
Hurtle right across the sky and end up anywhere.
Your choice.
Rose, I was thinking...
I've got that bottle of Amaretto from New Year's Eve. Does he drink?
 I was wondering whether he drinks or not.
 Yeah, he does.
Don't go, sweetheart.
Please don't go.
Good lad. Graffiti that again and I'll have you. Now, beat it!
I just went down the shop and I was thinking, "The whole world's changed." Aliens and spaceships, all in public.
And here it is.
How could they do that? They saw it.
You're happy to believe in something invisible, but if it's staring you in the face, you can't see it.
There's a scientific explanation for that  you're thick.
We're just idiots.
 Well, not all of you.
 Yeah?
That's a virus. Put it online. It'll destroy every mention of me.
 I'll cease to exist.
 What do you want to do that for?
You're right, I am dangerous. I don't want anybody following me.
 How can you say that, then take her with you?
 You could look after her. Come with us.
I can't.
This life of yours, it's just too much. I couldn't do it.
Don't tell her I said that.
I'll get a job. I'll work weekends. I'll pass my test. If Jim comes round again, I'll say no.
I'm not leaving 'cause of you. I'm just travelling.
 But it's not safe.
 Mum, if you saw it out there, you'd never stay home.
Got enough stuff The first time I stepped in there, it was spur-of-the-moment. Now I'm signing up.
You're stuck with me. Hah!
 Come with us. There's room.
 No chance.
 He's a liability.
 We'd be dead without him.
My decision is final.
Sorry.
Good luck.
You still can't promise me. What if she gets lost?
What if something happens to you and she's left on some moon a million light years away?
 How long do I wait then?
 Mum...
It's a time machine.
I could travel around suns and planets and all the way out to the edge of the universe, and by the time I get back, ten seconds would have passed. Ten seconds.
So stop worrying.
See you in ten seconds' time, yeah?
Ten seconds.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
 What is it?
 Some kind of signal, drawing us off course.
 Where are we?
 Earth. Utah, North America.
About half a mile underground.
When are we?
2012.
God, that's so close. So I should be 26.
Blimey! It's a great big museum.
An alien museum.
Someone's got a hobby.
They must have spent a fortune.
Chunks of meteorite. Moondust. The mileometer from the Roswell spaceship.
 That's a bit of Slitheen.
 That's a Slitheen's arm. It's been stuffed!
Oh! Look at you.
What is it?
An old friend of mine  well, enemy.
The stuff of nightmares, reduced to an exhibit.
I'm getting old.
 Is that where the signal's coming from?
 No. It's dead. The signal's alive.
Something's reaching out, calling for help.
If someone collects aliens, then you're Exhibit A.
<i>- Attention, all personnel.</i>  <i>- Bad Wolf One descending.</i> I wanna wish you a very happy birthday, sir.
 The president conveys his best wishes.
 He's ten points down.
 I want him replaced.
 I don't think that's very wise, sir.
You're fired.
Wipe his memory. Put him on the road. Memphis. Minneapolis.
A place beginning with M. So, the next president  Republican or Democrat?
 Democrat, sir.
 Why?
They're just so funny, sir?
 What is your name?
 Goddard, sir. Diana Goddard.
 I like you. So where's the English kid?
 Sir!
 I bought ten more artefacts at auction.
 Let me see 'em.
There's something more urgent. We arrested two intruders 53 floors down.
 We don't know how they got in.
 In-thru-da window.
In-thru-da window! That's funny!
Bring 'em in, and tell Simmons I want to visit my little pet.
Simmons, you'd better give me good news. Is it talking?
Not exactly talking, no.
 Then what's it doing?
 Screaming. Is that any good?
And this is the last.
 Paid $800,000 for it.
 What does it do?
See the tubes on the side? It must be to channel something  maybe fuel.
 I wouldn't hold it like that.
 Shut it.
 Really. That's wrong.
 Is it dangerous?
No. It just looks silly.
You just need to be...
... delicate.
It's a musical instrument!
 And it's a long way from home.
 Here, let me.
I did say delicate.
It reacts to the smallest fingerprint. It needs precision.
Very good. Quite the expert.
As are you.
Who are you?
 The Doctor. Who are you?
 Like you don't know This is the most valuable collection of extraterrestrial artefacts in the world, and you just stumbled in by mistake  Pretty much sums me up, yeah.
 How did you get in?
53 floors down. With your little cat burglar accomplice.
 She's rather pretty.
 She's gonna smack you if you call her "she"!
She's English! Hey, Little Lord Fauntleroy! Got you a girlfriend.
 This is Mr Henry Van Statten.
 And who's he when he's at home?
 Mr Van Statten owns the internet.
 No one OWNS the internet.
 Let's keep the whole world thinking that way.
 So you're an expert in everything?
Anything you don't understand, you lock up.
 You claim greater knowledge?
 I don't need to.
And yet I captured you  right next to the Cage. What were you doing down there?
 You tell me.
 The Cage contains my one living specimen.
 And what's that? Show me.
 You want to see it?
Blimey! You can smell the testosterone.
Goddard, inform the Cage we're heading down.
You, English, look after the girl. Go and canoodle or spoon or whatever it is you do.
You, Doctor-With-No-Name, come and see my pet.
We've tried everything.
The creature has shielded itself, but there's definite signs of life inside.
Inside? Inside what?
I've had to take the power down. The Metaltron is resting.
 Metaltron?
 Thought of it myself.
Good, isn't it? Although I'd prefer to know its real name.
Put these on. The last guy that touched it...
... burst into flames.
I won't touch it, then.
Go ahead, Doctor. Impress me.
Don't open that door until we get a result.
I'm sorry about this. Mr Van Statten might think he's clever, but never mind him.
I've come to help. I'm the Doctor.
Doctor?
 Impossible!
 THE Doctor?!
Exterminate!
 Exterminate!
 Let me out!
 Exterminate!
 It's going to kill him.
 It's talking!
 You are an enemy of the Daleks.
You must be destroyed!
It's not working!
Fantastic!
Oh, fantastic!
Powerless. Look at you.
 The great space dustbin  How does it feel?
 Keep back!
What for? What are you gonna do to me?
If you can't kill, then what are you good for, Dalek?
What's the point of you?
You're nothing!
What the hell are you here for?
I am waiting for orders.
 What does that mean?
 I am a soldier.
I was bred to receive orders.
 Well, you're never gonna get any. Not ever.
 I demand orders!
They're never gonna come. Your race is dead. You all burnt. Ten million ships on fire.
The entire Dalek race, wiped out in one second.
You lie!
 I watched it happen. I MADE it happen!
 You destroyed us?
I had no choice.
And what of the Time Lords?
Dead.
They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War.
Everyone lost.
And the coward survived.
Oh, and I caught your little signal.
"Help me!" Poor little thing But there's no one else coming 'cause there's no one else left.
I am alone in the universe.
Yep!
So are you.
We are the same.
We're not the same! I'm not...
No, wait.
Maybe we are.
You're right. Yeah, OK. You've got a point.
'Cause I know what to do.
I know what should happen. I know what you deserve.
Exterminate!
 Have pity!
 Why should I? You never did!
Get him out!
Help me!
 I saved your life.
 Now talk to me.
 Talk to me!
 You've got to destroy it!
The last in the universe.
And now I know your name.
Dalek.
Speak to me, Dalek!
I am Henry Van Statten. Now recognise me!
Make it talk again, Simmons.
Whatever it takes.
Sorry about the mess.
Mr Van Statten lets me do my own thing so long as I deliver the goods.
What do you think that is?
 A lump of metal?
 Yeah...
I think  well, I'm almost certain  it's from the hull of a spacecraft.
The thing is, it's all true. Everything the United Nations tries to keep quiet 
spacecraft, aliens, visitors to Earth.
 They really exist.
 That's amazing.
It sounds incredible, but I believe the whole universe is teeming with life.
I'm gobsmacked, yeah.
 And you do what? Sit here and catalogue it?
 Best job in the world!
Imagine if you could get out there  travel amongst the stars and see it for real.
I'd give anything. I don't think it'll happen  not in our lifetime.
You never know. What about all those people who say they've been inside spaceships and talked to aliens?
I think they're nutters.
Yeah. Me too!
 How did you end up here?
 Geniuses from all over the world come here.
Oh, right. You're a genius.
Sorry, but yeah. I can't help it. I was born clever.
When I was eight, I logged on to the US defence system.
 Nearly caused World War Three.
 Is that funny?
You should have seen them running about. Fantastic!
 You sound like the Doctor.
 Are you and him?
 No, we're just friends.
 Good.
Why is that good?
Just is.
So... Wouldn't you rather be downstairs?
You've got these bits of metal, but Mr Van Statten's got a living creature down there.
Yeah. I did ask, but he keeps it to himself.
Although, if you're a genius, it doesn't take long to patch through on the comms system.
Let's have a look, then.
It doesn't do much  the alien.
It's weird. It's kind of useless.
It's just like this great big pepperpot.
It's being tortured. Where's the Doctor?
 I don't know.
 Take me down there now.
 The metal is armour.
 The creature's inside. It's a mutation.
The Dalek race was genetically engineered. Every emotion was removed except hate.
Genetically engineered by whom?
By a genius, a man who was king of his own world. You'd like him.
It's been on Earth for over 50 years, sold from one collection to another.
 Why is it a threat now?
 Because I'm here. How did it reach Earth?
Records say it came from the sky like a meteorite. It hit the Ascension Islands.
It burnt in its crater for three days. In all that time, it was screaming.
It must have gone insane.
 It fell through time. The only survivor.
 You mentioned a war.
The Time War. The battle between my people and the Dalek race.
 But you survived, too.
 Not by choice.
This means the Dalek isn't the only alien on Earth, Doctor. There's you.
The only one of your kind in existence.
Now smile!
Two hearts. A binary vascular system. Oh, I am so gonna patent this!
You don't just collect this stuff. You scavenge it.
This technology has been falling to Earth for centuries.
All it took was the right mind to use it properly.
Oh, the advances I've made from alien junk! You have no idea, Doctor.
Broadband? Roswell.
Last year, my scientists cultivated bacteria from the Russian crater. Do you know what we found?
The cure for the common cold.
Kept it within the laboratory, of course.
No need to get people excited. Why sell one cure when I can sell 1,000 palliatives?
Do you know what a Dalek is, Van Statten?
A Dalek is honest. It does what it was born to do for the survival of its species.
That creature is better than you.
In that case, I will be true to myself and continue.
That thing downstairs is going to kill every last one of us!
Nothing can escape the Cage.
It's woken up. It knows I'm here. It's going to get out.
Van Statten, I swear, no one on this base is safe. No one on this planet.
Agh!
 Hold it!
 Level three access.
Special clearance from Mr Van Statten.
Don't get too close.
Hello.
Are you in pain? I'm Rose Tyler. My friend can help. He's called the Doctor.
What's your name?
Yes.
What?
I am in pain.
They torture me, but still they fear me.
Do you fear me?
No.
I am dying.
No, we can help.
I welcome death.
But I am glad...
... that before I die I have met a human who was not afraid.
Isn't there anything I can do?
My race is dead.
I shall die alone.
Rose, no!
Genetic material extrapolated!
Initiate cellular reconstruction!
What the hell have you done?
What you gonna do? Sucker me to death  Do something!
 Condition Red.
<i>Condition Red. This is not a drill</i> Release me if you want to live.
 You've got to keep it in that cell. <i>- It's all my fault.</i> <i>It can't get out.</i> <i>That lock's got a billion combinations.</i> A Dalek can calculate 1,000 billion combinations in a second.
Open fire!
 Don't shoot it. I want it unharmed.
 Rose, get out of there!
De Maggio, get the civilians out alive.
 That is your job. You got that?
 Come with me.
Abandoning the Cage, sir.
We're losing power. It's draining the base.
It's draining the entire power supplies of Utah.
 It's downloading.
 Downloading what?
 The entire West Coast has gone down.
 It's not just energy.
That Dalek absorbed the internet. It knows everything.
The Daleks survive in me!
 The cameras in the Vault are down.
 We've only got emergency power. Kill it now!
All guards to converge on the Metaltron Cage immediately.
Civilians. Let 'em through.
Cover the north wall. Maintain suppressing fire along the perimeter.
Agh!
 Stop the shooting.
 But it's killing them.
They're dispensable. That Dalek is unique. I don't want a scratch on it. Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
That's us, below the surface. That's the Cage. That's the Dalek.
 Do you have any alien weapons?
 Yes, but the Dalek's between us and them.
We've got to keep that thing alive.
 We could seal the Vault.
 Trapping everyone.
Rose is down there. I won't let that happen.
 What's this area?
 Weapons testing.
Give guns to the technicians, the lawyers, everyone. It's your only chance of killing it.
Stairs! That's more like it. It hasn't got legs. It's stuck.
It's coming! Get up!
Great big alien death machine 
defeated by a flight of stairs.
 Listen to me.
 I demand that you return to your Cage.
If you want to negotiate, Mr Van Statten will agree to talk.
I accept that we imprisoned you and maybe that was wrong, but people have died.
That stops right now.
The killing stops. Have you got that?
I demand that you surrender. Is that clear?
Elevate!
My God!
Adam, get her out of here.
 Come with us. You can't stop it.
 Someone's gotta try. Now get out!
Don't look back. Just run.
I thought you were the great expert.
Why not just reason with this Dalek? It must be willing to negotiate.
 Everything needs something.
 What's the nearest town?
 Salt Lake City. Population one million.
 All dead.
 The Dalek will murder every living creature.
 Why?
Because it believes they should die. Anything different is wrong.
It's the ultimate in racial cleansing, and you've let it loose.
The Dalek is surrounded by a force field, but it's not indestructible.
<i>Concentrate your fire and you might get through.</i> Aim for the eyepiece. That's the weak spot.
Thank you, Doctor, but I think I know how to fight one single tin robot Positions!
Hold your fire.
You two, get the hell out of there!
 It was looking at me.
 It wants to slaughter us.
 It was looking right at me.
 It's just a metal eye thing.
 It's looking all around.
 I don't know.
It's like there's something inside, looking at me like...
Like it knows me.
On my mark...
Open fire!
We've got vision.
It wants us to see.
Fall back!
Maybe we should consider abandoning this place.
There's no power to the helipad.
 We can't get out.
 You said we could seal the Vault.
It was designed to be a bunker in a nuclear war. Steel bulkheads close off the area.
 There's not enough power.
 Reroute the emergency power.
 We'd need a computer genius.
 Good thing you've got me, then!
 You want to help?
 I don't want to die, Doctor.
 Nobody knows this software better than me.
 Sir...
<i>I shall speak only to the Doctor.</i> You're gonna get rusty.
<i>I fed off the DNA of Rose Tyler.</i> <i>Extrapolating the biomass</i> <i>of a time traveller regenerated me.</i>  What's your next trick? <i>- I have been searching for the Daleks.</i> Yeah, I saw  downloading the internet. What did you find?
 I scanned your satellites and radio telescopes.
 And?
<i>Nothing.</i> <i>Where shall I get my orders now?</i>  You're just a soldier without commands.
 Then I shall follow the Primary Order 
the Dalek instinct to destroy, to conquer!
What for? What's the point?
Don't you see it's all gone? Everything you were, everything you stood for.
Then what should I do?
All right, then.
If you want orders, follow this one.
 Kill yourself.
 The Daleks must survive!
The Daleks have failed. Why don't you make the Daleks extinct, rid the universe of your filth? Why don't you just die?
You would make a good Dalek.
Seal the Vault.
I'll feed power from the ground defences to the bulkheads.
 It's years since I've worked so fast!
 Having fun?
She's still down there.
This isn't the best time.
 <i>Where are you?</i>   Level 49.
Keep moving. The Vault's being sealed off up at level 46.
 Can't you stop 'em closing?
 I can't wait and I can't help you.
<i>Now, for God's sake, run</i>  Done it. We've got power.
 The Dalek's behind them.
Nearly there. Give us two seconds.
I can't sustain the power. The system is failing. We have to close the bulkheads.
I'm sorry.
Come on!
The Vault is sealed.
Rose, where are you? Did you make it?
Sorry. I was a bit slow.
See you, then, Doctor.
It wasn't your fault. Remember that, OK? It wasn't your fault.
<i>And do you know what?</i> I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
<i>Exterminate</i>  I killed her.
 I'm sorry.
I said I'd protect her. She was only here because of me, and you're sorry?
I could have killed that Dalek in its cell, but you stopped me.
 It was the prize of my collection.
 Was it worth it?
Worth all those men's deaths? Worth Rose?
Let me tell you something. Mankind goes into space to explore.
 To be part of something greater.
 Exactly! I wanted to touch the stars.
You just want to drag the stars down, underground underneath tons of sand and dirt, and label them.
You're as far from the stars as you can get.
And you took her down with you.
She was 19 years old.
Go on, then. Kill me.
Why are you doing this?
I am armed. I will kill.
 It is my purpose.
 They're all dead because of you.
They are dead because of us.
And now what? What are you waiting for?
I feel your fear.
What do you expect?
Daleks do not fear. Must not fear.
You gave me life.
What else have you given me?
I am contaminated.
 You were quick on your feet  I'm not the one who sealed the Vault.
<i>Open the bulkhead or Rose Tyler dies.</i> You're alive!
<i>Can't get rid of me</i> I thought you were dead.
<i>Open the bulkhead</i> <i>Don't do it.</i> <i>What use are emotions</i> <i>if you will not save the woman you love?</i> I killed her once.
I can't do it again.
What do we do now, you bleeding heart? What the hell do we do?
 Kill it.
 The alien weapons are in the Vault.
Only the catalogued ones.
Broken.
Broken.
Hairdryer.
Mr Van Statten tends to wipe people's memory.
I kept this in case I needed to fight my way out one day.
 What, YOU in a fight?
 I could do.
Are you gonna throw your A levels at 'em Oh, yes.
Lock and load!
 Don't kill 'em. You didn't kill me.
 But why not?
Why are you alive?
My function is to kill.
What am I?
What am I?
Don't move. It's beginning to question itself.
Van Statten, you tortured me.
 Why?
 I wanted to help you.
I don't know. I thought if we could get through to you, we could mend you. I wanted you better.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I swear. I just wanted you to talk!
Then hear me talk now. Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Don't do it. Don't kill him!
You don't have to do this any more.
There must be something else, not just killing. What else is there? What do you want?
I want freedom.
You're out. You made it.
 I never thought I'd feel the sunlight again.
 How... does... it... feel?
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way now!
 No. I won't let you do this.
 That thing killed hundreds of people.
It's not the one pointing the gun at me.
I've got to do this. I've got to end it. The Daleks destroyed my home, my people.
 I've got nothing left.
 Look at it.
What's it doing?
It wants the sunlight.
 It can't...
 It couldn't kill Van Statten or me.
It's changing.
What about you, Doctor?
What the hell are you changing into?
I couldn't...
I wasn't...
Oh, Rose. They're all dead.
Why do we survive?
I don't know.
I am the last of the Daleks.
You're not even that.
Rose did more than regenerate you.
You've absorbed her DNA.
You're mutating.
Into what?
Something new.
I'm sorry.
Isn't that better?
Not for a Dalek.
I can feel.
So many ideas.
So much darkness.
Rose, give me orders.
Order me to die.
I can't do that.
This is not life.
This is sickness.
I shall not be like you.
Order my destruction!
Obey! Obey!
Obey!
Do it.
Are you frightened, Rose Tyler?
Yeah.
So am I.
Exterminate.
 What the hell are you doing?
 200 personnel dead because of you, sir.
Wipe his memory and leave him by the road someplace.
You can't do this. I am Henry Van Statten!
By tonight, you'll be a homeless, brainless junkie living on the streets of San Diego, Seattle, Sacramento.
Someplace beginning with S.
A piece of home. Better than nothing.
 Is that the end of it, the Time War?
 I'm the only one left.
I win. How about that The Dalek survived. Maybe some of your people did, too.
I know. In here.
 Feels like there's no one.
 Well, then.
 Good thing I'm not going anywhere.
 Yeah.
We'd better get out. Van Statten's disappeared. Goddard says they're filling this with cement.
 About time!
 I'll have to go back home.
You'd better hurry up.
 Next flight to Heathrow is at 1500.
 Adam said that he wanted to see the stars.
Tell him to stand outside, then.
He's all on his own, and he DID help.
 He left you there.
 So did you.
 We've got to leave!
 Plus, he's a bit pretty.
I hadn't noticed.
 On your own head.
 What are you doing?
She said cement! She wasn't joking. We're going to get sealed in!
Doctor? What are you doing standing inside a box?
Rose?
 @@@@@@
@@@@@@
<i>Solar flare activity has increased across</i> <i>space lanes 5,5,6. All commercial flights are...</i> So, it's 200,000. It's a spaceship... No, a space station, and, er...
 Try that gate over there.
 200,000?
 200,000.
 Nice.
Adam! Out you come.
 Oh, my God!
 Don't worry. You'll get used to it.
 Where are we?
 Good question. Let's see.
Judging by the architecture, I'd say we're around the year 200,000, and if you listen...
Engines. We're in a space station.
Yeah, definitely a space station. It's a bit warm in here. They could turn the heating down.
Tell you what  let's try that gate. Come on.
Here we go.
And this is...
I'll let the Doctor describe it.
The Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. There it is  Planet Earth at its height.
Covered with mega-cities, five moons, population 96 billion.
The hub of a galactic domain stretching across a million planets, a million species, with mankind right in the middle.
He's your boyfriend Not any more.
Come on, Adam. Open your mind. You'll like this  fantastic period of history.
The human race at its most intelligent  art, politics, fine food, good manners...
Out the way!
 Is somebody there? That's great.
 What do you want, love?
One at a time. What was it? Kronkburger with cheese, kronkburger with pajatos.
Do you want a drink? Oi! Stop pushing!
Get back! I said, back!
 Fine cuisine?
 My watch must be wrong.
 No, it's fine. It's weird.
 Your history's not as good as you thought.
 It's perfect.
 Obviously not.
What about the millions of planets and species? Where are they?
That is a good question.
 Adam, me old mate. You must be starving.
 No, I'm a bit timesick.
You need some grub. How much is a kronkburger?
Two credits twenty, sweetheart. Now, join the queue!
We need money. Let's use a cashpoint.
 Pocket money. Don't spend it all on sweets.
 How does it work?
Go and find out. Stop nagging me! Time travel's like visiting Paris. Don't just read a guidebook.
Throw yourself in  eat the food, get charged double and kiss complete strangers...
Or is that just me?
Stop asking questions. Go and do it!
 Off you go. Your first date  You're gonna get a smack, you are!
This is gonna sound daft, but can you tell me where I am?
 Floor 139.
 Could they write it any bigger  Floor 139 of what?
 Must have been some party!
 You're on Satellite Five.
 What's that?
 How could you not know where you are?
 I'm stupid!
Wait a minute. Are you a test? Some sort of management test kind of thing?
You've got me. You're too clever for me.
We were warned about this in basic training.
Workers have to be versed in company promotion.
Right. Fire away. If it gets me to Floor 500,  I'll do anything.
 What happens on Floor 500?
The walls are made of gold!
And you should know, Mr Management!
So, this is what we do.
Latest news  sandstorms on the New Venus Archipelago, 200 dead.
The Glasgow water riots into their third day. Space lane 77 closed by sunspot activity.
And the Face of Boe has just announced he's pregnant.
You broadcast the news.
We ARE the news. We're the journalists.
We write it, package it and sell it. 600 channels broadcasting out of Satellite Five.
Something... is wrong.
Something fictional.
Those people.
<i>Nothing happens in the whole empire</i> <i>without it going through us.</i> Security check.
Go deep.
<i>Staff are reminded that the canteen</i> <i>area operates a self-cleaning table system.</i> Try this. It's called Zaffic. It's like a Slush Puppy.
What flavour?
Sort of beef.
Oh, my God!
It's like everything's gone  home, family  everything.
This helps. The Doctor gave it a top-up.
 Who's back home? Your mum and dad?
 Yeah.
 Phone 'em up.
 But that's 198,000 years ago.
Honestly. Try it. Go on.
 Is there a code for Planet Earth?
 Just dial!
<i>- Sorry we're not in.</i>  <i>- Please leave a message. Thanks.</i> Hi. It's me.
<i>I've sort of gone travelling.</i> <i>I met these people and we're travelling together.</i> I'm fine, and I'll call you later. Love you. Bye.
That is so...
Oi, Mutt and Jeff! Over here.
 <i>Security check cleared.</i>   No. Something's wrong.
I can taste it.
A tiny little shift in the information.
Someone down there shouldn't be here.
Double-check. Triple-check.
Follow them.
Now, everybody behave. We have a management inspection.
 How do you want it, by the book?
 Right from scratch, thanks.
OK, so, ladies, gentlemen, multisex, undecided or robot, my name is Cathica Santini Khadeni.
That's Cathica with a C, in case you want to write to Floor 500 praising me  please do!
Feel free to ask questions. The process of news-gathering must open, honest and beyond bias.
 That's company policy.
 Actually, it's the law.
Thank you, Suki. OK, keep it calm. Don't show off for the guests.
Here we go.
And...
... engage safety.
And three... two...
and spike.
Compressed information, streaming into her.
Reports from every city, every country, every planet, and they all get packaged inside her head.
She becomes part of the software. Her brain IS the computer.
 If it goes through her, she must be a genius.
 She wouldn't remember it.
There's too much. Her head would blow up.
The brain's the processor. Soon as it closes, she forgets.
What about all these people?
They've got tiny chips in their head, connecting them to her. They transmit 600 channels.
Every single fact in the Empire beams out of this place.
Now, that's what I call power.
<i>- Analysis confirmed.</i>  <i>- Security breach.</i> I knew it!
Which one? It's someone inside that room. Which one?
<i>Isolating breach.</i> Come on. Show me. Who is it?
<i>- Are you OK?</i>  <i>- I can see her brain.</i>  Do you want to get out?
 No. This technology, it's amazing.
This technology's wrong.
Trouble?
Oh, yeah.
That's it! Oh, yes! She's the liar.
Intercept and scan.
Gotcha!
Suki! I wasn't even halfway. What was that for?
 Sorry. It must have been a glitch.
 Oh!
Her information's been tampered with. There's a second biography hidden underneath.
Absolutely, sir.
Her data was encrypted, so there was no way we could have found her sooner.
Sorry, sir.
Absolutely.
Get her up here. Now.
<i>Promotion</i> Come on! This is it. Come on!
Oh, my God. Make it me.
Come on. Say my name.
Say my name!
<i>Promotion for Suki Macrae Cantrell.</i>  <i>Proceed to Floor 500.</i>  I don't believe it!
Floor 500!
How the hell did you manage that? I'm above you!
I don't know. I just applied on the off chance.
And they've said yes!
It's so not fair! I've been applying to Floor 500 for three years!
What's Floor 500?
The walls are made of gold.
Cathica, I'm gonna miss you!
 Floor 500! Thank you!
 I didn't do anything.
 Well, you're my lucky charm!
 All right. I'll hug anyone.
 Come on. It's not that bad.
 What, with the head thing?
 Well, she's closed it now.
 Yeah, but it...
It's everything. It freaks me out.
I just need to... If I could just...
... cool down. Sort of acclimatise.
 How do you mean?
Maybe I could sit on the observation deck. Would that be all right?
Soak it in, you know. Pretend I'm a citizen of the year 200,000.
Do you want me to come with you?
No, no. You stick with the Doctor.
You'd rather be with him.
It's gonna take a better man than me to get between you two.
 Anyway, I'll be on the deck.
 Here you go. Take the Tardis key.
Just in case it gets a bit too much.
Yeah, like it's not weird in there I've got to go. I can't keep them waiting. I'm sorry!
Say goodbye to Steve for me.
Bye!
Good riddance!
 You're talking like you'll never see her again.
 We won't.
Once you go to Floor 500, you never come back.
Have you ever been up there?
I can't. The key for the lift only comes with promotion.
No one gets to 500 except for the chosen few.
Agh!
 Who are you?
 I'm the Editor.
What's happening?
There are bodies out there. What's going on?
While we're asking questions, please confirm your name.
<i>My name is Suki Macrae Cantrell.</i> <i>I was born 199'89</i>  <i>in the Independent Republic of Morocco.</i>  Liar!
<i>Hobbies include reading and archaeology.</i> <i>I'm not an expert, I just like digging.</i> Liar!
<i>I want to work for Satellite Five</i> <i>because my sister can't afford university</i>  <i>and the pay scheme is really good.</i>  Liar!
Let's look at the facts, shall we?
Ah, hidden behind a genetic graft, but that's still you.
Eva Saint Julienne  last surviving member of the Freedom Fifteen.
 Self-declared anarchist, is that right?
 Who controls Satellite Five?
There's the truth!
The Freedom Foundation has been monitoring Satellite Five's transmissions.
The facts are being manipulated.
 You are lying to the people.
 Ooh, I love it. Say it again!
This whole system is corrupt.
Who do you represent?
I am merely a humble slave. I answer to the Editor-in-chief.
 Who is he? Where is he?
 He oversees everything. Literally everything.
If you don't mind, I'm going to have to refer this upwards.
 What is that?
 Your boss.
This has always been your boss  since the day you were born.
Agh!
Give me access.
Give me...
I can learn anything!
Let's try computers.
From the 21st century to the present day, give me the history of the microprocessor.
Oh, my God!
We only get 20 minutes' maintenance.
 Give it a rest!
 You've never been to another floor?
I went to Floor 16 when I first arrived. That's Medical. I got my head done. Then I came here.
Satellite Five. We work, eat and sleep on the same floor.
 You're not Management, are you?
 At last! She's clever!
 Well, whatever it is, I don't know anything.
 Don't you ask?
 Why would I?
 You're a journalist!
 Why is all the crew human?
 What's that got to do with anything?
 There's no aliens on board. Why?
 I dunno. They're not banned or anything.
Then where are they?
I suppose Immigration's tightened up because of the threats.
 What threats?
 I dunno.
All of them. Usual stuff. And the price of spacewarp doubled, so that kept visitors away.
And the government on Chavic Five collapsed, so that lot stopped coming.
Just lots of little reasons.
Adding up to one big fact, and you didn't even notice.
If there was a conspiracy, Satellite Five would have seen it. We see everything.
This society's the wrong shape. Even the technology.
 It's cutting edge!
 It's backwards. There's a door in your head!
 What do you think's going on?
 It's the attitude. The way people think.
The Great and Bountiful Human Empire's stunted.
 How would you know?
 Trust me.
Humanity's been set back about 90 years.
When did Satellite Five start broadcasting?
91 years ago.
Mum, Dad, keep this message, OK?
<i>- Whatever you do, don't erase it.</i>  <i>- Save it. You got that?</i> OK.
The microprocessor became redundant in the year 2019, replaced by a system called SMT, that's Single Molecule Transcription.
No, no, no! What are you doing? Come back!
Why are you doing that?
What's Floor 16? What's down there?
Sorry, um... Floor 16, that's, um...
 What do you cover?
 Medical non-emergency.
Wrong floor. I'm having technical difficulties.
 My screen keeps locking me out.
 No, that's medical.
There must be something wrong with your chip.
Yes. Yeah, of course, yeah.
 I haven't got one.
 No wonder you can't get a screen to work.
 What are you? A... student?
 Yes.
Yeah, I'm... I'm on a research project from the University of Mars.
 The Martian boondocks. Typical!
 Yep!
 Well, you still need chipping.
 So does that mean like brain surgery?
That's an old-fashioned phrase, but it's the same thing, yes.
Oh, OK. Never mind.
But if I get a chip... that means I could use any computer.
Absolutely.
You'll have to pay for it.
They've stopped subsidising.
Oh, right. Sorry. Wasting your time. Thanks.
Hold on.
Can I use this?
That'll do nicely.
It all comes down to two basic types.
Type one  the head chip  inserted into the back of the skull. 100 credits.
There's the chip. Tiny. Invisible.
No scarring.
Type two is the full info-spike.
 Oh, that's the...
 thing.
That's the one. It does cost 10,000.
Oh, well, I couldn't afford it, then.
Not at all.
It turns out you've got unlimited credit.
No, but I... I couldn't have it done. I mean... that's got to hurt.
 Hasn't it?
 Painless. Contractual guarantee.
No, my mate's waiting upstairs. I can't have major surgery.
It takes ten minutes.
That sort of money buys a very fast picosurgeon.
No, but I...
I couldn't, though, no. It's...
Type one, you can interface with a simple computer.
Type two, you ARE the computer.
You can transmit any piece of information from the archive of Satellite Five, which is just about the entire history of the human race.
Now...
Which one's it going to be?
We're so gonna get in trouble!
 You're not allowed to touch the mainframe!
 Rose, tell her to button it.
If you vandalise the place, they'll notice!
I don't understand. We did a full security scan.
That man was there when we found Suki Macrae Cantrell.
There were no indications about him.
And yet here he is 
clearly acting outside the parameters.
Fascinating!
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
At once!
Check him. Double-check him. Triple-check him.
Quadruple.
 I'm going back to work.
 Go on, then. See you.
 I can't just leave you, can I?
 Get 'em to turn the heating down.
 It's boiling. Can't they do something about it?
 It's something to do with the turbine.
 Something to do with the turbine  Well, I don't know!
Exactly. I give up on you, Cathica. Now, Rose asked the right question.
 I thank you.
 Why is it so hot?
 Why worry about the central heating?
 Never underestimate plumbing.
Plumbing's very important.
 <i>Security scan complete.</i>   Well, who is he?
<i>He is no one.</i> What does that mean?
 <i>He is no one.</i>  What, you mean he has a fake ID?
<i>He has no identification.</i> But everyone's registered. We have a census for the entire Empire.
 <i>He is no one.</i>  What, he doesn't exist?
 Not anywhere? <i>- He is no one.</i> What about the blonde?
 <i>She is no one.</i>  Both of them?!
Well...
We all know what happens to non-entities. They get promoted!
Bring 'em up.
Satellite Five  pipes and plumbing. Look at the layout.
This is ridiculous. You've got access to the computer's core.
You could look at the archive, the stock exchange... and you're looking at pipes?
But there's something wrong.
 I suppose...
 Why, what is it?
The ventilation system. Cooling ducts, ice filters, all working flat out,  channelling massive amounts of heat down.
 From the top.
 Floor 500.
 Something is generating tons of heat.
I feel like I'm missing out on a party. It's all going on upstairs. Fancy a trip?
 You need a key.
 Keys are just codes. I've got them right here.
Here we go. Override 215.9.
 How come it gave YOU the code?
 Someone up there likes me.
I told you it was painless.
No scarring, you see?
Perfect success.
How do I activate it?
It's a personal choice.
Some people whistle.
I know one man who triggers it with "Oh, Danny Boy".
You're set on default for now. That's a click of the fingers.
So, you mean I just?
Click.
 Come with us.
 No way.
 Bye!
 Well, don't mention my name.
When you get in trouble, don't involve me.
That's her gone. Adam's given up. It's just you and me.
 Yeah.
 Good.
Yep.
Oh, my God! I'm going to be sick.
Special offer.
We installed the vomit-o-matic too. Nano-termites are in the lining of your throat.
In the event of sickness...
... they freeze the waste.
The walls are not made of gold.
You should go back downstairs.
Tough!
I started without you.
This is fascinating! Satellite Five contains every piece of information within the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire 
birth certificates, shopping habits, bank statements  but you two, you don't exist.
There's not a trace. No birth. No job.
Not the slightest kiss. How can you walk through the world and not leave a single footprint?
Suki!
Hello? Can you hear me?
Suki! What have you done to her?
I think she's dead.
 She's working.
 The chips in their head keep going.
 Like puppets.
 Oh! You're full of information!
It's only fair we get some information back because, apparently, you're no one.
It's so rare not to know something. Who are you?
It doesn't matter 'cause we're off. Nice to meet you. Come on.
 Tell me who you are.
 That fact is keeping us alive. I won't say.
My Editor-in-chief might convince you otherwise.
And who's that?
It may interest you to know that this is not the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire.
It's not human at all! It's merely a place where humans happen to live.
Yeah.
Yep. Sorry.
It's a place where humans are allowed to live by kind permission of my client.
 What is that?
 That thing's in charge of Satellite Five?
That thing, as you put it, is in charge of the human race.
For almost 100 years, mankind's behaviour has been controlled by its broadcast news, edited by my superior, your master and humanity's guiding light, the Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.
I call him Max.
Create a climate of fear and it's easy to keep the borders closed.
It's just a matter of emphasis. The right word in the right broadcast repeated often enough can destabilise an economy, invent an enemy, change a vote.
So all the people on Earth are like slaves?
Well, now, there's an interesting point.
Is a slave a slave if he doesn't know he's enslaved?
 Yes.
 Oh! I was hoping for a philosophical debate.
 Is that all I'm going to get. "Yes"?
 Yes.
You're no fun.
Undo these. You'll find out how much fun I am.
Ooh, he's tough, isn't he?
But come on. Isn't it a great system? You've got to admire it a little bit.
You can't hide this. Someone must have noticed.
From time to time, yes, but the computer chip system allows me to see inside their brains.
I can see the smallest doubt, then crush it.
Then they just carry on, living the life, strutting about downstairs and all over the Earth like they're so individual when they're not  they're just cattle.
In that respect, the Jagrafess hasn't changed a thing.
 What about you? You're not a Jagrabelly thing.
 Jagrafess.
 You're not a Jagrafess. You're human.
 Simply being human doesn't pay very well.
 You couldn't have done this on your own.
 No!
I represent a consortium of banks.
Money prefers a long-term investment.
Also, the Jagrafess needed a hand to install himself.
No wonder. He's big.
 What's his lifespan?
 3,000 years.
That's a huge metabolism generating heat. That's why Satellite Five's so hot.
You pump it out of the creature, channel it downstairs. Jagrafess stays cool and alive.
Satellite Five is a life-support system.
<i>It's me again. Don't wipe this message.</i> It's just going to sound like white noise, but save it 'cause I can translate it, OK?
Three, two, one... and spike.
But that's why you're so dangerous.
Knowledge is power, but you remain unknown.
Who are you?
Leave her alone. I'm the Doctor, she's Rose Tyler. We're nothing.
Tell me who you are.
 I just said.
 Who do you work for?
Who sent you? Who knows about us? Who exactly?
Agh!
Time Lord!
 What?
 Oh, yes!
The last of the Time Lords and his travelling machine.
 With his little human girl from long ago.
 What are you talking about?
Time travel.
Agh!
Help!
Someone's been telling you lies.
Young Master Adam Mitchell?
<i>Help! Agh!</i> Oh, my God, his head!
What the hell's he done?
What the hell's he done? They're reading his mind.
 He's telling them everything.
 I know everything about you.
Every piece of information in his head is now mine.
And you have infinite knowledge, Doctor.
The Human Empire is tiny compared to what you've seen in your T-A-R-D-l-S. Tardis.
 You'll never get that. I'll die first.
 Die all you like. I've got the key.
 You and your boyfriends!
 Today, WE are the headlines.
We can rewrite history. We could prevent mankind from developing.
No one will stop you because you've bred a human race which doesn't ask questions.
Stupid little slaves believing every lie.
They'll trot right into the slaughterhouse if they're told it's made of gold.
Disengage safety.
What's happening?
Maximum access. Override floor 139.
And spike!
Someone's disengaged the safety.
Who's that?
 It's Cathica!
 She's thinking. She's using what she knows!
Terminate her access!
Everything I told her about the pipes, the filters  she's reversing it.
Look at that! It's getting hot.
I said terminate her!
Burn out her mind!
Oh, no, you don't. You should have promoted me years back!
She's venting the heat up here. The Jagrafess has to stay cool  now it's on top of a volcano!
Yes, I'm trying, sir, but...
It's impossible  a member of staff with an idea!
 What do I do?
 Flick the switch!
Oi! Do you want to bank on a certainty?
Massive heat in a massive body  massive bang!
See you in the headlines!
If it's all the same to you, I think I'll resign. Bye.
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Agh!
We're gonna go. Too many questions. You'll manage.
 No one will believe me.
 They might believe a lot of things now.
 Humans will get back to normal.
 What about your friend?
He's not my friend.
 Now, don't...
 I'm all right now.
Much better. And I've got the key.
Look, it's...
It all worked out for the best, didn't it?
You know, it's not actually my fault because you were in charge...
This is my house! I'm home.
Oh, my God, I'm home! Blimey! I thought you were going to chuck me out of an airlock.
 Is there something else you want to tell me?
 No. What do you mean?
The archive of Satellite Five. One second of that message could have changed the world.
 That's it, then. See you.
 How do you mean, see you?
 As in goodbye.
 What about me? You can't just go.
 I have a chip type two. My head opens.
 Like this?
 Don't.
 Don't do what?
Stop it!
All right, that's enough. Stop it.
Thank you.
 Oi!
 Sorry. I couldn't resist.
 History could have changed because of you.
 I just wanted to help.
 You were helping yourself.
 I said I'm sorry, and I am.
You can't just leave me like this.
If anyone sees that head, they'll dissect you in seconds. You'll have to lead a quiet life.
Be average. Unseen. Good luck.
But I want to come with you.
I only take the best. I've got Rose.
Rose!
 Oh, my God!
 Who's that? Geoff, is that you?
 It's me, Mum. Don't come in. Wait there.
 Oh, my Lord!
You never said you were coming home!
Hold on. I'll just take my coat off.
Rose, take me with you.
What's that noise?
Have you left the back door open? Blimey, there's a draught!
What a surprise! Let me look at you!
Six months!
It's like I saw you yesterday. Time goes by like that.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
<i>Peter Alan Tyler, my dad.</i> <i>The most wonderful man In the world.</i> <i>Born 15th September, 1954.</i> Come here, Rose. Come here.
Who's that? It's your daddy.
You weren't old enough to remember when he died.
1987, 7th November.
Do you remember what I told you?
The day that Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clark got married.
He was always having adventures.
He would have loved to have seen you now.
That's what Mum always says.
So I was thinking, could we go and see my dad when he was still alive?
Where's this come from all of a sudden?
All right, if we can't, if it goes against the laws of time or something, then never mind, just leave it.
No, I can do anything. I'm just more worried about you.
I want to see him.
Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for.
I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Prentice.
I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline...
Susanne, Suzette...
Anita?
Just carry on. It's good enough for Lady Di.
I thought he'd be taller.
To be my lawful wedded wife. To love and behold till death us do part.
<i>He died so close to home.</i> I wasn't there. Nobody was.
It was a hit-and-run driver.
Never found out who.
He was dead when the ambulance got there.
I only wish there'd been someone there for him.
<i>- I want to be that someone.</i>  <i>- So he doesn't die alone.</i>  November 7th?
 1987.
It's so weird.
The day my father died.
I thought it'd be all sort of grim and stormy. It's just an ordinary day.
The past is another country.
1987 is just the Isle of Wight.
 You sure about this?
 Yeah.
This is it. Jordan Road.
He was late.
He'd been to get a wedding present, a vase.
Mum always said, "That stupid vase." He got out of his car...
and crossed the road.
Oh, God, this is it.
Go to him. Quick.
It's too late now.
By the time the ambulance got there, he was dead.
He can't die on his own.
Can I try again?
Right, that's the first you and me.
It's a very bad idea, two sets of us being here at the same time.
Just be careful they don't see us.
Wait till she runs off and he follows then go to your dad.
Oh, God, this is it.
I can't do this.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
But this is the last time we can be here.
Rose, no!
I did it. I saved your life.
Blimey, did you see the speed of it? Did you get his number?
I really did it. Oh, my God, look at you, you're alive.
That car was gonna kill you.
Give me some credit, I did see it coming. I wasn't gonna walk under it, was I?
I'm Rose.
That's a coincidence. That's my daughter's name.
That's a great name. Good choice. Well done.
Right. I better shift. I've got a wedding to go to.
 Is that Sarah Clark's wedding?
 Yeah. Are you going?
Yeah.
Do you and your boyfriend need a lift?
Right, there we go, sorry about the mess.
If you want a cup of tea, kitchen's down there, milk's in the fridge.
It would be, wouldn't it? Where else would you put the milk?
Mind you, there's always the windowsill outside.
I always thought if someone invented a windowsill with special compartments, one for milk, one for yoghurt, make a lot of money out of that. Sell it to students and things.
I should write that down.
Anyway, never mind that. Excuse me, I got to go and change.
All the stuff Mum kept. His stuff.
She kept it all packed away in boxes in the cupboard.
She used to show me when she'd had a bit to drink.
Here it is, on display.
Where it should be.
Third prize at the bowling. First two got to go to Didcot.
Health drinks.
Tonics Mum used to call them.
He made his money selling this Vitex stuff.
He had all sorts of jobs, he was so clever.
Solar power. Mum said he was going to do this.
Now he can.
Okay, I'll tell him you're not my boyfriend.
When we met I said, "Travel with me in space." You said, "No." Then I said, "Time machine." It wasn't some big plan.
I just saw it happening, and I thought, "I can stop it." I did it again. I picked another stupid ape.
I should have known. It's not about showing you the universe. It never is.
It's about the universe doing something for you.
So it's okay when you go to other times and you save people's lives but not when it's me saving my dad?
I know what I'm doing, you don't.
Two sets of us being there made that a vulnerable point.
But he's alive.
My entire planet died, my whole family.
Do you think it never occurred to me to go back and save them?
But it's not like I've changed history.
Not much. I mean, he's never gonna be a world leader, he's not gonna start World War III.
Rose, there's a man alive in the world who wasn't alive before.
An ordinary man. That's the most important thing in creation.
The whole world's different because he's alive.
 Would you rather him dead?
 I'm not saying that...
No, I get it. For once, you're not the most important man in my life.
Let's see how you get on without me. Give me the key.
The Tardis key. If I'm so insignificant, give it me back.
All right then, I will.
You've got what you wanted so that's goodbye, then.
You don't scare me.
I know how sad you are. You'll be back in a minute.
Or you'll hang around outside the Tardis waiting for me.
And I'll make you wait a long time.
Boyfriend trouble?
Excuse me, do you mind? What are you tidying up for?
Sorry, force of habit.
Don't worry about him. Couples have rows all the time.
We're not a couple. Why does everyone think we're a couple?
 I think he left me.
 What? A pretty girl like you?
 If I was going out with you...
 Stop right there.
I'm just saying...
I know what you're saying and we're not going there.
At no point are we going anywhere near there.
You aren't even aware that there exists...
I don't want to think about there and, believe me, neither do you.
There, for you, is like...
like the Bermuda Triangle.
 Blimey, you know how to flatter a bloke.
 Right. Are we off?
 That wouldn't be a mixed signal at all?
 Absolutely not.
I'll take you back to the loony bin where you belong.
Except I'm sure I've met you somewhere before.
 It's weird.
 What?
There's so many people missing.
Uncle Steven, Auntie Lynn, all the Baxters.
Where are they?
You don't think something's gone wrong?
Maybe it's a godsend, gives you time to think.
You don't have to go through with it, not these days.
 Live in sin for a bit.
 Dad.
In 10 years' time, you'll turn round and say, "If only I could turn the clock back." Is it me or did it just get cold?
Rose.
I met this bloke at the horses and he's cutting me in on copyright.
But I thought you were a proper businessman.
I wish. I do a bit of this, bit of that. I scrape by.
Right. I must've heard wrong.
So, really, you're a bit of a Del Boy.
Shoot me down in flames.
You're not related to my wife by any chance, are you?
Oh, my God. She's gonna be at the wedding.
Jackie? Do you know her?
Sort of.
What's she told you about me, then?
She said she'd picked the most fantastic man in the world.
Must be a different Jackie, then. She'd never say that.
This stuff goes right over my head.
 That's not out yet.
 Good job and all.
 I'm just gonna check my messages.
 How do you mean? Messages?
 Is that a phone?
 Yeah.
<i>Watson, come here. I need you.</i> <i>Watson, come here. I need you.</i> <i>Watson, come here. I need you.</i> Half the guests haven't turned up.
You're better off not being here, it's a disaster in the making.
No, in this case, "knocked her up" is a phrase I'd use.
<i>Watson, come here. I need you.</i> Hello? Who's this?
<i>Watson, come here. I...</i> Dad, get inside. We can't see the bride before the wedding.
 That's bad luck.
 Bad luck when you met her.
I tell you, this day is cursed.
Now that's what I call a meringue.
Stuart's dad said go round the block 'cause there's people missing.
How do you mean, missing?
There's no Dave, no Sunita, no Bee...
There's no one from The Lamb and Flag.
My train's detached again. I knew I should have used Velcro.
I'm here, stop your bellyaching.
Take Rose a sec, will you?
Ain't she pretty?
She's a little madam, that's what she is.
I need more hands.
Where's her useless article of a dad got to?
Dad!
It's that car. Same one as before.
It was right in front of us, where's he gone?
You called me "Dad"? What did you say that for?
Oh, wonderful! Here he is, the accident waiting to happen.
You'd be late for your own funeral and it nearly was.
 No damage done.
 And who's this?
What are you looking at with your mouth open?
 Your hair.
 What?
I've never seen it like...
I mean...
it's lovely, your hair's lovely.
And that baby you're holding.
That would be your baby.
 Another one of yours, is she?
 She saved my life.
That's a new one. What was it last time?
I didn't even know her. She was a cloakroom attendant.
I was helping her look for my ticket.
There were three duffle coats all the same. Somehow the rack collapsed.
We were under all this stuff.
Were you playing around?
What's it got to do with you what he gets up to?
 What does he get up to?
 You'd know.
Because I'm that stupid. I play around and I bring her to meet the missus.
 You silly...
 But you are that stupid.
Can we keep this stuff for back home, just for now?
What, with the rest of the rubbish?
You bring home cut-price detergents, tonic water, Betamax tapes and none of it works.
I'm drowning in your rubbish.
What did he tell you? Did he say he's this big businessman?
'Cause he's not. He's a failure. Born failure, that one.
Rose needs a proper father...
Jackie, I'm making a living. It keeps us fed, doesn't it?
Stop it.
You're not like this. You love each other.
Pete, you never used to like them mental.
 Or I don't know, maybe you did.
 Jackie, wait, listen...
If you're not careful, there'll be a wedding and a divorce on the same day.
Wait here. Give us a couple of minutes with the missus.
Tell you what, straighten the car up. Stick it round the corner.
Don't cause any more trouble.
Hey, Jack.
I'm not listening. It's the duffle coats all over again.
Jackie, sometimes a duffle coat is just a duffle coat.
Things will get better soon. I promise.
I've had enough of all your daft schemes.
I never know where the next meal's coming from.
I'll get it right, love. One day soon, I promise you I'll get it right.
Come on.
Monsters! Going to eat us!
What sort of monsters, sweetheart? Is it aliens?
Rose!
Get in the church!
Get in the church!
Oh, my God. What are they?
Inside!
 Sarah!
 Stay in there!
In.
They can't get in. Old windows and doors. Okay.
The older something is, the stronger it is.
What else?
Go and check the other doors. Move!
What's happening? What are they? What are they?
There's been an accident in time. A wound in time.
They're like bacteria, taking advantage.
What do you mean? Time? What are you jabbering on about time?
I might've known you'd argue.
 Jackie, I'm sick of you complaining.
 How do you know my name?
I've never met you in my life.
You never will unless I sort this out.
If you don't mind, I've waited a long time to say this, Jackie Tyler, do as I say. Go and check the doors.
Yes, sir.
I should've done that ages ago.
 My dad was out there.
 You can mourn him later.
Now we've got to concentrate on keeping ourselves alive.
 My dad had...
 There is nothing I can do for him.
No, but he had this phone thing.
I can't get it to work. I keep getting this voice.
<i>Watson, come here. I need you.</i> That's the very first phone call.
Alexander Graham Bell.
I don't think the telephone's gonna be much use.
Someone must have called the police.
The police can't help you now, no one can.
Nothing in this universe can harm those things.
Time's been damaged and they've come to sterilise the wound.
By consuming everything inside.
Is this because...
Is this my fault?
No!
There's smoke coming up from the city. But no sirens.
I don't think it's just us. I think these things are all over the place.
Maybe the whole world.
Was that a car?
It's not important. Don't worry about it.
This mate of yours. What did he mean, this is your fault?
Don't know. Just everything.
I gave you my car keys.
You don't give your keys to a complete stranger.
It's like I trusted you.
The moment I met you, I just did.
A wound in time.
You called me Dad.
I can see it.
In my eyes.
Jackie's attitude.
You sound like her when you shout.
You are. You are. You're my Rose.
You're my Rose, grown up.
Dad! My dad. My daddy.
Excuse me.
 Mister?
 Doctor.
 You seem to know what's going on.
 I give that impression, yeah.
 I just wanted to ask...
 Can you save us?
Who are you two, then?
 Stuart Hoskins.
 Sarah Clark.
And one extra? Boy or girl?
I don't know. I don't want to know, really.
How did all this get started?
Outside the Beatbox Club, 2:00 in the morning.
Street corner, I'd lost my purse, didn't have money for a taxi.
 I took her home.
 Then what?
Asked her for a date?
 Wrote his number on my hand.
 Never got rid of her since.
My dad said...
I don't know what this is all about and I know we're not important...
Who said you're not important?
I've travelled to all sorts of places, done things you couldn't even imagine.
But you two.
Street corner, 2:00 in the morning, getting a taxi home.
I've never had a life like that.
Yes.
I'll try and save you.
I'm a dad.
I mean, I'm already a dad but Rose grows up and she's you.
That's wonderful.
I mean, I suppose I thought that you'd be a bit useless what with my useless genes and all but...
Well, I mean, how did you get here?
 Do you really want to know?
 Yeah.
A time machine.
 Time machine?
 Cross my heart.
Do you all have time machines where you come from?
No, just the Doctor.
Did you know these things were coming?
No.
God, I don't know, my head's spinning.
What's the future like?
It's not so different.
What am I like? Have I gone grey?
Have I gone bald? Don't tell me I've gone bald.
So, if this mate of yours isn't your boyfriend, and I have to say I'm glad 'cause being your dad and all, I think he's a bit old for you.
 Have you got a bloke?
 No. I did have.
Mickey.
Do you know him?
I just didn't recognise him in a suit. You have to let go of me, sweetheart.
I'm always saying that.
He just grabs hold of what's passing and holds on for dear life.
God help his poor girlfriend if he ever gets one.
 Me and Rose were just talking.
 Oh, yeah? Talking?
While the world comes to an end, what do you do?
Cling to the youngest blonde.
Come on, Mick.
 You can't tell her.
 Why?
I mean, I really don't want you to tell her.
 You don't want people to know?
 Where I come from, Jackie doesn't know how to work the timer on the video recorder.
I showed her that last week.
Point taken.
Rose, you're not going to bring about the end of the world, are you?
Are you?
Jackie gave her to me to look after.
How times change.
I'd better be careful.
I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey like a mother chicken.
No. Don't touch the baby.
You're both the same person, that's a paradox.
We don't want a paradox happening, not with these things outside.
Anything new, any disturbance in time, makes them stronger.
A paradox might let them in.
I can't do anything right, can I?
Since you asked, no. So, don't touch the baby.
 I'm not stupid.
 You could have fooled me.
All right...
I'm sorry.
I wasn't really gonna leave you on your own.
I know.
Between you and me, I haven't got a plan. No idea.
No way out.
You'll think of something.
The entire Earth's been sterilised.
This, and other places like it, are all that's left of the human race.
We might hold out for a while, but nothing can stop those creatures.
They'll get through in the end. The walls aren't that old.
And there's nothing I can do to stop them.
There used to be laws stopping this kind of thing from happening.
My people would have stopped this.
But they're all gone.
And now I'm going the same way.
If I'd realised...
Just...
tell me you're sorry.
I am.
I'm sorry.
Have you got something hot?
It's the Tardis key.
It's telling me it's still connected to the Tardis.
The inside of my ship was thrown out of the wound but we can use this to bring it back.
And once I've got my ship back, then I can mend everything.
Now, I just need a bit of power. Has anybody got a battery?
This one big enough?
Fantastic.
Good old Dad. There you go.
Just need to do a bit of charging up.
And then we can bring everyone back.
You, erm, you never said why you came here in the first place.
If I had a time machine, I wouldn't have thought 1987 was anything special.
Not round here, anyway.
 We just ended up here.
 Lucky for me, eh?
 If you hadn't been there to save me...
 That was just a coincidence.
That was just really good luck. It's amazing.
So, in the future, are me and her indoors still together?
Yeah.
 You still living with us?
 Yep.
Am I a good dad?
You...
You told me a bedtime story every night when I was small.
You were always there, you never missed one.
And, erm...
you took us for picnics in the country every Saturday.
You never let us down.
You were there for us all the time.
Someone I could really rely on.
That's not me.
Right, no one touches that key, have you got that? Don't touch it.
Anyone touches that key, it'll be, well, zap!
Just leave it be and everything will be fine. We'll get out. All of us.
Stuart, Sarah, you're gonna get married, just like I said.
 When time gets sorted out...
 Everybody here forgets what happened.
And don't worry, the thing that you changed will stay changed.
You mean I'll still be alive.
Though I'm meant to be dead.
That's why I haven't done anything with my life.
Why it didn't mean anything.
 Doesn't work like that.
 Rubbish.
I was so useless I couldn't even die properly.
Now it's my fault all this has happened.
 This is my fault.
 No, love.
I'm your dad.
It's my job for it to be my fault.
Her dad? How are you her dad?
How old were you? 12?
 Oh, that's disgusting.
 Jacks, listen.
 This is Rose.
 Rose?
How sick is that?
Did you give my daughter a second-hand name?
How many are there? Do you call them all Rose?
Oh, for God's sake, look. It's the same Rose.
Rose, no!
Everyone, behind me!
I'm the oldest thing in here.
Doctor!
It's cold.
The key's cold.
Oh, my God, he's dead.
This is all my fault.
Both of you, all of you.
The whole world.
This is it. There's nothing we can do. It's the end.
The Doctor really cared about you.
He didn't want you to go through it again. Not if there was another way.
Now there isn't.
What are you talking about?
The car that should have killed me, love.
It's here.
The Doctor worked it out way back but he...
tried to protect me.
Still.
He's not in charge anymore.
I am.
 But you can't.
 Who am I, love?
My daddy.
Jackie, look at her.
She's ours.
Of course.
I'm meant to be dead, Jackie.
You're gonna get rid of me at last.
Don't say that.
For once in your life, trust me. It's got to be done.
You've got to survive 'cause you've got to bring up our daughter.
I never read you those bedtime stories, I never took you on those picnics.
I was never there for you.
You would've been.
But I can do this for you.
I can be a proper dad to you now.
But it's not fair.
I've had all these extra hours.
No one else in the world has ever had that.
And on top of that, I get to see you.
And you're beautiful.
How lucky am I, eh?
So, come on. Do as your dad says.
You gonna be there for me, love?
Thanks for saving me.
Goodbye, love.
Go to him. Quick.
<i>The driver was just a kld.</i> He stopped, he waited for the police.
It wasn't his fault.
For some reason, Pete just ran out.
People say there was this girl.
And she sat with Pete while he was dying.
She held his hand.
Then she was gone.
Never found out who she was.
<i>Peter Alan Tyler, my dad.</i> <i>The most wonderful man In the world.</i> <i>Died 7th November, 1987.</i> 
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
 What's the emergency?
 It's mauve.
Mauve?
Universally recognised colour for danger.
 What happened to red?
 That's just humans.
By everyone else's standards, red's camp.
Oh, the misunderstandings. All those red alerts, all that dancing.
It's got a very basic flight computer I've hacked in, slaved the Tardis.
Wherever it goes, we go.
 And that's safe, is it?
 Totally.
Okay, reasonably. Should have said "reasonably" there.
No. No! It's jumping time tracks, getting away from us.
 What exactly is this thing?
 No idea.
Then why are we chasing it?
It's mauve and dangerous and about 30 seconds from the centre of London.
Know how long you can knock around space without happening to bump into Earth?
 Five days.
 Or is that when we're out of milk?
Of all the species in all the universe and it has to come out of a cow.
Must've come down somewhere quite close. Within a mile anyway.
And it can't have been more than a few weeks ago. Maybe a month.
A month? We were right behind it.
It was jumping time tracks all over the place. We're bound to be a little bit out.
 Do you want to drive?
 Yeah.
 How much is a little?
 A bit.
 Is that exactly a bit?
 Ish.
What's the plan, then?
You going to do a scan for alien tech or something?
Rose, it hit the middle of London with a very loud bang. I'm going to ask.
"Dr John Smith, Ministry of Asteroids." It's psychic paper, it tells you what...
 Whatever you want it to, I remember.
 Sorry.
Not very "Spock", is it? Just asking.
 Door, music, people. What do you think?
 I think you should scan for alien tech.
Give me some Spock, for once. Would it kill you?
You sure about that T-shirt?
Too early to say. I'm taking it out for a spin.
Mummy.
Mummy.
Come on if you're coming. It won't take a minute.
Mummy?
Doctor, there's a kid up there!
<i># For nobody else <i># Gave me the thrill <i># When I uphold silence still <i># It had to be you <i># Wonderful you # Are you all right up there?
Mummy.
<i># It had to be you # Excuse me, could I have everybody's attention just for a mo?
Be very quick. Hello?
Erm... might seem like a stupid question but has anything fallen from the sky recently?
Mummy.
Okay, hang on, don't move.
Sorry, have I said something funny?
It's just there's this thing that I need to find.
Would have fallen from the sky, a couple of days ago.
Would have landed quite near here.
With a very loud...
Quickly as you can, down to the shelter.
... bang.
Mummy.
Balloon.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Okay. Maybe not this T-shirt.
Rose?
You know, one day.
Just one day, maybe, I'm going to meet somebody who gets the whole "don't wander off" thing.
900 years of phone box travel, it's the only thing left to surprise me.
How can you be ringing?
What's that about ringing?
What am I supposed to do with a ringing phone?
Don't answer it. It's not for you.
 And how do you know that?
 'Cause I do. And I'm telling you.
Don't answer it.
Well, if you know so much, tell me this, how can it be ringing?
It's not even a real phone, it's not connected, it's not...
Hello?
This is the Doctor speaking.
 How may I help you? <i>- Mummy?</i> <i>Mummy?</i> Who is this? Who's speaking?
<i>Are you my mummy?</i>  Who is this? <i>- Mummy.</i> How did you ring it? This isn't a real phone, it's not wired up to...
<i>Mummy?</i> Rose?
Rose, are you in there?
The planes are coming, can't you hear them? Into the shelter.
None of your nonsense, now move it.
Come on. Hurry up, get in there. Come on.
Arthur, will you hurry up?
Didn't you hear the siren?
Middle of dinner, every night. Blooming Germans, don't they eat?
I can hear the planes.
Don't you eat?
Keep your voice down, will you? It's an air raid.
 Get in, look, there's a war on.
 I know there's a war on, don't push me.
Get those lights out, please. Everyone down to the shelter.
Jack? You going down to the shelter?
Only I've got to go off on some damn silly guard duty.
Barrage balloon? Must've come loose. Happens now and then.
Don't you RAF boys use them for target practice?
Excellent bottom.
I say, old man, there's a time and a place.
Look, you should really be off.
Sorry, old man.
I've got to go meet a girl. But you've got an excellent bottom, too.
 Many kids out there?
 Yes, miss.
Still carving. Sit and wait.
Got the whole air raid.
 Look. Bet it's off the black market.
 That's enough.
 <i>Okay, I got you.</i>   Who's got me?
Who's got me and how?
<i>I'm just programming</i> <i>your descent pattern.</i> <i>Stay as still as you can and keep your</i> <i>hands and feet inside the light fleld.</i> Descent pattern?
<i>And can you switch off your cell phone?</i> <i>No, seriously,</i> <i>It Interferes with my Instruments.</i> No one ever believes that.
<i>Thank you, that's much better.</i> Yeah, that's a real load off, that is.
I'm hanging in the sky in the middle of a German air raid with a Union Jack across my chest but, hey, my mobile phone's off.
<i>Be with you In a moment.</i> <i>The mobile device indicates</i> <i>non-contemporaneous Ilfe-form.</i> She's not from round here, no.
Ready for you. Hold tight.
 To what?
 Fair point.
I got you. You're fine, you're just fine.
The tractor beam, it can scramble your head just a little.
 Hello.
 Hello.
Hello.
Sorry. There was "hello" twice there. Dull but, you know, thorough.
 Are you all right?
 Fine.
Why, you expecting me to faint or something?
You look a little dizzy.
What about you? You're not even in focus.
It's got to be black market. You couldn't get all this on coupons.
Ernie, how many times? We are guests in this house.
We will not make comments of that kind. Washing up.
Oh, Nancy.
 Haven't seen you at one of these before.
 He told me about it.
 Sleeping rough?
 Yes, miss.
All right, then.
One slice each. And I want to see everybody chewing properly.
 Thank you, miss.
 Thanks, miss.
Thank you, miss.
Thanks, miss.
It's all right. Everybody stay where they are.
Good here, isn't it? Who's got the salt?
Back in your seats. He shouldn't be here either.
 So, you lot, what's the story?
 What do you mean?
 You're homeless, right? Living rough?
 Why do you want to know that?
You a copper?
I'm not a copper. What's a copper going to do with you lot anyway?
Arrest you for starving?
I make it 1941. You lot shouldn't even be in London.
Should've been evacuated to the country by now.
I was evacuated. Sent me to a farm.
 So why'd you come back?
 There was a man there.
Yeah. Same with Ernie. Two homes ago.
Shut up. It's better on the streets anyway. It's better food.
Yeah. Nancy always gets the best food for us.
 So that's what you do, is it, Nancy?
 What is?
Soon as the sirens go, you find a big, fat family meal, still warm on the table, with everyone down in the air raid shelter and bingo.
Feeding frenzy for the homeless kids of London town.
Puddings for all, as long as the bombs don't get you.
 Something wrong with that?
 Wrong? It's brilliant.
I'm not sure if it's Marxism in action or a West End musical.
Why'd you follow me? What do you want?
I want to know how a phone that isn't a phone gets a phone call.
 You seem to be the one to ask.
 I did you a favour.
I told you not to answer it. That's all I'm telling you.
Great, thanks. And I want to find a blonde in a Union Jack.
I mean, a specific one, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving.
Anybody seen a girl like that?
 What have I done wrong?
 You took two slices.
No blondes, no flags.
 Anything else before you leave?
 There is, actually. Thanks for asking.
Something I've been looking for.
Would've fallen from the sky a month ago, but not a bomb.
Not the usual kind anyway. Wouldn't have exploded.
Probably would've buried itself in the ground somewhere.
And it would've looked something like this.
Mummy? Are you in there, Mummy?
Mummy.
 Who was the last one in?
 Him.
He came round the back. Who came in the front?
 Me.
 Did you close the door?
Did you close the door?
Mummy. Mummy.
Mummy.
What's this, then?
Never easy being the only child left out in the cold, you know.
 I suppose you'd know.
 I do, actually, yes.
It's not exactly a child.
Mummy.
Everybody out. Across the back garden, under the fence.
Now. Go. Move.
Come on, baby, we've got to go. It's just like a game, just like chasing.
Take your coat. Go on.
Go.
Mummy. Mummy.
Please let me in, Mummy.
Please let me in, Mummy.
You all right?
Please let me in.
 You mustn't let him touch you.
 What happens if he touches me?
 He makes you like him.
 And what's he like?
 I've got to go.
 Nancy, what's he like?
He's empty.
It's him.
He can make phones ring. He can. Just like with that police box you saw.
<i>Are you my mummy?</i> <i>Mummy?</i> <i>Mummy?</i> <i>Please let me In, Mummy.</i> <i>Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.</i> You stay here if you want to.
<i>Mummy. Mummy. Mummy...</i> Mummy.
Let me in, please, Mummy.
 Please let me in.
 Your mummy isn't here.
 Are you my mummy?
 No mummies here.
Nobody here but us chickens.
Well. This chicken.
I'm scared.
Why are those other children frightened of you?
Please let me in, Mummy. I'm scared of the bombs.
Okay. I'm opening the door now.
 Better now?
 You got lights in here?
 Hello.
 Hello.
Hello.
 Let's not start that again.
 Okay.
So, who are you supposed be, then?
Captain Jack Harkness, 133 Squadron, Royal Air Force.
American volunteer.
Liar. This is psychic paper.
It tells me whatever you want it to tell me.
 How do you know?
 Two things.
One, I have a friend that uses this all the time and two, you just handed me a piece of paper telling me you're single and you work out.
 Tricky thing, psychic paper.
 Yeah.
Can't let your mind wander when you're handing it over.
You sort of have a boyfriend called Mickey Smith but you consider yourself to be footloose and fancy free.
 What?
 Actually the word you use is "available".
 No way.
 And another one, "very".
Shall we try and get along without the psychic paper?
That would be better, wouldn't it?
 Nice spaceship.
 Gets me around.
Very... Spock.
Who?
Guessing you're not a local boy, then?
A cell phone, a liquid crystal watch and fabrics that won't be around for at least another two decades.
 Guessing you're not a local girl.
 Guessing right.
 Burn your hands on the rope?
 Yeah.
We're parked in midair. Can't anyone down there see us?
No. Can I have a look at your hands for a moment?
 Why?
 Please.
You can stop acting now. I know exactly who you are.
 I can spot a Time Agent a mile away.
 A Time Agent?
I've been expecting one of you guys to show up.
Though not, I must to say, by barrage balloon.
Do you often travel that way?
Sometimes I get swept off my feet.
By balloons.
 What are you doing?
 Try to keep still.
Nanogenes, subatomic robots. The air in here is full of them.
They just repaired three layers of your skin.
Tell them thanks.
 Shall we get down to business?
 Business?
Shall we have a drink on the balcony?
Bring up the glasses.
I know I'm standing on something.
 Okay. You have an invisible spaceship.
 Yeah.
Tethered up to Big Ben for some reason.
First rule of active camouflage. Park somewhere you'll remember.
How'd you follow me here?
I'm good at following, me. I've got the nose for it.
People can't usually follow me if I don't want them to.
 My nose has special powers.
 Yeah? Is that why it's so...
 What?
 Nothing.
 What?
 Nothing.
 Your ears have special powers, too?
 What are you trying to say?
Good night, mister.
Nancy.
There's something chasing you and the other kids.
It looks like a boy and it isn't a boy.
And it started about a month ago. Right?
The thing I'm looking for.
The thing that fell from the sky. That's when it landed.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
There was a bomb. A bomb that wasn't a bomb.
Fell the other end of Limehouse Green Station.
 Take me there.
 No. Soldiers guarding it. Barbed wire.
 You'd never get through.
 Try me.
You sure you want to know what's going on in there?
I really want to know.
Then there's someone you need to talk to first.
 And who might that be?
 The Doctor.
It's getting a bit late. I should really be getting back.
We're discussing business.
This isn't business, this is champagne.
I try never to discuss business with a clear head.
Are you travelling alone?
 Are you authorised to negotiate?
 What would we be negotiating?
I have something for the Time Agency. Something they'd like to buy.
Are you empowered to make payment?
Well, I should talk to my companion.
 Your companion?
 I should really be getting back to him.
 Him?
 Do you have the time?
Okay. That was flash.
That was on the flash side.
So, when you say your companion...
just how disappointed should I be?
 Okay, we're standing in midair...
 Uh-huh.
... on a spaceship, during a German air raid.
Do you really think now's a good time to be coming on to me?
Perhaps not.
It was just a suggestion.
Do you like Glenn Miller?
It's 1941. The height of the London Blitz.
The height of the German bombing campaign.
And something else has fallen on London.
A fully equipped Chula warship.
The last one in existence armed to the teeth.
And I know where it is because I parked it.
If the agency can name the right price, I can get it for you.
But in two hours...
a German bomb is going to fall on it and destroy it forever.
That's your deadline. That's the deal.
Now, shall we discuss payment?
 You know what I think?
 What?
I think you were talking just there.
Two hours. The bomb falls. There'll be nothing left but dust and a crater.
Promises, promises.
Are you listening to any of this?
You used to be a Time Agent, now you're some kind of freelancer.
It's a little harsh. I like to think of myself as a criminal.
I'll bet you do.
So this companion of yours, does he handle the business?
Well, I delegate a lot of that, yeah.
Maybe we should go find him.
 And how you going to do that?
 Easy, I'll do a scan for alien tech.
Finally a professional.
 The bomb's under the tarpaulin.
 They put the fence up overnight.
See that building? The hospital?
 What about it?
 That's where the Doctor is.
You should talk to him.
For now, I'm more interested in getting in there.
 Talk to the Doctor first.
 Why?
Because then maybe you won't want to get inside.
Where you going?
There was a lot of food in that house. I've got mouths to feed.
Should be safe enough now.
Can I ask you a question?
 Who did you lose?
 What?
The way you look after all those kids. It's 'cause you lost somebody, isn't it?
You're doing all this to make up for it.
My little brother. Jamie.
One night I went out looking for food. Same night that thing fell.
Told him not to follow me. I told him it was dangerous. But he just...
He just didn't like being on his own.
What happened?
In the middle of an air raid? What do you think happened?
 Amazing.
 What is?
1941. Right now, not very far from here the German war machine is rolling up the map of Europe.
Country after country, falling like dominoes. Nothing can stop it, nothing.
Until one tiny, damp, little island says "no".
No, not here.
A mouse in front of a lion.
You're amazing. The lot of you.
Don't know what you do to Hitler, but you frighten the hell out of me.
Off you go, then. Do what you got to do. Save the world.
You'll find them everywhere. In every bed, in every ward.
Hundreds of them.
Yes, I saw. Why are they still wearing gas masks?
 They're not. Who are you?
 I'm...
 Are you the Doctor?
 Dr Constantine. And you are?
 Nancy sent me.
 Nancy?
That means you must have been asking about the bomb.
Yes.
What do you know about it?
Nothing. Why I was asking. What do you know?
Only what it's done.
These people were all caught up in the blast?
None of them were.
You're very sick.
Dying, I should think. I just haven't been able to find the time.
 Are you a doctor?
 I have my moments.
 Have you examined any of them yet?
 No.
Don't touch the flesh.
 Which one?
 Any one.
Conclusions?
Massive head trauma, mostly to the left side.
Partial collapse of the chest cavity, mostly to the right.
There's scarring on the back of the hand and the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh, but I can't see any burns.
Examine another one.
 This is impossible.
 Examine another.
 This is impossible.
 No.
 They've all got the same injuries.
 Yes.
 Exactly the same.
 Yes.
Identical, all of them, right down to the scar on the back of the hand.
How did this happen? How did it start?
When that bomb dropped, there was just one victim.
 Dead?
 At first.
His injuries were truly dreadful.
By the following morning every doctor and nurse who had treated him, who had touched him, had those exact same injuries.
By the next morning, every patient on the same ward, the exact same injuries.
Within a week, the entire hospital.
Physical injuries as plague.
Can you explain that?
What would you say was the cause of death?
 The head trauma.
 No.
 Asphyxiation?
 No.
 The collapse of the chest cavity.
 No.
All right, what was the cause of death?
There wasn't one.
They're not dead.
It's all right, they are harmless.
They just sort of sit there.
No heartbeat. No life signs of any kind.
They just don't die.
And they've just been left here. Nobody's doing anything?
I try and make them comfortable. What else is there?
Just you? You're the only one here.
Before this war began I was a father and a grandfather.
Now I'm neither. But I'm still a doctor.
Yeah. I know the feeling.
I suspect the plan is to blow up the hospital and blame it on a German bomb.
 Probably too late.
 I know.
There are isolated cases.
Isolated cases breaking out all over London.
Stay back.
Listen to me. Top floor.
Room 802.
That's where they took the first victim. The one from the crash site.
 And you must find Nancy again.
 Nancy?
It was her brother.
She knows more than she's saying. She won't tell me, but she...
Mummy.
Are you my...
mummy?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Good evening. Hope we're not interrupting.
Jack Harkness. I've been hearing all about you on the way over.
He knows, I had to tell him. About us being Time Agents.
And it's a real pleasure to meet you, Mr Spock.
Mr Spock?
What was I supposed to say? You don't have a name.
Don't you ever get tired of "Doctor"? Doctor who?
Nine centuries in, I'm coping. Where've you been?
We're in the middle of a London Blitz, not the time for a stroll.
Who's strolling? I went by barrage balloon.
 Only way to see an air raid.
 What?
Listen, what's a Chula warship?
Chula?
<i>Please, Mummy. Please let me In.</i> <i>I'm scared of the bombs, Mummy.</i> <i>Please, Mummy.</i> Mummy.
Mummy.
This just isn't possible. How did this happen?
 What kind of Chula ship landed here?
 What?
He said it was a warship.
He stole it, parked it somewhere out there.
Somewhere a bomb's gonna fall on it. Unless we make him an offer.
 What kind of warship?
 Does it matter?
It has nothing to do with this.
This started at the bomb site. It's got everything to do with it.
 What kind of warship?
 An ambulance.
Look. That's what you chased through the time vortex.
It's space junk, I wanted to kid you it was valuable, it's empty.
I made sure of it, nothing but a shell.
I threw it at you.
Saw your time travel vehicle, love the retro look by the way,  nice panels, threw you the bait...
 Bait?
I wanted to sell it to you, then destroy it before you found it was junk.
 You said it was a warship.
 They have ambulances in wars.
It's a con. I was conning you.
That's what I am, I'm a con man. Thought you were Time Agents.
 You're not, are you?
 Just a couple more freelancers.
Oh! Should've known, the way you guys are blending in with the local colour.
Flag Girl was bad enough, but U-boat Captain?
Anyway, whatever's happening here has got nothing to do with that ship.
What is happening here, Doctor?
Human DNA is being rewritten.
 By an idiot.
 What do you mean?
I don't know, some kind of virus. Converting humans into these things.
But why? What's the point?
Mummy.
Where's my mummy?
Mummy.
Are you my mummy?
Mummy.
Mummy.
Mummy.
 What's happening?
 I don't know.
Mummy.
It's me. Nancy.
Don't let them touch you.
 What happens if they touch us?
 You're looking at it.
 Are you my mummy?
 It's Nancy, your sister.
You're dead, Jamie. You're dead.
Mummy.
Mummy.
Mummy. Mummy...
 Mummy.
 Mummy.
Mummy...
I don't know what's happening but I had nothing to do with it.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
And why are we chasing it?
It's mauve and dangerous, and about 30 seconds from the centre of London.
Excuse me, there's this thing that I need to find.
Would've fallen from the sky.
Nancy, the thing I'm looking for, you know what I'm talking about, don't you?
I've got you, you're fine.
 Hello.
 Hello.
Jack Harkness, I've been hearing all about you on the way over.
It's 1941, the height of the London Blitz, and something else has fallen on London.
He said it was a warship, he stole it.
Parked it somewhere, somewhere a bomb's going to fall on it, unless we make him an offer.
It's a con. I was conning you. That's what I am. I'm a con man.
Mummy.
There's something chasing you and the other kids.
Mummy. Mummy!
You mustn't let him touch you.
 What happens if he touches me?
 He makes you like him.
Right, everybody out, across the back garden, under the fence. Now, go, move!
You'll find them everywhere, in every bed in every ward.
Hundreds of them.
They've all got the same injuries, scarring on the back of the hand, and the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh.
 What was the cause of death?
 They're not dead.
Are you my mummy?
It's me Nancy!
 Don't let them touch you.
 What happens if they touch us?
You're looking at it.
Mummy. Mummy...
Go to your room.
Go to your room.
I mean it, I'm very, very angry with you.
I'm very, very cross.
Go to your room!
Subtitles downloaded from www. OpenSubtitles. org I'm really glad that worked.
Those would have been terrible last words.
Jamie.
 Why are they all wearing gas masks?
 They're not.
Those masks are flesh and bone.
 How was your con supposed to work?
 Simple enough, really.
Find some harmless piece of space junk, let the nearest Time Agent track it back to Earth, convince him it's valuable and name a price.
When he's put 50% upfront... oops!
German bomb falls on it, destroys it forever.
He never gets to see what he's paid for, never knows he's been had.
I buy him a drink with his own money and we discuss dumb luck.
 The perfect self-cleaning con.
 Yeah. Perfect.
The London Blitz is great for self-cleaners.
Pompeii's nice if you want to make a vacation of it, though.
But you've got to set your alarm for Volcano Day.
 Getting a hint of disapproval.
 Take a look around the room.
This is what your piece of harmless space junk did.
It was a burnt-out medical transporter, it was empty.
Rose.
 Are we getting out of here?
 We're going upstairs.
I programmed the flight computer so it wouldn't land on anything living.
I harmed no one!
I don't know what's happening here but I had nothing to do with it.
I'll tell you what's happening.
You forgot to set your alarm clock. It's Volcano Day.
 What's that?
 The all clear.
I wish.
I thought you were Jamie.
 Dad! Dad!
 Ruddy kids!
 Get off of me!
 Give us a hand.
 Get your hands off me now!
 You! Get in!
Get her in there. She's nicked!
 Mr Spock?
 Doctor.
Have you got a blaster?
Sure.
The night your space junk landed, someone was hurt.
 This is where they were taken.
 What happened?
Let's find out. Get it open.
 What's up with your sonic screwdriver?
 Nothing.
Sonic blaster, 51 st century. Weapon factories of Villengard.
 You've been to the factories?
 Once.
They're gone now, destroyed. Main reactor went critical, vaporized the lot.
Like I said. Once.
There's a banana grove there now. I like bananas. Bananas are good.
 Nice blast pattern.
 Digital.
 Squareness gun? I like it.
 Yeah.
 What do you think?
 Something got out of here.
Yeah. And?
Something powerful. Angry.
Powerful and angry.
A child?
 I suppose this explains "mummy".
 How could a child do this?
<i>- Do you know where you are?
 Are you my mummy?</i> <i>Are you aware of what's around you?</i> <i>Can you... see?</i> <i>Are you my mummy?</i> <i>- What do you want? Do you know...
 I want my mummy!</i> <i>Are you my mummy? I want my mummy.</i> <i>Are you my mummy?</i> <i>Are you my mummy?</i> <i>Mummy? Mummy?</i>  Doctor, I've heard this voice before.
 Me, too.
<i>Mummy?</i> Always "are you my mummy?" Like he doesn't know.
<i>Mummy.</i> Why doesn't he know?
<i>Are you there, Mummy? Mummy?</i> The police are on their way.
I pay for the food on this table.
The sweat on my brow, that food is. The sweat on my brow.
Anything else you'd like? I've got a whole house here.
Anything else you'd like to help yourself to?
Yeah.
I'd like some wire cutters, please.
Something that can cut through barbed wire.
Oh, and a torch. Don't look like that, Mr Lloyd.
I know you got plenty of tools in here. I been watching this house for ages.
And I'd like another look round your kitchen cupboards.
I was in a hurry the first time. I want to see if there's anything I missed.
The food on this table...
It's an awful lot of food, isn't it, Mr Lloyd?
A lot more than on anyone else's table.
Half this street thinks your missus must be messing about with Mr Haverstock, the butcher.
But she's not, is she?
You are. Wire cutters. Torch. Food.
And I'd like to use your bathroom before I leave, please.
Oh, look! There's the sweat on your brow.
<i>Mummy? Please, Mummy. Mummy?</i> Doctor?
 Can you sense it?
 Sense what?
Coming out of the walls. Can you feel it?
Funny little human brains. How do you get around in those things?
When he's stressed, he likes to insult species.
 Rose, I'm thinking!
 He cuts himself shaving.
He does half an hour on life-forms he's cleverer than.
There are these children. Living rough round the bomb sites.
They come out during air raids, looking for food.
<i>Mummy, please.</i> Suppose they were there when this thing, whatever it was, landed.
 It was a med-ship, it was harmless.
 You keep saying. Harmless.
 Suppose one was affected. Altered.
 Altered how?
<i>I'm here!</i> It's afraid, terribly afraid and powerful.
It doesn't know it yet. But it will do.
It's got the power of a god and I just sent it to its room.
Doctor.
<i>I'm here! Can't you see me?</i> What's that noise?
End of the tape. It ran out about 30 seconds ago.
<i>I'm here now! Can't you see me?</i> I sent it to its room. This is its room.
Are you my mummy?
Mummy?
Doctor?
Okay, on my signal make for the door.
 Mummy?
 Now!
Mummy?
 Go, now, don't drop the banana!
 Why not?
Good source of potassium.
Give me that.
Mummy? I want my mummy.
Digital rewind. Nice switch.
It's from the groves of Villengard, thought it was appropriate.
There's really a banana grove in Villengard? And you did that?
Bananas are good.
 Doctor!
 Come on!
Mummy! Mummy!
It's keeping us here till it can get at us.
 It's controlling them?
 It is them.
It's every living thing in this hospital.
Okay. This can function as a sonic blaster, a sonic cannon and it's a triple-enfolded sonic disruptor.
 Doc, what you got?
 I've got a sonic... Never mind.
 What?
 It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that.
Disruptor? Cannon? What?
It's sonic, totally sonic. I am soniced up.
 A sonic what?
 Screwdriver!
Going down.
Doctor, are you okay?
 Could've used a warning.
 The gratitude.
 Who has a sonic screwdriver?
 I do.
Lights?
Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks, "Ooh, this could be more sonic?"  You've never been bored?
 There's got to be a light switch.
Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?
 Mummy.
 Mummy.
Door.
 Damn it!
 Mummy?
It's the special features, they really drain the battery.
The battery?
It's so lame.
I was going to send for another one but somebody's got to blow up the factory.
I know. First day I met him, he blew my job up.
That's practically how he communicates.
Okay, that door should hold it for a bit.
 The door? The wall didn't stop it.
 It's got to find us first!
Come on, we're not done yet. Assets.
I've got a banana and, in a pinch, you could put up some shelves.
 Window?
 Barred. Sheer drop. Seven storeys.
And no other exits.
The assets conversation went in a flash, didn't it?
 Where'd you pick this one up, then?
 Doctor.
She was hanging from a barrage balloon, I had an invisible spaceship.
I never stood a chance.
Okay. One, we've got to get out of here.
Two, we can't get out of here. Have I missed anything?
Yeah. Jack just disappeared.
I thought as much. What are all of you doing here?
Different house every night I told you.
We thought you were dead. Or you'd run off.
I didn't. I knew you'd come back for us.
Found that old thing in the junk.
 Thinks he's can write now.
 Writing a letter to me dad.
You don't even know where your dad is. How you gonna send it?
 I don't know, stick it in an envelope.
 You can't even read or write.
I don't need to, I've got a machine.
Will you stop making that noise?
I'm sorry, Jim.
On you go, you write a letter to your dad if you want to.
I know we should have went somewhere else but we need you, see, for the thinking.
What if I wasn't here?
What if one night I didn't come back for you?
There's a war on, people go out.
They don't always come back. It happens.
What would you do then?
They're wire cutters.
I need you to think about that.
 Someone's got to look after this lot.
 Why? Are you going somewhere?
The bomb site. The one at the railway station.
 Why?
 The child.
That's where he was killed.
That's where it all started. And I'm gonna find out how.
 He'll get you.
 And then he'll come for us.
 He always comes for us.
 No, Ernie, he doesn't.
He always comes after me.
There are things I haven't told you. Things I can't tell you.
As long as you're with me, you're in danger.
Even right now. Sitting here. You're in danger because of me.
You're the one that keeps us safe.
You think so, Ernie? Then answer this.
Jim is sitting there right next to you.
So who's typing?
Is he coming?
Ernie, as long as you're with me, he's always coming.
Plenty of greens. And chew your food.
Okay, so he's vanished into thin air.
Why is it always the great-looking ones who do that?
 I'm making an effort not to be insulted.
 I mean, men.
Okay, thanks, that really helped.
<i>Rose? Doctor? Can you hear me?</i> Back on my ship.
Used the emergency teleport. Sorry I couldn't take you.
<i>It's security-keyed to my molecular structure.</i> I'm working on it, hang in there.
How are you speaking to us?
<i>Om-Com. I can call anything with a speaker grill.</i> <i>- Now there's a coincidence.
 What is?</i>  The child can Om-Com, too.
 He can?
Anything with a speaker grill. Even the Tardis phone.
What, you mean the child can phone us?
<i>And I can hear you. Coming to find you.</i> <i>Coming to find you.</i> <i>- Doctor, can you hear that?
 Loud and clear.</i> I'll try to block out the signal. Least I can do.
<i>Coming to find you, Mummy.</i> Remember this one, Rose?
Our song.
What you doing?
Trying to set up a resonation pattern in the concrete, loosen the bars.
 Do you think he's coming back?
 Wouldn't bet my life.
Why don't you trust him?
 Why do you?
 Saved my life.
Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing.
I trust him because he's like you. Except with dating and dancing.
 What?
 You just assume I'm...
 What?
 You just assume I don't dance.
What? Are you telling me you do dance?
900 years old, me. I've been around a bit.
I think you can assume at some point I've danced.
 You?
 Problem?
Doesn't the universe implode or something if you dance?
Well, I've got the moves but I wouldn't want to boast.
You've got the moves? Show me your moves.
Rose, I'm trying to resonate concrete.
Jack will be back. He'll get us out. So come on.
The world doesn't end because the Doctor dances.
 Barrage balloon?
 What?
You were hanging from a barrage balloon.
Oh. Yeah. About two minutes after you left me.
Thousands of feet above London, middle of a German air raid, Union Jack all over my chest.
I've travelled with a lot of people but you're setting new records for jeopardy friendly.
Is this you dancing? Because I've got notes.
Hanging from a rope, thousands of feet above London.
Not a cut, not a bruise.
Yeah, I know. Captain Jack fixed me up.
We're calling him Captain Jack now, are we?
His name's Jack and he's a captain.
 He's not really a captain, Rose.
 Do you know what I think?
I think you're experiencing captain-envy.
You will find your feet at the end of your legs.
You may care to move them.
If ever he was a captain, he's been defrocked.
 Yeah? Shame I missed that.
 Actually, I quit.
Nobody takes my frock.
Most people notice when they've been teleported.
You guys are so sweet.
Sorry about the delay.
Had to take the Nav-Com off-line to override the teleport security.
You can spend 10 minutes overriding your own protocols.
Maybe you should remember whose ship it is.
I do. She was gorgeous.
Like I told her, be back in five minutes.
 This is a Chula ship.
 Yeah, just like that medical transporter.
Only this one is dangerous.
They're what fixed up my hands up. Jack called them...
 Nanobots? Nanogenes?
 Nanogenes, yeah.
Subatomic robots. There are millions of them in here. See?
Burned my hand on the console when we landed. All better now.
They activate when the bulkhead's sealed.
Check you out for damage, fix any physical flaws.
Take us to the crash site. I need to see your space junk.
Soon as I get the Nav-Com back online. Make yourself comfortable.
Carry on with whatever it was you were doing.
 We were talking about dancing.
 It didn't look like talking.
Didn't feel like dancing.
Halt! Don't move!
So, you used to be a Time Agent and now you're trying to con them?
If it makes me sound any better, it's not for the money.
For what?
Woke up one morning when I was still working for them, found they'd stolen two years of my memories.
 I'd like them back.
 They stole your memories?
Two years of my life. No idea what I did.
Your friend over there doesn't trust me. And for all I know, he's right not to.
Okay. We're good to go. The crash site?
 As you were. You feeling any better?
 Just a touch, sir.
Chain her up where Jenkins can keep an eye on her.
No. Not in here. Not with him.
You shouldn't have broken in here if you didn't want to stay.
You don't understand. Not with him.
This is a restricted area, miss.
You can just sit here for a bit.
We're going to have to ask you a few questions.
Found these, sir.
Very professional, a little bit too professional.
Didn't just drop in by accident then, did you?
My little brother died here.
I wanted to find out what killed him.
Take the men, check the fence for any other breaches.
And search the area, she may not have come here alone.
 Yes, sir!
 Please.
Listen, you can't leave me here.
 Watch her, Jenkins.
 Yes, Mummy.
 Jenkins?
 Sorry.
Sir, I don't know what's the matter with me.
Look, lock me up, fine, but not here. Please, anywhere but here.
You'll be all right, miss. I'm just a little...
Just a little...
What's the matter with you?
 Please, let me go.
 Why would I do that?
Because you've got a scar on the back of your hand.
Yes, but I don't see what that's got to do with anything.
You feel like you're gonna be sick.
Like something's forcing its way up your throat.
I know because I've seen it before.
 What's happening to me?
 In a minute you won't be you anymore.
You won't even remember you.
And unless you let me go, it's going to happen to me, too.
 Please.
 What are you talking about?
 What's your mother's name?
 Matilda.
 You got a wife?
 Yes.
Wife's name?
You got kids? What's your name?
Please, let me go. It's too late for you. I'm sorry.
But please let me go.
What...
Mummy!
There it is.
They've got Algy on duty. Must be important.
We've got to get past him.
Are the words "distract the guard" heading in my general direction?
I don't think that'd be such a good idea.
Don't worry, I can handle it.
I've got to know Algy quite well since I've been in town.
Trust me, you're not his type.
I'll distract him.
Don't wait up.
Relax. He's a 51 st century guy.
He's just a bit more flexible when it comes to dancing.
How flexible?
By his time, you lot are spread out across half the galaxy.
 Meaning?
 So many species, so little time.
What, that's what we do when we get out there?
That's our mission? We seek new life and...
Dance.
Hey, tiger. How's it hanging?
 Mummy?
 Algy, old sport, it's me.
 Mummy?
 It's me, Jack.
Jack?
Are you my mummy?
Stay back! You men, stay away.
The effect's becoming airborne, accelerating.
 What's keeping us safe?
 Nothing.
 Here they come again.
 All we need.
Didn't you say a bomb was gonna land here?
Never mind about that.
If the contaminant's airborne now, there's hours left.
 Till what?
 Till nothing.
Forever. For the entire human race.
And can anyone else hear singing?
#... the tree tops # When the wind blows the cradle will rock # When the bow breaks the cradle will fall # Down will come baby cradle and all # Rock-a-bye baby on the tree tops # When the wind blows the cradle will rock # You see? Just an ambulance.
That's an ambulance?
It's hard to explain. It's from another world.
 They've been trying to get in.
 Of course they have.
They think they've got their hands on Hitler's latest secret weapon.
 What are you doing?
 The sooner you see this thing's empty, the sooner you'll know I had nothing to do with it.
Didn't happen last time.
It hadn't crashed last time. There'll be emergency protocols.
Doctor, what is that?
Mummy.
Doctor!
 Captain, secure those gates.
 Why?
Just do it!
Nancy, how did you get in here?
 I cut the wire.
 Show Rose.
Setting 2,428-D.
 What?
 Reattaches barbed wire. Go!
Who are you? Who are any of you?
Never believe me if I told you.
You just told me that was an ambulance from another world.
There are people running round with gas masks calling for their mummies and the sky's full of Germans dropping bombs on me.
Tell me, do you think there's anything left I couldn't believe?
We're time travellers. From the future.
 Mad, you are!
 We have a time travel machine.
It's not that. All right, you got a time travel machine.
I'll believe you. Believe anything, me.
But what future?
Nancy, this isn't the end.
I know how it looks, it's not the end of the world or anything.
How can you say that? Look at it.
Listen to me. I was born in this city.
I'm from here, in like 50 years' time.
 From here?
 I'm a Londoner.
 From your future.
 But...
 But you're not...
 What?
 German?
 Nancy.
The Germans don't come here. They don't win.
Don't tell anyone I told you so. But you know what?
 You win.
 We win?
Come on.
It's empty. Look at it.
What do you expect in a Chula medical transporter?
Bandages? Cough drops?
 Rose?
 I don't know.
 Yes, you do.
 Nanogenes!
It wasn't empty, Captain.
There was enough nanogenes in there to rebuild a species.
 Oh, God.
 Getting it now, are we?
When the ship crashes, the nanogenes escape.
Billions upon billions of them.
Ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the whole world.
But what they find first is a dead child.
Probably killed earlier that night. And wearing a gas mask.
And they brought him back to life? They can do that?
What's life? Life's easy. A quirk of matter.
Nature's way of keeping meat fresh. Nothing to a nanogene.
One problem, though.
These nanogenes, they're not like the ones on your ship.
This lot have never seen a human being before.
Don't know what a human being's supposed to look like.
All they've got to go on is one little body, and there's not a lot left.
But they carry right on.
They do what they're programmed to, they patch it up.
Can't tell what's gas mask and what's skull, but they do their best.
And then off they fly, off they go, work to be done.
'Cause you see, now they think they know what people should look like.
And it's time to fix all the rest. And they won't ever stop.
They won't ever stop.
The entire human race is gonna be torn down and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child looking for its mother.
 And nothing in the world can stop it!
 I didn't know.
Mummy.
Rose?
Mummy. Mummy...
It's bringing the gas mask people here, isn't it?
The ship thinks it's under attack. It's calling up the troops. Standard protocol.
But the gas mask people aren't troops!
They are now. This is a battlefield ambulance.
The nanogenes don't just fix you up, they get you ready for the front line.
 Equip you, programme you.
 That's why the child's so strong?
 Why it could do that phoning thing?
 It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes.
All that weapons tech in the hands of an hysterical four-year-old looking for his mummy and now there's an army of them.
Mummy. Mummy.
Why don't they attack?
Good little soldiers. Waiting for their commander.
The child?
 Jamie.
 What?
Not the child. Jamie.
 So how long until the bomb falls?
 Any second.
What's the matter, Captain? Bit close to the volcano for you?
 He's just a little boy.
 I know.
 He's just a boy who wants his mummy.
 I know.
There isn't a little boy born who wouldn't tear the world apart to save his mummy.
 And this little boy can.
 So what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
 It's my fault.
 No.
 It is. It's all my fault.
 How can it be your...
Mummy. Mummy.
 Mummy  Mummy!
Mummy!
Nancy, what age are you?
20? 21? Older than you look, yes?
Doctor, that bomb, we've got seconds.
 You can teleport us out.
 Not you guys.
The Nav-Com's back online.
Gonna take too long to override the protocols.
So it's Volcano Day. Do what you've got to do.
Jack?
How old were you five years ago? 15? 16?
Old enough to give birth, anyway.
He's not your brother, is he?
A teenage single mother in 1941.
So you hid. You lied.
You even lied to him.
Are you my mummy?
He's gonna keep asking, Nancy.
 He's never gonna stop.
 Mummy.
Tell him.
Nancy, the future of the human race is in your hands.
Trust me and tell him.
Are you my mummy?
Are you my mummy?
Are you my mummy?
 Yes, I am your mummy.
 Mummy?
 I'm here.
 Are you my mummy?
I'm here.
 Are you my mummy?
 Yes.
Are you my mummy?
He doesn't understand, there's not enough of him left.
I am your mummy. I will always be your mummy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
What's happening?
 Doctor, it's changing her, we should...
 Shh!
Come on. Please!
Come on, you clever little nanogenes. Figure it out.
The mother, she's the mother.
It's got to be enough information. Figure it out.
 What's happening?
 See?
Recognising the same DNA.
Come on. Give me a day like this.
Give me this one.
Welcome back! 20 years to pop music, you're gonna love it.
What happened?
The nanogenes recognised the superior information. The parent DNA.
They didn't change you because you changed them.
 Mother knows best.
 Jamie.
 Doctor, that bomb.
 Taken care of it.
 How?
 Psychology.
 Doctor!
 Good lad.
The bomb's already started detonation. I've put it in stasis, but it won't last!
Change of plan! Don't need the bomb. Can you get rid of it, safely as you can?
 Rose?
 Yeah?
Goodbye.
By the way. Love the T-shirt!
 What are you doing?
 Software patch.
Gonna email the upgrade. You want moves, Rose.
I'll give you moves.
Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once!
Everybody lives!
Dr Constantine, who never left his patients.
Back on your feet, constant doctor.
World doesn't want to get by without you just yet and I don't blame it one bit.
These are your patients. All better now.
Yes, so it seems.
They also seem to be standing around in a disused railway station.
Is there any particular reason for that?
Yeah, well, you know, cutbacks.
Listen, whatever was wrong with them in the past you're probably gonna find that they're cured.
Just tell them what a great doctor you are, don't make a big thing of it. Okay?
Dr Constantine.
Mrs Harcourt! How much better you're looking!
My leg's grown back.
When I come to the hospital, I had one leg.
Well, there is a war on, is it possible you miscounted?
Right, you lot. Lots to do. Beat the Germans, save the world.
Don't forget the welfare state!
Setting this to self-destruct, soon as everybody's clear.
History says there was an explosion here.
 Who am I to argue with history?
 Usually, the first in line.
The nanogenes will clean up the mess and switch themselves off, 'cause I just told them to.
Nancy and Jamie will go to Dr Constantine for help, ditto.
All in all, all things considered. Fantastic!
Look at you beaming away like you're Father Christmas.
Who says I'm not? Red bicycle when you were 12.
 What?
 And everybody lives, Rose.
Everybody lives. I need more days like this!
 Doctor.
 Go on, ask me anything. I'm on fire.
What about Jack?
Why did he say goodbye?
Okay, computer, how long can we keep the bomb in stasis?
<i>Stasis decaying at 90% cycle.</i> <i>- Detonation in three minutes.
 Can we jettison it?</i> <i>Any attempt to jettison the device will precipitate detonation.</i> <i>- 100% probability.
 We could stick it in an escape pod?</i> <i>There is no escape pod on board.</i> Okay, see the flaw in that. I'll get in the escape pod.
<i>There is no escape pod on board.</i> <i>- Did you check everywhere?
 Affirmative.</i> <i>- Under the sink?
 Affirmative.</i> Okay.
Out of 100, exactly how dead am I?
<i>Termination of Captain Jack Harkness in under two minutes.</i> <i>100% probability.</i> Lovely. Thanks.
<i>- Good to know the numbers.
 You're welcome.</i> Okay, then!
Think we'd better initiate emergency protocol 417.
<i>Affirmative.</i> A little too much vermouth. See if I come here again.
Funny thing.
Last time I was sentenced to death I ordered four hyper-vodkas for my breakfast.
All a bit of a blur after that.
Woke up in bed with both my executioners.
Lovely couple. They stayed in touch.
Can't say that about most executioners.
Anyway.
Thanks for everything, computer.
It's been great.
Well! Hurry up, then!
Okay, all right and turn.
Okay, try and spin me again. But this time, don't get my arm up my back.
 No extra points for a half-nelson.
 I'm sure I used to know this stuff.
Close the door, will you?
Your ship's about to blow up, there's gonna be a draft.
Welcome to the Tardis.
 Much bigger on the inside.
 You'd better be.
I think what the Doctor is trying to say is, you may cut in.
 Rose! I've just remembered!
 What?
I can dance!
Actually, Doctor, I thought Jack might like this dance.
I'm sure he would, Rose, I'm absolutely certain.
But who with?
 @@@@@@
@@@@@@
There's still no word from inside Downing Street.
Though we are getting even more new arrivals.
We are the Slitheen.
Reduce the Earth to molten slag then sell it.
Leave this planet or I'll stop you.
The world is in your hands.
I've checked the figures. I've checked them again and again.
Always the same result.
The design is not safe. It could result in the death of millions.
I beg of you, stop the project right now before it's too late.
Well, goodness me!
Obviously, Mr Cleaver, you're the expert.
Then, you'll stop it?
It seems I have no choice.
Oh, do excuse me.
 Civic duties leave little time for a sandwich.
 But you promise you'll stop it today?
Well, of course!
Nothing is more important than human life.
What do you take me for? Some sort of maniac?
Why, no.
Am I right in thinking you've shown your results only to me?
 Just to you, no one else.
 Wise move.
I can't tell you, Mrs Blaine, this is such a weight off my mind.
I've barely slept. I couldn't believe my own readings.
The scale of it. Destruction like the British Isles has never seen before.
If I didn't know better, I'd almost think that someone wanted this project to go wrong.
As though they intended this city should be wiped off the map.
Thank goodness we've got you, our esteemed leader.
Who the hell are you?
What do you mean, who the hell am I? Who the hell are you?
Captain Jack Harkness. Whatever you're selling, we're not buying.
Get out of my way!
Don't tell me, this must be Mickey.
Here comes trouble. How you doing, Ricky boy?
 It's Mickey.
 Don't listen to him, he's winding you up.
You look fantastic.
Aw, sweet. Look at these two. How come I never get any of that?
 Buy me a drink first.
 You're such hard work.
But worth it.
Did you manage to find it?
 There you go.
 I can go anywhere now.
I've told you, you don't need a passport.
It's all very well going to Platform One and Justicia and the Glass Pyramid of San Kaloon, but what if we end up in Brazil?
I might need it. You see, I'm prepared for anything.
Sounds like you're staying, then.
So, what are you doing in Cardiff? And who the hell's Jumping Jack Flash?
I don't mind you hanging out with Big Ears up there.
 Oi!
 Look in the mirror.
 But this guy, I don't know, he's kind of...
 Handsome?
More like cheesy.
Early 21 st century slang. Is cheesy good or bad?
 It's bad.
 But bad means good, isn't that right?
You saying I'm not handsome?
We've just stopped off, we need to refuel.
The thing is, Cardiff's got this rift running through the middle of the city.
It's invisible, but it's like an earthquake fault between different dimensions.
The rift was healed back in 1869...
Thanks to a girl named Gwyneth because these creatures called the Gelth were using the rift as a gateway, but she saved the world and closed it.
But closing a rift always leaves a scar and that scar generates energy, harmless to the human race...
But perfect for the Tardis.
Just park here for a couple of days, right on top of the scar and...
Open up the engines, soak up the radiation...
Like filling her up with petrol and off we go.
 Into time.
 And space.
My God, have you seen yourselves? You all think you're so clever, don't you?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
Yeah.
Should take another 24 hours which means we've got time to kill.
That old lady's staring.
Probably wondering what four people can do inside a small wooden box.
What are you captain of? The Innuendo Squad?
Wait, the Tardis, you can't just leave it. Doesn't it get noticed?
Yeah, what's with the police box? Why does it look like that?
 It's a cloaking device.
 It's called a chameleon circuit.
The Tardis is meant to disguise itself wherever it lands.
Like, if this was ancient Rome, it'd be a statue on a plinth or something.
But I landed in the 1960s, it disguised itself as a police box and the circuit got stuck.
So, it copied a real thing? There actually was police boxes?
Yeah, on street corners.
You could phone for help before they had radios and mobiles.
If they arrested somebody, they could shove them inside till help came.
 Like a little prison cell.
 Why don't you just fix the circuit?
 I like it, don't you?
 I love it.
But that's what I meant, there's no police boxes anymore so doesn't it get noticed?
Ricky, let me tell you something about the human race.
You put a mysterious blue box slap-bang in the middle of town, what do they do?
Walk past it. Now, stop your nagging, let's go and explore.
 What's the plan?
 I don't know.
Cardiff, early 21 st century, and the wind's coming from the... east.
Trust me. Safest place in the universe.
This nuclear power station right in the heart of Cardiff city will bring jobs for all.
As you can see, as Lord Mayor, I've had to sanction some radical redevelopments.
No photographs! What did I say?
Take pictures of the project, by all means, but not me, thank you.
So, Cardiff Castle will be demolished, allowing the Blaidd Drwg project to rise up, tall and proud.
A monument to Welsh industry.
And, yes, some of you might shiver.
The words "nuclear power station" and "major population centre" aren't exactly the happiest of bedfellows.
But I give you my personal guarantee that as long as I walk upon this Earth, no harm will come to any of my citizens.
Now, drink up!
A toast, to the future.
To the future.
And believe me...
it will glow.
Mrs Blaine, my name's Cathy Salt. I represent the <i>Cardiff Gazette.</i> I'm sorry, I'm not doing interviews. I can't bear self-publicity.
 But are you aware of the curse?
 Whatever do you mean?
 Cathy, wasn't it?
 Cathy Salt.
That's what some of your engineers are saying, that the Blaidd Drwg project is cursed.
Sounds rather silly to me.
That's what I thought, I was just chasing a bit of local colour.
But the funny thing is, when you start piecing it all together, it does begin to look a bit odd.
 In what way?
 The deaths.
The number of deaths associated with this project.
First of all, there was the entire team of the European Safety Inspectors.
But they were French.
It's not my fault if "Danger Explosives" was only written in Welsh.
And there was that accident with the Cardiff Heritage Committee.
The electrocution of that swimming pool was put down to natural wear and tear.
And then the architect?
It was raining, visibility was low, my car simply couldn't stop.
And then just recently, Mr Cleaver, the government's nuclear adviser.
Slipped on an icy patch.
 He was decapitated.
 It was a very icy patch.
I'm afraid these stories are nothing more than typical small-town thinking.
I really haven't got time. If you'll excuse me.
Except before he died, Mr Cleaver posted some of his findings online.
 Did he now?
 If you know where to look.
 He was concerned about the reactor.
 All that technical stuff.
Specifically, that the design of the suppression pool would cause the hydrogen recombiners to fail, precipitating in the collapse of the containment isolation system and resulting in a meltdown.
 Who's been doing her homework?
 That's my job.
I think... Cathy Salt...
I think you and I should have a word in private.
Oh! My little tummy is complaining.
I think we might have to make a detour to the ladies'.
 I'll wait here.
 Come on. All girls together.
So, you were saying? These outlandish theories of yours.
 Sounds like we got here just in time.
 Continue.
Well, I don't know much about nuclear physics, but from what I could make out, Cleaver was saying that the whole project could go up, worse than Chernobyl.
Is there something wrong with the lights?
They're always on the blink.
I can't tell you how many memos I've sent.
So, Chernobyl?
Apparently, but a thousand times worse.
I mean, it sounds absurd, there must be so many safety regulations.
But Cleaver seemed to be talking about a nuclear holocaust.
He almost made it sound deliberate.
I mean, we're hardly the <i>Sunday Times,</i> we're only the <i>Cardiff Gazette,</i> but we still have a duty to report the facts.
And you're going to print this information?
Are you all right? You sound a bit...
Sore throat.
Just a little tickle.
But tell me, do you intend to make this information public?
I have to.
So be it.
Mind you, my boyfriend thinks I'm mad.
We're getting married next month and he says if I cause a fuss, I could lose my job, just when we need the money.
 Boyfriend?
 Jeffrey.
Civil servant. He's nothing exciting, but he's mine.
 When's the wedding?
 The 19th.
It's really just to stop my mother from nagging, but the baby sort of clinched it, I suppose.
You're with child?
Three months, it's not showing yet.
Wasn't planned, it was an accident. Nice accident, though.
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 How about you?
 No.
 Is there a Mr Blaine?
 Not anymore.
I'm all on my own.
I had quite a sizeable family once upon a time.
Wonderful brothers. Oh, they were bold.
But all of them gone, now.
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm cursed.
No, I don't think so, not really.
You're very kind.
If you don't mind, I might be a while.
You run along. Perhaps we could do this another day.
 Are you all right?
 Fine.
Okay, I tell you what, I'll leave my details with your office.
Thanks for talking.
Thank you.
 I swear!
 You're lying through your teeth!
It turns out the white things are tusks, and I mean, tusks!
And it's woken and it's not happy.
 How could you not know it was there?
 We're standing there, 15 of us, naked.
And I'm like, "No, it's got nothing to do with me." And then it roars, and we're running. My God, we are running.
And Brakovitch falls so I turn to him and I say...
 I knew we should have turned left!
 That's my line!
I don't believe you, I don't believe a word you say, ever. That is so brilliant!
Did you ever get your clothes back?
No, I just picked him up and went right for the ship.
Full throttle, didn't stop till I hit the space lanes. I was shaking!
It was unbelievable! Freaked me out. And by the time I got there, I was 15 light years away and I realised I'm like this...
And I was having such a nice day.
According to Intelligence, the target is the last surviving member of the Slitheen family.
A criminal sect from the planet Raxacoricofallapatorius masquerading as a human being, zipped inside a skin suit.
Okay, plan of attack. We assume a basic 57-56 strategy, covering all available exits on the ground floor.
Doctor, you go face to face, that'll designate Exit 1.
I'll cover Exit 2. Rose, you Exit 3, Mickey Smith, you take Exit 4. Have you got that?
Excuse me, who's in charge?
Sorry, awaiting orders, sir.
Right, here's the plan.
Like he said. Nice plan. Anything else?
 Present arms.
 Ready.
 Ready.
 Ready.
 Speed dial?
 Yeah.
 Ready.
 Check.
See you in hell.
Hello, I've come to see the Lord Mayor.
Have you got an appointment?
No, just an old friend passing by, bit of a surprise.
Can't wait to see her face.
Well, she's just having a cup of tea.
Just go in there and tell her the Doctor would like to see her.
Doctor who?
Just the Doctor. Tell her exactly that, the Doctor.
Hang on a tick.
The Lord Mayor says thank you for popping by.
She'd love to have a chat but she's up to her eyes in paperwork.
Perhaps if you could make an appointment for next week?
She's climbing out of the window, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
 Slitheen heading north.
 On my way.
Over and out.
Oh, my God!
Leave the Mayor alone!
Margaret!
 Who's on Exit 4?
 That was Mickey!
 Here I am.
 Mickey the idiot.
Be fair, she's not exactly gonna outrun us, is she?
She's got a teleport! That's cheating. Now, we're never gonna get her!
The Doctor's very good at teleports.
I could do this all day.
This is persecution. Why can't you leave me alone?
What did I ever do to you?
You tried to kill me and destroy this entire planet.
Apart from that.
So, you're a Slitheen, you're on Earth, you're trapped.
Your family get killed, but you teleport out, just in the nick of time.
You have no means of escape, what do you do?
You build a nuclear power station. But what for?
A philanthropic gesture. I've learnt the error of my ways.
And it just so happens to be right on top of the rift.
 What rift would that be?
 A rift in space and time.
If this power station went into meltdown, the entire planet would go...
This station is designed to explode the minute it reaches capacity.
Didn't anyone notice?
Isn't there someone in London checking this sort of stuff?
We're in Cardiff. London doesn't care.
The South Wales coast could fall into the sea and they wouldn't notice.
Oh! I sound like a Welshman. God help me, I've gone native.
But why would she do that?
A great big explosion, she'd only end up killing herself.
 She's got a name, you know.
 She's not even a she, she's a thing.
Oh, but she's clever.
Fantastic!
Is that a tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator?
Couldn't have put it better myself.
Genius! You didn't build this?
I have my hobbies, a little tinkering.
No, I mean, you really didn't build this. Way beyond you.
 I bet she stole it.
 It fell into my hands.
 Is it a weapon?
 It's transport.
You see, if the reactor blows, the rift opens. Phenomenal cosmic disaster.
But this thing shrouds you in a force-field.
You have this energy bubble... So you're safe.
Then you feed it coordinates, stand on top and ride the concussion all the way out of the solar system.
 It's a surfboard.
 A pan-dimensional surfboard, yeah.
And it would've worked.
I'd have surfed away from this dead-end dump and back to civilisation.
You'd blow up a whole planet just to get a lift?
Like stepping on an ant hill.
How did you think of the name?
What? Blaidd Drwg? It's Welsh.
I know, but how did you think of it?
I chose it at random, that's all, I don't know. Just sounded good.
Does it matter?
Blaidd Drwg.
 What's it mean?
 "Bad Wolf." But I've heard that before. Bad Wolf. I've heard that lots of times.
Everywhere we go, two words, following us.
Bad Wolf.
How can they be following us?
No, just a coincidence.
Like hearing a word on the radio then hearing it all day. Never mind.
Things to do. Margaret, we're gonna take you home.
Hold on, isn't that the easy option? Like letting her go?
I don't believe it, we actually get to go to Rexi...
Wait a minute, Rexicor...
Raxacoricofallapatorius.
 Rexicorico...
 Phalvitorius.
 Raxacoricofallapatorius!
 That's it!
I did it!
They have the death penalty.
The family Slitheen was tried in its absence many years ago and found guilty.
With no chance of appeal.
According to the statutes of government, the moment I return, I'm to be executed.
What do you make of that, Doctor?
Take me home and you take me to my death.
Not my problem.
This ship is impossible!
It's superb!
How do you get the outside around the inside?
Like I'd give you the secret, yeah.
I almost feel better about being defeated.
I never stood a chance.
This is the technology of the gods.
Don't worship me, I'd make a very bad god.
You wouldn't get a day off, for starters.
Jack, how we doing, big fella?
This extrapolator's top of the range. Where did you get it?
I don't know, some airlock sale.
Must've been a great, big heist. It's stacked with power.
 But we can use it for fuel?
 It's not compatible.
But it should knock off about 12 hours.
 We'll be ready to go by morning.
 Then we're stuck here, overnight.
I'm in no hurry.
We've got a prisoner.
The police box is really a police box.
You're not just police, though.
Since you're taking me to my death, that makes you my executioners.
Each and every one of you.
You deserve it.
You're very quick to say so.
And you're very quick to soak your hands in my blood.
Which makes you better than me how, exactly?
Long night ahead.
Let's see who can look me in the eye.
It's freezing out here.
Better than in there.
She does deserve it, she's a Slitheen, I don't care.
It's just weird in that box.
I didn't really need my passport.
I've been thinking, you know, we could go have a drink.
Have a pizza or something, just you and me.
That'd be nice.
And, I mean, if the Tardis can't leave until morning...
We could go to a hotel. Spend the night.
I mean, if you want to. I've got some money.
Okay, yeah.
 Is that all right?
 Yeah.
Cool, there's a couple of bars round here, we should give them a go.
Do you have to go and tell him?
It's none of his business.
So, what's on?
Nothing, just...
I gather it's not always like this.
Having to wait.
I bet you're always the first to leave, Doctor.
Never mind the consequences, off you go.
You butchered my family and then ran for the stars, am I right?
But not this time.
At last, you have consequences.
 How does it feel?
 I didn't butcher them.
Don't answer back, that's what she wants.
I didn't. What about you?
You had an emergency teleport, you didn't zap them to safety, did you?
It only carries one.
I had to fly without coordinates.
I ended up in a skip on the Isle of Dogs.
 It wasn't funny.
 Sorry.
It is a bit funny.
Do I get a last request?
Depends what it is.
I grew quite fond of my little human life.
All those rituals.
The brushing of the teeth and the complicated way they cook things.
There's a little restaurant, just round the Bay.
It became quite a favourite of mine.
 Is that what you want? A last meal?
 Don't I have rights?
Like she's not gonna try to escape.
Except I can never escape the Doctor so where's the danger?
I wonder if you could do it.
To sit with a creature you're about to kill and take supper.
 How strong is your stomach?
 Strong enough.
I wonder.
I've seen you fight your enemies.
Now dine with them.
 You won't change my mind.
 Prove it.
There are people out there.
If you slip away just for one second, they'll be in danger.
Except, I've got these.
You both wear one.
If she moves more than ten feet away...
She gets zapped by 10,000 volts.
Margaret, would you like to come out to dinner? My treat.
Dinner in bondage.
Works for me.
Here we are, out on a date, and you haven't even asked my proper name.
It's not a date.
 What's your name?
 Blon.
I'm Blon Fel Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen That's what it'll say on my death certificate.
 Nice to meet you, Blon.
 I'm sure.
Look, that's where I was living as Margaret.
Nice little flat, over there on the top.
Next to the one with the light on.
Two bedrooms, bayside view. I was rather content.
Don't suppose I'll see it again.
Suppose not.
 Thank you.
 Pleasure.
Tell me, then, Doctor, what do you know of our species?
Only what I've seen.
Did you know, for example, in extreme cases, when her life is in danger, a female Raxacoricofallapatorius can manufacture a poison dart within her own finger.
Yes, I did.
Just checking.
And one more thing.
Between you and me...
As a final resort, the excess poison can be exhaled through the lungs.
That's better. Now then, what do you think?
Steak looks nice.
Steak and chips!
The Doctor took me to this planet a while back.
It was much colder than this.
They called it Woman Wept.
The planet was actually called Woman Wept because if you looked at it, right, from above, it was like this huge continent, like, all curved round.
It sort of looked like a woman, you know, lamenting.
Oh, my God, and we went to this beach, right.
No people, no buildings, just this beach, like, 1,000 miles across.
And something happened, something to do with the sun, I don't know, but the sea had just frozen.
In a split second.
In the middle of a storm, right, waves and foam, just frozen, all the way out to the horizon.
Midnight, right, we walk underneath these waves, 100 feet tall and made of ice.
I'm going out with Trisha Delaney.
Oh, right.
That's nice.
 Trisha from the shop?
 Yeah, Rob Delaney's sister.
Well, she's nice.
 She's a bit big.
 She lost weight.
You've been away.
Well, good for you. She's nice.
 So, tell us more about this planet, then.
 That was it, really.
Public execution is a slow death.
They prepare a thin acetic acid, lower me into the cauldron...
and boil me.
The acidity is perfectly gauged to strip away the skin.
Internal organs fall out into the liquid and I become soup.
And still alive.
Still screaming.
 I don't make the law.
 But you deliver it.
Will you stay to watch?
What else can I do?
The Slitheen family's huge.
There's a lot more of us, all scattered off-world. Take me to them.
Take me somewhere safe.
 But then you'll just start again.
 I promise I won't.
You've been in that skin suit too long.
You've forgotten. There used to be a real Margaret Blaine.
You killed her and stripped her and used the skin.
You're pleading for mercy out of a dead woman's lips.
Perhaps I have got used to it.
A human life, an ordinary life.
That's all I'm asking.
Give me a chance, Doctor.
 I can change.
 I don't believe you.
 So, what do you want to do now?
 Don't mind.
We could ask about hotels.
What would Trisha Delaney say?
I suppose.
There's a bar down there with a Spanish name...
You don't even like Trisha Delaney!
Is that right? What the hell do you know?
I know you and I know her and I know that's never gonna happen.
 So, who do you think you're kidding?
 At least I know where she is!
There we are, then.
It's got nothing to do with Trisha. This is all about me, isn't it?
You left me!
We were nice, we were happy.
And then what? You give me a kiss and run off with him and you make me feel like nothing, Rose. I was nothing!
I can't even go out with a stupid girl from a shop because you pick up the phone and I comes running.
I mean, is that what I am, Rose, standby?
Am I just supposed to sit here for the rest of my life waiting for you?
 Because I will.
 I'm sorry.
I promise you I've changed since we last met, Doctor.
There was this girl, just today.
Young thing.
And something of a danger. She was getting too close.
I felt the blood lust rising, just as the family taught me.
I was going to kill her without a thought.
And then...
I stopped.
She's alive somewhere, right now.
She's walking round this city because I can change.
I did change.
 I know I can't prove it.
 I believe you.
Then you know I'm capable of better.
It doesn't mean anything.
I spared her life.
You let one of them go. But that's nothing new.
Every now and then a little victim's spared.
Because she smiled. Because he's got freckles.
Because they begged.
And that's how you live with yourself.
That's how you slaughter millions.
Because once in a while, on a whim, if the wind's in the right direction...
you happen to be kind.
Only a killer would know that.
Is that right?
From what I've seen, your funny little happy-go-lucky life leaves devastation in its wake.
Always moving on because you dare not go back.
Playing with so many people's lives, you might as well be a god.
And you're right, Doctor.
You're absolutely right.
Sometimes, you let one go.
Let me go.
I'm not asking you to leave him because I know that's not fair.
But I just need something, yeah, some sort of promise that when you do come back, you're coming back for me.
 Is that thunder?
 Does it matter?
That's not thunder.
In the family Slitheen, we had no choice.
I was made to carry out my first kill at 13.
If I'd refused, my father would have fed me to the Venom Grubs.
If I'm a killer, it's because I was born to kill. It's all I know.
Doctor, are you even listening to me?
 Can you hear that?
 I'm begging for my life.
No, listen, shush.
Go on, then, run.
It's him again, isn't it? It's the Doctor. It's always the Doctor.
It's always gonna be the Doctor. It's never me!
The handcuffs!
 Don't think you're running away.
 I'm sticking with you.
Some date this turned out to be!
It's the rift. The rift's opening.
 What the hell are you doing?
 It just went crazy!
It's the rift. Time and space are ripping apart.
The whole city's going to disappear.
It's the extrapolator.
I've disconnected it, but it's still feeding off the engine.
It's using the Tardis, I can't stop it.
Never mind Cardiff, it's gonna rip open the planet!
What is it? What's happening?
Just little me.
One wrong move and she snaps like a promise.
I might have known.
I've had you bleating all night, poor baby.
Now, shut it.
You, fly boy.
Put the extrapolator at my feet.
Thank you.
Just as I planned.
I thought you needed to blow up the nuclear power station.
Failing that, if I were to be arrested, then anyone capable of tracking me down would have considerable technology of their own.
Therefore, they would be captivated by the extrapolator.
Especially a magpie-mind like yours, Doctor.
So, the extrapolator was programmed to go to Plan B.
To lock on to the nearest alien power source and open the rift.
And what a power source it found.
I'm back on schedule.
Thanks to you.
The rift's gonna convulse, you'll destroy the whole planet.
And you with it.
While I ride this board over the crest of the inferno, all the way to freedom.
Stand back, boys.
Surf's up.
Of course, opening the rift means you'll pull this ship apart.
So sue me.
It's not just any old power source.
It's the Tardis, my Tardis.
The best ship in the universe.
It'll make wonderful scrap.
 What's that light?
 The heart of the Tardis.
This ship's alive.
You've opened its soul.
It's... so bright.
Look at it, Margaret.
Beautiful.
Look inside, Blon Fel Fotch.
Look at the light.
Thank you.
Don't look, stay there, close your eyes!
Now, Jack, come on, shut it all down. Shut down.
Rose, that panel over there, turn all switches to the right.
Nicely done. Thank you, all.
What happened to Margaret?
 Must've got burned up.
 Carried out her own death sentence.
No, I don't think she's dead.
Then where'd she go?
She looked into the heart of the Tardis. Even I don't know how strong that is.
And the ship's telepathic, like I told you, Rose.
Gets inside your head, translates alien languages.
Maybe the raw energy can translate all sorts of thoughts.
 Here she is.
 She's an egg?
 Regressed to her childhood.
 She's an egg?
She can start again. Live her life from scratch.
If we take her home, give her to a different family, tell them to bring her up properly, she might be all right.
 Or she might be worse.
 That's her choice.
 She's an egg.
 She's an egg.
Oh, my God, Mickey.
We're all powered up, we can leave. Opening the rift filled us up with energy.
 We can go. If that's all right.
 Yeah, fine.
 How's Mickey?
 He's okay. He's gone.
Do you want to go and find him? We'll wait.
No need. He deserves better.
Off we go, then. Always moving on.
Next stop, Raxacoricofallapatorius.
Now, you don't often get to say that.
We'll stop by and pop her in the hatchery.
Margaret the Slitheen can live her life again. A second chance.
That'd be nice.

<i>The Fourth Great</i> <i>and Bountiful Human Emplre.</i> Every single fact in the Empire beams out of this place.
Now, that's what I call power.
Six hundred channels, all coming out of Satellite Five, broadcasting everywhere.
This technology's wrong.
 Trouble?
 Oh, yeah.
This is not the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire.
It's a place where humans are allowed to live by kind permission of my client.
Who controls Satellite Five?
The Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.
You mean that thing's in charge of Satellite Five?
Once you go to Floor 500, you never come back.
You'll have to stay and explain it, no one's going to believe me.
They might start believing a lot of things now.
The human race should accelerate, all back to normal.
What's happening?
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it! Why did they put you in there?
They never said you were coming.
What happened? I was...
Careful now. Ooh, mind yourself.
That's the transmat, it scrambles your head.
I was sick for days. All right?
So, what's your name, then, sweetheart?
The Doctor, I think. I was... I don't know. What happened?
You got chosen.
Chosen for what?
You're a housemate! You're in the house. Isn't that brilliant?
That's not fair, we've got eviction in five minutes!
I've been here for all nine weeks, I've followed the rules, I haven't had a single warning, then he comes swanning in.
If they keep changing the rules, I'm gonna protest, I am. You watch me.
I'm gonna paint the walls.
<i>Would the Doctor</i> <i>please come to the Diary Room?</i> <i>You are live on Channel 44,000.</i> <i>Please do not swear.</i> You have got to be kidding.
What happened?
It's all right, it's the transmat. It does your head in.
You get a bit of amnesia. What's your name?
Rose. But where's the Doctor?
Just remember, do what the android says. Don't provoke it.
The android's word is law.
What do you mean, android? Like a robot?
Positions, everyone. Thank you!
Come on, hurry up.
Steady.
I was travelling... with the Doctor and a man called Captain Jack.
The Doctor wouldn't just leave me...
That's enough chat. Positions, final call. Good luck.
But I'm not supposed to be here.
It says Rose on the podium. Come on.
Hold on, I must be going mad.
It can't be. This looks like...
Android activated!
Oh, my God, the android.
The Anne... droid.
<i>Welcome to The Weakest Llnk.</i> <i>- Here we go agaln.</i>  <i>- We've got our work cut out for us.</i> <i>I don't know, he's sort of</i> <i>handsome. Has a good lantern jaw.</i> <i>Lantern jaws are so last year.</i> Sorry, but, nice to meet you, ladies, but where exactly am I?
<i>We're giving you a brand-new Image.</i> Hold on, I was with the Doctor.
Why, is there something wrong with what I'm wearing?
<i>It's all very 20th century.</i> <i>Where did you get that denim?</i> A little place in Cardiff. It was called The Top Shop.
<i>Design classic</i> <i>But we're going to have to find you</i> <i>some new colours,</i> <i>maybe get rid of that "Oklahoma farm boy"</i> <i>thing you've got going on.</i> <i>Just stand still</i> <i>and let the defabricator work its maglc.</i> What's the defabricator?
Okay. Defabricator. Does exactly what it says on the tin.
Am I naked in front of millions of viewers?
<i>Absolutely!</i> Ladies... your viewing figures just went up.
Can't open it.
It's got a deadlock seal. Ever since Big Brother 504 when they all walked out, you must remember that?
What about this?
That's Exoglass. You need a nuclear bomb to get through.
Don't tempt me.
I know you're not supposed to talk about the outside world, but you must've been watching. Do people like me?
Lynda, Lynda with a "Y" not Linda with an "l".
She got forcibly evicted 'cause she damaged a camera. Am I popular?
 I don't remember.
 Does that mean I'm nothing?
Some people get this far 'cause they're insignificant. Doesn't anybody notice me?
No, you're... nice, you're sweet. Everybody thinks you're sweet.
Oh? Is that right? Is that what I am? No one's ever told me that before.
Am I sweet? Really?
Yeah. Dead sweet.
Thank you.
It's a wall. Isn't there supposed to be a garden out there?
Don't be daft, no one's got a garden anymore.
Who's got a garden? Don't tell me you've got a garden!
No, I've just got the Tardis.
I remember.
That's the amnesia! So, what happened? Where did they get you?
We'd just left Raxacoricofallapatorius.
Then we went to Kyoto. That's right, Japan, in 1336 and we only just escaped.
<i>We were together,</i> <i>we were laughing and then...</i> <i>there was this light,</i> <i>this white light coming through the walls</i> <i>and then...</i> I woke up here.
Yeah, that's the transmat beam. That's how they pick the housemates.
Oh, Lynda with a "Y". Sweet, little Lynda.
It's worse than that.
I'm not just some passing traveller.
No stupid little transmat gets inside my ship.
That beam was 15 million times more powerful.
Which means... this isn't just a game.
There's something else going on.
Well, here's the latest update from the Big Brother house.
I'm getting out. I'm gonna find my friends.
And then I'm gonna find you.
 Need a word.
 Hold on, let me finish this.
19, 18...
17, 16, 15...
Thank you, people, transmitting in...
12, 11, 10...
I need to find the Doctor...
Just shut up and play the game.
All right, then. What the hell, I'm gonna play to win.
... and cue!
<i>Let's play The Weakest Link. Start the clock.</i> <i>Agorax, the name of which BASIC foodstuff</i> <i>Is an anagram of the word "beard"?</i>  Bread. <i>- Correct.</i> <i>Fitch, In the Pan Traffic Calendar,</i> <i>which month comes after Hoob?</i>  Is it Clavadoe? <i>- No, Pandoff.</i> <i>Rose, in maths, what is 258 minus 158?</i>  100! <i>- Correct.</i> <i>- Rodrlck.</i>  Bank.
<i>Which letter of the alphabet</i> <i>appears in the word dangle</i> <i>but not in the word gland?</i>  E. <i>- Correct.</i> <i>Colleen, in social security,</i> <i>what D is the name of the payment</i> <i>given to Martian Drones?</i>  Default. <i>- Correct.</i> <i>Broff, the Great Cobalt Pyramid</i> <i>is built on the remains</i> <i>of which famous Old Earth Institute?</i>  Touchdown. <i>- No, Torchwood.</i> <i>Agorax, in language, all five examples</i> <i>of which type of letter</i> <i>appear in the word facetious?</i>  Vowels. <i>- Correct.</i> <i>Fitch, in biology,</i> <i>which blood cells contain iron, red or white?</i>  White. <i>- No, red.</i> <i>Rose, in the holovid series, Jupiter Rising,</i> <i>the Grexnlk is married to whom?</i> <i>How should I know?</i> Why is she laughing?
Oh, my God, I think she knows.
And I've got a housemate who appeared out of nowhere. I told you.
It's like the game's running itself.
<i>It's the Buccaneer look.</i> <i>Little dash of pirate and just a tweak of</i> <i>President Schwarzenegger.</i> Not sure about the vest. What about a little bit of colour to lift it?
<i>Absolutely not, never wear black with colour.</i> <i>It makes the colour look cheap</i> <i>and the black look borlng.</i> <i>Now, let's talk jackets.</i>  I kind of like the first one. <i>- No, that's a bit too much Hell's Angel.</i> <i>I think I like the shorter one. Look!</i> <i>Waist-length, nice and slimming,</i> <i>shows off the bum.</i> Works for me.
<i>Once we've got an outfit,</i> <i>we can look at the face.</i> <i>Ever thought about cosmetic surgery?</i> I've considered it, yeah. A little lift around the eyes, tighten up the jaw line, what do you think?
<i>Let's have a bit more ambltlon.</i> <i>Let's do something cutting edge.</i> <i>So, Rose, what do you actually do?</i> I just travel about a bit. Bit of a tourist, I suppose.
<i>Another way of saying unemployed?</i>  No! <i>- Have you got a job?</i> Well, not really, no...
<i>Then you are unemployed.</i> <i>Yet you've still got enough money</i> <i>to buy peroxide. Why Fitch?</i> Er... I think she got a few of the questions wrong, that's all.
<i>And you'd know all about that.</i> Well, yeah, but I can't vote for myself, so it had to be Fitch.
Sorry, that's the game, that's how it works. I had to vote for someone.
Let me try again. It was the lights and everything, I couldn't think...
<i>In fact, with three answers wrong,</i> <i>Broff was the Weakest Link in that round.</i> <i>But it's votes that count</i> I'm sorry, please. Oh, God, help me.
<i>Fitch, you are the Weakest Link. Goodbye.</i> And we've gone to the adverts. Back in three minutes.
What's that? What just happened?
She was the Weakest Link, she gets disintegrated.
Blasted into atoms.
But I voted for her.
Oh, my God, this is sick.
All of you, you're just sick. I'm not playing...
I'm not playing! I can't do it.
Please, somebody let me out of here.
<i>You are the Weakest Llnk.</i> <i>Goodbye.</i> Don't try to escape.
It's play or die.
Doctor, they said all housemates must gather on the sofa, you've got to.
I'm busy getting out, thanks.
But if you don't obey, then all the housemates get punished.
Well, maybe I'll be voted out, then.
How stupid are you? You've only just joined, you're not eligible.
And don't try anything clever or we all get it in the neck.
<i>Big Brother house, this is Davinadroid.</i> <i>Crosbie, Lynda and Strood,</i> <i>you have all been nominated for evlctlon.</i> <i>And the eighth person to be evicted</i> <i>from the Big Brother house is...</i> <i>- Crosbie!</i>  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It should've been me, that's not fair, Crosbie.
<i>Crosbie, you have 10 seconds</i> <i>to make your farewells</i> <i>and then we're going to get you!</i> I won't forget you.
 I'm sorry I stole your soap.
 I don't mind, honestly.
And thanks for the food, you're a smashing cook. Bless you.
<i>Crosbie, please leave the Big Brother house.</i> Bye, then. Bye, Lynda.
Bye.
I don't believe it. Crosbie.
It's only a game show. She'll make a fortune on the outside.
Sell her story, release a record, fitness video, all of that. She'll be laughing.
 What do you mean, on the outside?
 Here we go.
What are they waiting for? Why don't they just let her go?
Stop it, it's not funny.
<i>Eviction in 5, 4...</i> <i>3, 2, 1.</i> What was that?
Disintegrator beam.
She's been evicted.
From life.
No one programmed the transmat, no one selected new contestants.
It is exactly like those stories.
Don't start that again. I think you need to take a session off.
I would, if you'd take it with me.
And don't start that again either.
But the rumours go back decades. Saying that something's been hidden up here.
Underneath the transmissions.
But the Controller would know. She watches everything.
Maybe she just can't see it. You've got to allow for human error.
Well, that's your problem, then.
I don't think she's been human for years.
18, 19, 20.
Transmit.
Are you insane? You just step right into the disintegrator?
Is it that important getting your face on the telly? Is it worth dying for?
 You're talking like we've got a choice!
 I thought you had to apply.
Don't be so stupid. That's how they played it centuries back.
You get chosen whether you like it or not.
Everyone on Earth is a potential contestant, the transmat beam picks you out at random.
And it's nonstop. There are 60 Big Brother houses all running at once.
 How many? 60?
 They've had to cut back, it's not what it was.
It's a charnel house. What about the winners? What do they get?
 They get to live.
 Is that it?
Well, isn't that enough?
Rose is out there. She got caught in the transmat, she's a contestant.
Time I got out.
That other contestant, Linda with an "l", she was forcibly evicted for what?
 Damage to property.
 What, like this?
No, I'm just not getting this.
It's just too safe. Too decent. And you'd never keep it clean.
<i>Stage two ready and waltlng.</i> Bring it on, girls.
<i>And now it's time for the face-off!</i> What does that mean? Do I get to compete with someone else?
<i>No, like I said, face... off.</i> <i>I think you'd look good with a dog's head!</i> <i>Or maybe no head at all,</i> <i>that would be so outrageous.</i> <i>And we could stitch your legs</i> <i>to the middle of your chest.</i> <i>Nothing is too extreme. It's to die for.</i> Hold on, ladies, I don't want to have to shoot either one of you.
<i>- But you're unarmed.</i> <i>- You're naked!</i> <i>- But that's a Compact Laser Deluxe.</i> <i>- Where were you hiding that?</i> You really don't want to know.
<i>Give me that accessory!</i> <i>You are the Weakest Link. Goodbye.</i> Going to the break, two minutes on the clock.
Just a reminder, we've got solar flare activity coming up in 10.
Thanks, everyone.
Colleen was clever, she banked all our money, why'd you vote for her?
'Cause I want to keep you in. You're stupid.
You don't even know the Princess Vossaheen's surname.
When it comes to the final, I want to be up against you.
So that you get disintegrated and I get a stackload of credits.
 Courtesy of the Bad Wolf Corporation.
 What do you mean? Who's Bad Wolf?
They're in charge, they run the Game Station.
Why are they called Bad Wolf?
I don't know, it's just a name. It's like an Old Earth nursery rhyme sort of thing.
What does it matter?
I keep hearing those words everywhere we go. Bad Wolf.
The things you see...
the darkness.
The big, bad wolf.
<i>Attention all personnel,</i> <i>Bad Wolf 1 descending.</i> "Blaidd Drwg."  What's it mean?
 Bad Wolf.
Different times, different places. Like it's written all over the universe.
What are you going on about?
If the Bad Wolf is in charge of the quiz then maybe I'm not here by mistake.
Someone's been planning this.
<i>The Doctor, you've broken the house rules.</i> <i>Big Brother has no choice but to evict you.</i> <i>You have 10 seconds to make your farewells</i> <i>and then we're gonna get you!</i> That's more like it! Come on, then, open up!
You're mad, it's like you want to die.
I reckon he's a plant, he was only brought in to stir things up.
<i>The Doctor,</i> <i>please leave the Big Brother house.</i> <i>Come on, then, disintegrate me!</i> <i>Come on, what are you waiting for?</i> He is, he's mad. He's bonkers!
I told you to keep an eye on him, not kill him.
He damaged the property, it's an automatic process.
<i>Eviction in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i> <i>Ha-ha! I knew it! You see,</i> <i>someone brought me into this game.</i> <i>If they wanted me dead,</i> <i>they could've transmatted me into a volcano.</i>  What did you do?
 Nothing.
It's like some sort of override.
<i>... maybe the security isn't as tight this end.</i> <i>You following this? I'm getting out!</i>  Come with me.
 We're not allowed.
Stay in there, you got a 50-50 chance of disintegration.
Stay with me, I promise I'll get you out alive. Come on!
No, I can't.
Lynda, you're sweet. From what I've seen of your world, do you think anybody votes for sweet?
Hold on. I've been here before.
This is Satellite Five.
No guards, makes a change.
You'd think a big business like Satellite Five would be armed to the teeth.
No one's called it Satellite Five in ages.
It's the Game Station now. Hasn't been Satellite Five in about 100 years.
100 years exactly. It's the year 200100.
I was here before, Floor 139.
The Satellite was broadcasting news channels back then.
Had a bit of trouble upstairs. Nothing too serious.
Easy, gave them a hand, home in time for tea.
Hundred years ago? What? You were here 100 years ago?
Yes.
Well, you're looking good on it.
I moisturise.
Funny sorts of readings. All kinds of energy. Place is humming.
It's weird, this goes way beyond normal transmissions.
What would they need all that power for?
I don't know. I think we're the first ever contestants to get outside.
I had two friends with me, they must have got caught in the transmat. Where would they be?
I don't know, they could have been allocated anywhere.
There's 100 different games.
Like what?
There's 10 floors of Big Brother, there's a different house behind each of these doors, and then beyond that there's all sorts of shows.
It's nonstop. There's Call My Bluff, with real guns.
Countdown, where you got 30 seconds to stop the bomb going off.
Ground Force, which is a nasty one. You get turned into compost.
Wipeout, speaks for itself.
Oh, and Stars In Their Eyes, literally, stars in their eyes.
If you don't sing, you get blinded.
And you watch this stuff?
Everyone does. How come you don't?
Never paid for my licence.
Oh, my God, you get executed for that.
Let them try.
You keep saying things that don't make sense.
Who are you, though, Doctor, really?
It doesn't matter.
Well, it does to me. I've just put my life in your hands.
I'm just a traveller wandering past. Believe it or not, all I'm after is a quiet life.
So, if we get out of here, what are you going to do? Just wander off again?
As fast as I can.
'Cause, erm... I could come with you.
 Maybe you could.
 I wouldn't get in the way.
I wouldn't mind if you did. Not a bad idea, Lynda with a "Y".
But first of all, we've got to concentrate on the getting out.
To do that, you've got to know your enemy. Who's controlling it?
Who's in charge of the Satellite now?
Hold on.
Your lords and masters.
Okay, you win, the Controller's got to handle this.
Archive makes a record of all transmat activities.
Find out how he got on board.
Archive 6.
Controller, we have a problem.
Continue working.
We have a security problem.
Continue working.
I'm sorry, but I can't. We have contestants outside of the games.
But the alarms haven't gone off.
No security, the games continue.
But we can't just let them wander.
They are no one.
They are no one.
I'm sorry, I was just...
Archive 6 is out of bounds.
I need to check the transmat log.
Archive 6 is out of bounds. No one may enter Archive 6. Return to work.
Return to work.
Inform all staff, solar flares in Delta.7.
Compatible systems, just align the wave signature.
Attaboy!
Got myself a gun. Well, ladies, the pleasure was all mine, which is the only thing that matters in the end.
Two hearts, that's him. Which floor?
Blimey! I've never seen it for real before, not from orbit.
Planet Earth!
What's happened to it?
It's always been like that, ever since I was born. See that there?
That's the Great Atlantic Smog Storm, it's been going 20 years.
We get newsflashes telling us when it's safe to breathe outside.
So the population just sits there? Half the world's too fat and half the world's too thin and you lot just watch telly?
10,000 channels. All beaming down from here.
The human race. Brainless sheep, being fed on a diet of...
Have they still got that programme where three people have to live with a bear?
Bear With Me! I love that!
The celebrity edition where the bear got in the bath.
But it's all gone wrong. I mean, history's gone wrong. Again!
This should be the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire.
I don't understand. Last time I was here I put it right.
No, but that's when it first went wrong. 100 years ago.
Like you said, all the news channels, they just shut down overnight.
But that was me. I did that.
There was nothing left in their place. No information.
The whole planet just froze. The government, the economy, they collapsed.
That was the start of it. 100 years of hell.
Oh, my...
I made this world.
<i>That leaves Rose and Rodrlck.</i> <i>You're going head-to-head.</i> <i>Let's play The Weakest Link!</i> Right, that's the end of tactical voting. You're on your own now.
<i>- Hey, handsome, good to see you.</i>  <i>- Any sign of Rose?</i> Can't you track her down?
She must still be inside the games. All the rooms are shielded.
If I can just get inside this computer. She's got to be here somewhere.
You'd better hurry up, these games don't have a happy ending.
You think I don't know that?
There you go, patch that in. It's programmed to find her.
 Thanks.
 Hey, there.
 Hello.
 Captain Jack Harkness.
 Lynda Moss.
 Nice to meet you, Lynda Moss.
 Do you mind flirting outside?
 I was just saying hello.
For you, that's flirting.
 I'm not complaining.
 Muchas gracias.
It's not compatible. This stupid system doesn't make sense.
This place should be a basic broadcaster. But the systems are twice as complicated.
It's more than just television. This station's transmitting something else.
 Like what?
 I don't know.
This whole Bad Wolf thing's tied up with me.
Someone's manipulated my entire life.
It's some sort of trap and Rose is stuck inside it.
<i>Rose, in geography,</i> <i>the Grand Central Ravine</i> <i>is named after which ancient British city?</i> Is it York?
<i>No, the correct answer is Sheffleld.</i> Found her. Floor 407.
Oh, my God, she's with the Anne Droid! You've got to get her out of there!
<i>Rodrick, in literature,</i> <i>the author of Lucky was Jackie who?</i> Stewart.
<i>No, the correct answer is Collins.</i> <i>Rose, the oldest inhabitant</i> <i>of the Isop Galaxy is the Face of what?</i> Boe! The Face of Boe!
<i>That is the correct answer.</i> Come on.
<i>Rodrick, in history who was</i> <i>the President of the Red Velvets?</i> Hoshbin Frane.
<i>That is the correct answer.</i> <i>Rose, in food, the dish Gaffabeque</i> <i>originated on which planet?</i> Erm... is it...
 Mars? <i>- No, the correct answer is Lucifer.</i> <i>Rodrick, which measurement of length</i> <i>is said to have been defined</i> <i>by the Emperor Jate as the distance</i> <i>from his nose to his fingertip?</i> Would that be a goffle?
<i>No, the correct answer is a paab.</i> <i>Rose, in fashion,</i> <i>Stella Pok Baint is famous for what?</i> Shoes.
<i>No, the correct answer is hats.</i> Game Room 6, which one is it?
Over here!
San... Hazeldine?
<i>No, the correct answer is San Chen.</i>  Stand back, let me blast it open.
 You can't, it's a vital combination.
<i>Rose, in history, which Icelandic city</i> <i>hosted Murder Spree 20?</i> Reykjavik?
<i>No, the correct answer is Pola Ventura.</i> Oh, my God! I've done it! You've lost!
Come on, come on!
<i>- Rodrick, you are the Strongest Llnk.</i>  I'm not meant to be here.
<i>You will be transported home</i> <i>with 1,600 credlts.</i> I need to find the Doctor!
 He wouldn't just leave me!
 Thank you so much.
This game is illegal, I'm telling you to stop!
Rose! Stop this game. I order you to stop this game!
<i>- You are the Weakest Link.</i>  Look out for the Anne Droid, it's armed!
Back off!
I need security and I need it here right now!
 It's this lot.
 Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!
Sir, put down the gun or I'll have to shoot.
You killed her!
Your stupid freaking game show killed her!
Sir, I'm arresting you under Private Legislation 16 of the Game Station...
Can you tell us the purpose of this device, sir?
Can you tell us how you got on board?
Just leave him alone.
I'm asking him.
Sir? Can you tell us who you are?
You will be taken from this place to the Lunar Penal Colony, there to be held without trial. You may not appeal against this sentence.
Is that understood?
Let's do it.
Oh, my God, now we're in trouble.

Clear the floor! He's on his way up here. With a gun!
This is an emergency, you've got to close down the lift.
All staff are reminded that solar flares...
Never mind the solar flares, he's gonna kill you!
Okay, move away from the desk. Nobody try anything clever.
Everybody clear, stand to the side and stay there.
Who's in charge of this place?
 This Satellite is more than a Game Station. ...79, 80...
 Who killed Rose Tyler? I want an answer.
 All staff are reminded that...
She can't reply. Don't shoot!
Don't be so thick, like I was ever gonna shoot.
Captain, we've got more guards on the way up.
 Secure the exits.
 Yes, sir!
You! What were you saying?
 But I've got your gun.
 Okay, so shoot me. Why can't she answer?
She's... Can I put this down?
 If you want, just hurry up.
 Thanks.
Sorry. The Controller is linked into the transmissions.
The entire output goes through her brain.
You're not a member of staff so she doesn't recognise your existence.
 What's her name?
 I don't know.
She was installed when she was five. It's the only life she's ever known.
Doors sealed. We should be safe for about 10 minutes.
Keep an eye on them.
What you were saying about the Game Station, I think you're right. I've kept a log.
Unauthorised transmats, encrypted signals, it's been going on for years.
Show me.
You're not allowed in there. Archive 6 is out of bounds.
Do I look like an out of bounds sort of guy?
What the hell?
Solar flare activity in Delta.015.
If you're not holding us hostage then let us out. The staff are terrified.
That's the same staff who execute hundreds of contestants every day?
We're just doing our jobs.
And with that sentence you just lost the right to even talk to me, now back off!
That's just the solar flares. They interfere with the broadcast signal so this place automatically powers down.
Planet Earth gets a few repeats. It's all quite normal.
Doctor...
 Doctor?
 Whatever it is, you can wait.
I think she wants you.
Doctor. Doctor. Where's the Doctor?
I'm here.
Can't see. Blind, so blind.
All my life blind, all I can see is numbers. But I saw you.
 What do you want?
 Solar flares hiding me, they can't hear me.
My Masters listen but they can't hear me now.
The sun is so bright.
Who are your masters?
They wired my head, the name's forbidden. They control my thoughts.
My Masters, I had to be careful.
They monitor transmission but they don't watch the programmes.
I could hide you in the games. I knew that you'd find me.
My friend died inside your games.
 Doesn't matter.
 Don't dare tell me that!
They've been hiding. My Masters, hiding in the dark space.
Watching and shaping the Earth, so many years.
Always been there, guiding humanity. Hundreds and hundreds of years.
Who are they?
They wait and plan and grow in numbers, they're strong now.
 So strong, my Masters...
 Who are they?
But speak of you, my Masters, they fear the Doctor...
Tell me, who are they?
When's the next solar flare?
 Two years' time.
 Fat lot of good that is!
 Found the Tardis.
 We're not leaving now.
No, but the Tardis worked it out. You'll wanna watch this.
Lynda, could you stand over there for me, please?
I just want to go home.
It'll only take a second. Could you stand in that spot? Quick as you can.
Everybody watching? Okay, 3, 2, 1.
 But you killed her.
 Oh? Do you think?
What the hell was that?
It's a transmat beam. Not a disintegrator.
A secondary transmat system. People don't get killed in the games.
They get transported across space. Doctor, Rose is still alive!
No. It can't be...
You're dead. I saw you die!
 She's out there somewhere.
 Doctor! Coordinates 5.6.1.
Don't! The solar flare's gone, they'll hear you!
...434. No, my Masters, no, I defy you!
Sigma 77...
They took her.
My Masters.
You can kill me. For I have brought your destruction.
Use that, it might contain the final numbers.
I kept a log of all the unscheduled transmissions.
Nice, thanks. Captain Jack Harkness, by the way.
 I'm Davitch Pavale.
 Nice to meet you, Davitch Pavale.
There's a time and a place.
Are you saying this whole setup's been a disguise all along?
Going way back. Installing the Jagrafess 100 years ago.
Someone's been playing a long game.
Controlling the human race from behind the scenes for generations.
Click on this.
The transmat delivers to that point, right on the edge of the solar system.
There's nothing there.
It looks like nothing because that's what this Satellite does!
Underneath the transmission, there's another signal.
 Doing what?
 Hiding whatever's out there.
Hiding it from sonar, radar, scanners.
There's something sitting right on top of planet Earth but it's completely invisible.
If I cancel the signal...
That's impossible. I know those ships.
They were destroyed.
Obviously they survived.
Who did? Who are they?
200 ships. More than 2,000 on board each one.
That's just about half a million of them.
Half a million what?
Daleks.
<i>Alert. Alert. We are detected!</i> <i>It is the Doctor! He has located us.</i> <i>Open communications channel.</i> <i>The female will stand. Stand!</i> <i>I will talk to the Doctor.</i> Oh, will you? That's nice. Hello.
<i>The Dalek Stratagem nears completlon.</i> <i>The Fleet is almost ready.</i> <i>You will not intervene.</i> Oh, really? Why's that, then?
<i>We have your assoclate.</i> <i>You will obey or she will be extermlnated.</i> No.
<i>Explain yourself.</i> I said, no.
<i>What is the meaning of this negative?</i> It means no.
<i>But she will be destroyed</i> No, 'cause this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna rescue her.
I'm gonna save Rose Tyler from the middle of the Dalek Fleet.
And then I'm gonna save the Earth. And then, just to finish off, I'm gonna wipe every last stinking Dalek out of the sky!
<i>But you have no weapons!</i> <i>No defences! No plan!</i> Yeah. And doesn't that scare you to death?
Rose?
Yes, Doctor?
<i>I'm coming to get you.</i> <i>The Doctor is initiating hostile action.</i> <i>The Stratagem must advance.</i> <i>Begin the invasion of Earth.</i> <i>The Doctor will be extermlnated.</i> <i>Exterminate. Extermlnate...</i> <i>Launch missiles. Extermlnate.</i> We've got incoming. This is it, ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.
<i>There's an army</i> <i>about to invade this statlon.</i> Defences have gone off line.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
<i>You are the Weakest Link.</i> This isn't just a game.
There's something else going on.
 We have contestants outside of the games.
 The games continue.
<i>This Is Satellite Five.</i> 10,000 channels. All beaming down from here.
<i>My Masters, they fear the Doctor.</i> Tell me, who are they?
I saw you die!
<i>- That's imposslble.</i>  <i>- They were destroyed.</i> Obviously they survived.
<i>We have your assoclate.</i> <i>You will obey or she will be extermlnated.</i>  Rose?
 Yes, Doctor.
<i>I'm coming to get you.</i> <i>You know the Doctor. You understand him.</i> <i>- You will predict his actions.</i>  I don't know!
 And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. <i>- Predict Predict! Predict!</i> <i>Tardis detected in flight.</i> <i>- Launch missiles! Exterminate!</i>  You can't!
The Tardis hasn't got any defences. You're gonna kill him.
<i>You have predicted correctly.</i> We've got incoming!
The extrapolator's working. We've got a fully functional force-field.
 Try saying that when you're drunk.
 And for my next trick...
Rose, get down!
 Get down, Rose! <i>- Exterminate!</i> You did it.
 Feels like I haven't seen you in years.
 I told you I'd come and get you.
 Never doubted it.
 I did. You all right?
 Yeah. And you?
 Not bad. Been better.
 Don't I get a hug?
 Oh, come here.
I was talking to him. Welcome home.
Oh! I thought I'd never see you again.
You were lucky, that was just a one-shot wonder.
Drained the gun of all its power supply. Now it's just a piece of junk.
<i>Patience, my brethren.</i>  You said they were extinct.
 How come they're still alive?
One minute they're the greatest threat in the universe, the next minute they vanished out of time and space.
They went off to fight a bigger war.
The Time War.
 I thought that was just a legend.
 I was there.
The war between the Daleks and the Time Lords, with the whole of creation at stake.
My people were destroyed but they took the Daleks with them.
I almost thought it was worth it.
And now it turns out they died for nothing.
There's thousands of them now. We could hardly stop one.
What are we gonna do?
No good stood round here chinwagging. Human race, you'd gossip all day.
The Daleks have got the answers. Let's go and meet the neighbours.
You can't go out there!
<i>- Exterminate!</i> <i>- Exterminate!</i> Is that it? Useless. Null points!
It's all right, come on out. That force-field can hold back anything.
Almost anything.
Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them that. Thanks.
Sorry.
Do you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the Dalek homeworld?
The Oncoming Storm.
You might have removed all your emotions, but I reckon right down deep in your DNA, there's one little spark left. And that's fear.
Doesn't it just burn when you face me?
So tell me, how did you survive the Time War?
<i>They survived through me.</i> Rose. Captain.
This is the Emperor of the Daleks.
<i>You destroyed us, Doctor.</i> <i>The Dalek race died in your inferno.</i> <i>But my ship survived, falling through time,</i> <i>crippled but allve.</i>  I get it... <i>- Do not interrupt!</i> <i>- Do not interrupt!</i> <i>- Do not interrupt!</i> I think you're forgetting something.
I'm the Doctor and if there's one thing I can do, it's talk.
I've got five billion languages and you haven't got one way of stopping me.
So if anybody's gonna shut up, it's you!
Okie-doke. So, where were we?
<i>We waited here, in the dark space,</i> <i>damaged but rebulldlng.</i> <i>Centuries passed</i> <i>and we quietly infiltrated</i> <i>the systems of Earth,</i> <i>harvesting the waste of humanlty.</i> <i>The prisoners, the refugees,</i> <i>the dispossessed, they all came to us.</i> <i>The bodies were filleted, pulped, slfted.</i> <i>The seed of the human race is perverted.</i> <i>Only one cell in a billion</i> <i>was fit to be nurtured.</i> So you created an army of Daleks out of the dead.
That makes them half human.
<i>Those words are blasphemy</i> <i>- Do not blaspheme!</i> <i>- Do not blaspheme!</i> <i>Do not blaspheme!</i> <i>Everything human has been purged.</i> <i>I cultivated</i> <i>pure and blessed Dalek.</i> Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy?
<i>I reached into the dirt and made new Ilfe.</i> <i>I am the God of all Daleks!</i> <i>- Worship him!</i> <i>- Worship him!</i> <i>Worship him!</i> They're insane.
Hiding in silence for hundreds of years, that's enough to drive anyone mad.
But it's worse than that.
Driven mad by your own flesh.
The stink of humanity.
You hate your own existence.
And that makes them more deadly than ever.
 We're going. <i>- You may not leave my presence!</i> <i>- Stay where you are!</i> <i>- Exterminate!</i> <i>- Exterminate!</i> <i>- Exterminate!</i> <i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i> <i>- Worship him!</i> <i>- Worship him!</i> <i>You will be exterminated!</i> Turn everything up! All transmitters, full power, wide open, now! Do it!
What does this do?
Stops the Daleks from transmatting on board.
How did you get on? Did you contact Earth?
I tried to warn them, but all they did was suspend our licence 'cause we stopped the programmes.
And the planet's just sitting there. Defenceless.
Lynda, what are you still doing on board? I told you to evacuate everyone!
 She wouldn't go.
 I didn't wanna leave you.
There weren't enough shuttles anyway or I wouldn't be here.
We've got about 100 people stranded on Floor Zero.
Listen, my name's Rodrick. I won the game, where's my money?
<i>Is anyone listening? Where's my money?</i> Oh, my God. The Fleet is moving.
They're on their way!
<i>Purify the Earth with flre.</i> <i>The planet will become my temple</i> <i>and we shall rlse.</i> <i>This will be our paradise!</i> Dalek plan, big mistake, 'cause what've they left me with?
Anyone? Anyone? Come on, it's obvious!
A great big transmitter. This station!
If I can change the signal, fold it back, sequence it? Anyone?
 You've got to be kidding.
 Give the man a medal!
 A Delta Wave?
 A Delta Wave!
 What's a Delta Wave?
 A wave of Van Cassadyne energy.
It fries your brain.
Stand in the way of a Delta Wave and your head gets barbecued.
And this place can transmit a massive wave. Wipe out the Daleks!
Get started and do it, then!
Trouble is, wave this size, building this big, brain as clever as mine, should take about three days.
 How long till the Fleet arrive?
 22 minutes.
We've now got a force-field, so they can't blast us out of the sky.
But that doesn't stop the Daleks from physically invading.
 Do they know about the Delta Wave?
 They'll have worked it out at the same time.
So, they want to stop the Doctor.
That means they've got to get to this level, 500.
Now, I can concentrate the extrapolator on the top six levels, 500 to 495.
So they'll penetrate the station below that at level 494 and fight their way up.
 Who are they fighting?
 Us.
What are we fighting with?
The guards had guns with bastic bullets, that's enough to blow a Dalek wide open.
There's five of us.
Rose, you can help me. I need all these wires stripping bare.
 Right, now there's four of us.
 Then let's move it!
Into the lift, isolate the lift controls.
I just wanna say... thanks, I suppose.
 And I'll do my best.
 Me, too.
It's been fun.
 But I guess this is goodbye.
 Don't talk like that.
The Doctor's gonna do it, you just watch him.
Rose.
You are worth fighting for.
Wish I'd never met you, Doctor.
I was much better off as a coward.
See you in hell.
He's gonna be all right, isn't he?
One last time! Any more volunteers?
There's an army about to invade this station.
I need every last citizen to mount a defence.
Don't listen to him! There aren't any Daleks.
They disappeared thousands of years ago.
Thanks. As for the rest of you, the Daleks will enter the station at Floor 494, and as far as I can tell, they'll head up, not down. But that's not a promise.
So here's a few words of advice.
Keep quiet.
And if you hear fighting up above, if you hear us dying...
then tell me that the Daleks aren't real.
Don't make a sound.
Let's go.
Suppose...
 What?
 Nothing.
 You said suppose.
 No, I was just thinking.
I mean, obviously you can't, but you've got a time machine.
Why can't you just go back to last week and warn them?
Soon as the Tardis lands, in that second, I become part of events.
Stuck in the timeline.
Yeah, I thought it'd be something like that.
There's another thing the Tardis could do. It could take us away. We could leave.
Let history take its course. We go to Marbella in 1989.
 Yeah, but you'd never do that.
 No, but you could ask.
 Never even occurred to you, did it?
 Well, I'm just too good.
The Delta Wave's started building. How long does it need?
Is that bad?
Okay, it's bad. How bad is it?
Rose Tyler, you're a genius! We can do it!
If I use the Tardis to cross my own timeline... Yes!
Hold that down and keep position.
 What's it do?
 Cancels the buffers.
If I'm very clever, and I'm more than clever, I'm brilliant, I might just save the world. Or rip it apart.
 I'd go for the first one.
 Me, too.
Now, I've just got to go and power up the Game Station. Hold on!
Doctor, what are you doing? Can I take my hand off? It's moving.
Doctor, let me out!
Let me out!
Doctor, what have you done?
<i>This is Emergency Programme One.</i> <i>Rose, now listen, this is important.</i> <i>If this message is activated</i> <i>then it can only mean one thlng.</i> <i>We must be in danger. And I mean fatal.</i> <i>I'm dead or about to die any second</i> <i>with no chance of escape.</i>  No! <i>- And that's okay. Hope it's a good death.</i> <i>But I promised to look after you</i> <i>and that's what I'm dolng.</i> <i>- The Tardis is taking you home.</i>  I won't let you!
<i>And I bet you're fussing and moaning now.</i> <i>Typical</i> <i>But hold on and just listen a bit more.</i> <i>The Tardis can never return for me.</i> <i>Emergency Programme One means</i> <i>I'm facing an enemy that should never get</i> <i>their hands on this machlne.</i> <i>So this is what you should do,</i> <i>let the Tardis dle.</i> <i>Just let this old box gather dust. No one</i> <i>can open it, no one will even notice it.</i> <i>Let it become a strange little thing</i> <i>standing on a street corner.</i> <i>And over the years the world will move on</i> <i>and the box will be burled.</i> <i>And if you want to remember me,</i> <i>then you can do one thlng.</i> <i>That's all. One thlng.</i> <i>Have a good life.</i> <i>Do that for me, Rose. Have a fantastic life.</i> You can't do this to me. You can't.
Take me back! Take me back!
No!
Come on, fly. How do you fly?
Come on, help me!
I knew it!
I was all the way down Clifton Parade and I heard the engines.
I thought, "There's only one thing that makes a noise like that." What is it?
Rose, I've called up the internal laser codes.
<i>There should be a different number on</i> <i>every screen. Can you read them out to me?</i>  She's not here.
 Of all the times to take a leak!
<i>When she gets back,</i> <i>tell her to read me the codes.</i>  She's not coming back.
 What do you mean? Where did she go?
 Just get on with your work. <i>- You took her home, didn't you?</i> Yeah.
The Delta Wave. Is it ever gonna be ready?
<i>Tell him the truth, Doctor.</i> <i>There is every possibility the Delta Wave</i> <i>could be complete</i> <i>but no possibility of refining it.</i> <i>The Delta Wave must kill</i> <i>every living thing in its path,</i> <i>with no distinction</i> <i>between human and Dalek.</i> <i>All thing will die. By your hand.</i> <i>Doctor, the range of this transmitter</i> <i>covers the entire Earth.</i> <i>You would destroy</i> <i>Daleks and humans together.</i> <i>If I am God,</i> <i>the creator of all things,</i> <i>then what does that make you, Doctor?</i> There are colonies out there.
The human race would survive in some shape or form.
But you're the only Daleks in existence.
The whole universe is in danger if I let you live.
Do you see, Jack?
That's the decision I've got to make for every living thing.
Die as a human or live as a Dalek.
 What would you do? <i>- You sent her home. She's safe.</i> <i>- Keep worklng.</i> <i>- But he will exterminate you!</i> Never doubted him, never will.
Now, you tell me, God of all Daleks, 'cause there's one thing I never worked out. The words, "Bad Wolf", spread across time and space, everywhere, drawing me in.
 How did you manage that? <i>- I did nothlng.</i> Come on, there's no secrets now, Your Worship.
<i>They are not part of my deslgn.</i> <i>This is the truth of God.</i>  And it's gone upmarket, this place.
 They're doing little tubs of coleslaw now.
It's not very nice. It tastes a bit sort of clinical.
Have you tried that new pizza place on Minto Road?
 What's it selling?
 Pizza.
 That's nice. Do they deliver?
 Yeah.
Oh, Rose, have something to eat.
200,000 years in the future he's dying and there's nothing I can do.
Like you said, 200,000 years, it's way off.
But it's not, it's now.
That fight is happening right now. And he's fighting for us!
For the whole planet! And I'm just sitting here eating chips!
Listen to me. God knows I've hated that man, but right now I love him and do you know why?
'Cause he did the right thing. He sent you back to me.
What do I do every day, Mum? What do I do?
Get up, catch the bus, go to work, come back home,  eat chips and go to bed, is that it?
 That's what the rest of us do.
 I can't.
 Why, 'cause you're better than us?
No, I didn't mean that!
But it was...
It was a better life.
I don't mean all the travelling and...
seeing aliens and spaceships and things, that don't matter.
The Doctor showed me a better way of living your life.
You know he showed you, too.
That you don't just give up. You don't just let things happen.
You make a stand. You say no.
You have the guts to do what's right when everyone else just runs away!
And I just can't...
Right, Lynda, you are my eyes and ears.
When the Daleks get in, you can follow them on that screen and report it to me.
 Understood.
 They'll detect you.
The door is made of hydra combination, it should keep them out.
 Should?
 It's the best I can do.
How long till the Fleet arrives?
<i>They accelerated.</i> This is it! Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.
You can't spend the rest of your life thinking about the Doctor.
 But how do I forget him?
 You've got to start living your own life.
A proper life. Like the kind he's never had. The sort of life that you could have with me.
Over here, it's over here as well!
That's been there for years. It's just a phrase, it's just words!
I thought it was a warning. Maybe it's the opposite.
Maybe it's a message.
The same words written down now and 200,000 years in the future.
It's a link between me and the Doctor. Bad Wolf here, Bad Wolf there.
Yeah, but if it's a message, what's it saying?
It's telling me I can get back. The least I can do is help him escape!
Stand your ground, everyone. Follow my commands. And good luck.
You were right. They're forcing the air lock on 494.
All the Tardis needs to do is make a return trip. Just reverse.
Yeah, but we still can't do it.
The Doctor always said the Tardis was telepathic.
This thing is alive, it can listen.
 It's not listening now, is it?
 We need to get inside it.
Last time I saw you, with the Slitheen, this middle bit opened.
<i>And there was this light</i> <i>and the Doctor said</i> <i>it was the heart of the Tardis.</i> If we can open it, I can make contact. I can tell it what to do.
 Rose, if you go back, you're gonna die.
 That's a risk I've got to take.
'Cause there's nothing left for me here.
 Nothing?
 No.
Okay, if that's what you think, let's get this thing open.
<i>- Okay, activate internal lasers.</i>  <i>- Slice them up.</i> Defences have gone offline. The Daleks have overridden the lot.
You lied to me! The bullets don't work!
Faster!
Come on!
It's not moving!
Advance guard have made it to 495.
 Jack, how are we doing?
 495 should be good. I like 495.
<i>Identify yourself</i> <i>You are the Weakest Link. Goodbye!</i> Yes!
<i>You are the Weakest Llnk...</i> <i>Goodbye.</i> <i>Proceed to next level.</i> They're flying up the ventilation shafts. No, wait a minute.
Oh, my God. Why are they doing that? They're going down.
<i>Exterminate! Extermlnate...</i> <i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i> You can't! You don't exist!
It's not fair! I won the game! I should be rich!
 I'm a winner! You can't do this to me! <i>- Exterminate!</i> Floor Zero. They killed them all.
It was never gonna work, sweetheart.
And the Doctor knew that. He just wanted you to be safe.
 I can't give up.
 Lock the door. Walk away.
 Dad wouldn't give up.
 He's not here, is he?
 And even if he was, he'd say the same.
 No, he wouldn't.
He'd tell me to try anything.
If I could save the Doctor's life, try anything.
 We're never gonna know.
 Well, I know. 'Cause I met him.
 I met Dad.
 Don't be ridiculous.
The Doctor took me back in time and I met Dad.
Don't say that.
You remember when Dad died, there was someone with him?
A girl, a blonde girl. She held his hand.
You saw her from a distance, Mum, you saw her.
Think about it. That was me. You saw me.
 Stop it!
 That's how good the Doctor...
Stop it! Just stop it!
 Lynda, what's happening on Earth?
 The Fleet's descending.
They're bombing whole continents.
Europa, Pacifica, the New American Alliance.
Australasia's just, er... gone.
<i>This is perfectlon.</i> <i>I have created heaven on Earth.</i> Floor 499, we're the last defence.
The bullets should work if you concentrate them on the Daleks' eyestalk.
I've got the force-field at maximum, so Dalek firepower should be at its weakest.
I'm only here 'cause of you.
I joined the Programme 'cause you were on it.
Am I supposed to say, "When this is all over, "if we're still alive, maybe we could go for a drink?"  That'd be nice.
 Yeah, well, tough.
There's gotta be something else we can do.
Mum was right. Maybe we should just lock the door and walk away.
I'm not having that.
I'm not having you just give up now, no way.
We just need something stronger than my car.
Something bigger, something like that.
Right, you've only got this until 6:00, so get on with it.
 Mum, where the hell did you get that from?
 Rodrigo. He owes me a favour.
Never mind why. But you were right about your dad, sweetheart.
He was full of mad ideas and it's exactly what he would have done.
Now, get on with it before I change my mind.
Open fire!
It's not working!
Concentrate your fire. Eyestalk 2:00!
<i>Eye vision is impaired! I cannot see!</i> We did it!
No. No!
I've got a problem.
<i>Human female detected.</i>  They've found me.
 You'll be all right, Lynda.
That side of the station's reinforced against meteors.
Hope so.
You know what they say about Earth workmanship.
Last man standing!
For God's sake, Doctor, finish that thing and kill them!
<i>Finish that thing and kill manklnd.</i>  Keep going!
 Put your foot down!
 Faster!
 Give it some more, Mickey!
Keep going!
Come on! Come on!
 Keep going!
 Give it some more!
Rose!
Doctor! You've got 20 seconds maximum.
<i>- Exterminate!</i>  I kind of figured that.
It's ready!
You really wanna think about this.
'Cause if I activate the signal, every living creature dies.
<i>I am immortal.</i>  Do you wanna put that to the test? <i>- I want to see you become like me.</i> <i>Hall the Doctor, the Great Extermlnator.</i>  I'll do it! <i>- Then prove yourself, Doctor!</i> <i>What are you? Coward or killer?</i> Coward.
Any day.
<i>Mankind will be harvested</i> <i>because of your weakness.</i> And what about me? Am I becoming one of your angels?
<i>You are the heathen.</i> <i>You will be exterminated.</i> Maybe it's time.
<i>Alert! Tardis materialising!</i> <i>You will not escape</i>  What have you done?
 I looked into the Tardis.
 And the Tardis looked into me.
 You looked into the time vortex.
Rose, no one's meant to see that.
<i>This is the Abomination!</i> <i>Exterminate!</i> I am the Bad Wolf. I create myself.
I take the words...
I scatter them in time and space.
A message to lead myself here.
Rose, you've got to stop this! You've got to stop this now!
You've got the entire vortex running through your head. You're gonna burn!
I want you safe.
My Doctor.
Protected from the false god.
<i>You cannot hurt me! I am immortal!</i> You are tiny.
I can see the whole of time and space.
Every single atom of your existence and I divide them.
Everything must come to dust.
All things. Everything dies.
 The Time War ends. <i>- I will not die!</i> <i>I cannot die!</i> Rose, you've done it, now stop.
Just let go!
How can I let go of this?
I bring life.
But this is wrong!
 You can't control life and death!
 But I can.
The sun and the moon, the day and night.
But why do they hurt?
The power's gonna kill you. And it's my fault!
I can see everything.
All that is, all that was.
All that ever could be.
That's what I see. All the time.
 And doesn't it drive you mad?
 My head.
 Come here.
 It's killing me.
I think you need a doctor.
 What happened?
 Don't you remember?
It's like...
There was this singing.
That's right, I sang a song and the Daleks ran away.
I was at home. No, I wasn't. I was in the Tardis and...
there was this light.
I can't remember anything else.
Rose Tyler.
I was gonna take you to so many places. Barcelona, not the city Barcelona, the planet Barcelona, you'd love it.
Fantastic place. They've got dogs with no noses.
Imagine how many times a day you end up telling that joke and it's still funny!
Then why can't we go?
Maybe you will, and maybe I will, but not like this.
You're not making sense.
I might never make sense again. I might have two heads or no head!
Imagine me with no head. And don't say that's an improvement!
But it's a bit dodgy this process.
You never know what you're gonna end up with.
 Doctor!
 Stay away!
Doctor, tell me what's going on.
I absorbed all the energy of the time vortex and no one's meant to do that.
Every cell in my body is dying.
 Can't you do something?
 Yeah, I'm doing it now!
Time Lords have this little trick. It's sort of a way of cheating death.
Except...
it means I'm gonna change...
and I'm not gonna see you again.
Not like this, not with this daft old face.
 And before I go...
 Don't say that!
Rose...
before I go I just wanna tell you, you were fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
And do you know what?
So was I.
Hello, okay.
New teeth, that's weird. So, where was I?
Oh, that's right, Barcelona!  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
RADIO: # Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer? # Turn that down!
Turn it off! Steve-o, turn it off.
Joe, shut up!
TARDIS WHOOSHES TARDIS WHOOSHES Rose!
Mickey! Jackie, it's the TARDIS!
I know, I heard it! She's alive, Mickey! I said so, didn't I? She's alive! Shut up a minute.
Where is it, then?
JACKIE SCREAMS Here we are, then. London, Earth, the Solar System. I did it!
Jackie! Mickey!
Blimey! No, no, no, hold on.
Wait there. What was I gonna say?
There was something I had to tell you, something important. What was it? Hold on, hold on.
Hold on. Shh.
Oh! I know!
Merry Christmas!
What happened? Is he all right? I dunno, he just keeled over. But where's the Doctor? That's him.
Right in front of you. That's the Doctor.
What d'you mean, "That's the Doctor"? Doctor who?
Here we go.
Tina the Cleaner's got this lodger, medical student, and she was fast asleep, so I just took it.
I still say we should take him to a hospital. They'd lock him up. They'd dissect him.
One bottle of his blood could change the future of the human race. Now shush!
HEARTBEAT SOUNDS HEARTBEAT SOUNDS Both working. What d'you mean, "both"?
He's got two hearts. Oh, don't be stupid. He has.
Anything else he's got two of? Leave him alone!
How can he go changing his face?
Is that a different face or is he a different person?
How should I know?
Sorry.
The thing is... I thought I knew him, Mum.
I thought me and him were...
Then he goes and does this.
I keep forgetting he's not human.
The big question is, where did you get a pair of men's pyjamas from?!
Howard's been staying over. What? Howard from the market? How long's that been going on?
A month or so. First, he starts delivering to the door. I thought, "That's odd." Next thing you know, there's a bag of oranges... Is that Harriet Jones? Never mind me!
Why's she on telly? She's Prime Minister now! I'm 18 quid a week better off.
They're calling it Britain's golden age. I keep on saying, "My Rose has met her." Did more than that. Stopped World War Three with her.
Harriet Jones.
What about those calling the Guinevere One Space Probe a waste of money? I completely disagree.
The Guinevere One Space Probe represents this country's limitless ambition.
British workmanship, sailing up there among the stars.
This is the spirit of Christmas, birth, and rejoicing, and the dawn of a new age.
That is what we're achieving, 50 million miles away.
Our very own miracle!
The unmanned probe Guinevere One is about to make its final descent.
Photographs of the Martian landscape should be received by midnight tonight.
What d'you need, 20 quid?
D'you mind? I'll pay you back. Call it a Christmas present.
God, I'm all out of sync.
You just forget about Christmas and things in the TARDIS.
They don't exist. You get sort of... timeless.
That's fascinating(!) I love hearing stories about the TARDIS(!) Go on, tell us another, I could listen to it all day(!) TARDIS this, TARDIS that... Shut up!
Ooh, and one time, the TARDIS landed in a big yellow garden, full of balloons!
I'm not like that! You so are!
Must drive you mad. Surprised you don't give up on me.
That's the thing, isn't it? You can rely on me. I don't go changing my face. Yeah.
What if he's dying? OK... Sorry!
Just let it be Christmas. Can you do that?
Just for a bit? You, me and Christmas.
No Doctor, no bog-monsters, no life or death.
OK.
Promise? Yes!
Right. What are you gonna get for your mum?
I'm round there all the time now. She does my dinner on a Sunday.
She talks about you all afternoon. Yap, yap, yap, yap...
A nice pen in a box.
BAND PLAYS: "God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen" It's us! They're after us.
What's going on? What have we done? Why are they after us?!
Taxi!
They're after the Doctor.
I can't even go shopping with you! We get attacked by a brass band! Who are you phoning? My mum.
She turns up, no warning, I've got nothing in.
I said, "Rose, if you want a Christmas dinner of meat paste, then so be it..." Get off the phone!
Who were those Santa things?
I dunno, but think about it. They were after us. What's important about us?
Nothing, except we've got the Doctor!
No, don't come round.
The flat's all topsy-turvy.
She just barges in and litters the place.
Yeah, I'll come and see you Boxing Day.
So save us a chipolata...
Get off the phone! It's only Bev. She says hello.
Bev? Look, it'll have to wait.
It's not safe. We've gotta get out. Where can we go?
My mate Stan will put us up. That's only two streets away. Where's Mo now?
I  dunno, the Peak District. We'll go to Cousin Mo's, then.
It's Christmas Eve, we're not going anywhere!
What are you babbling about? Mum.
Where did you get that tree? That's a new tree.
Where did you get it? I thought it was you.
How can it be me? You went shopping.
There was a ring at the door, and there it was.  That wasn't me.
Then who was it?
You're kidding me.
"JINGLE BELLS" PLAYS JACKIE  SCREAMS Go, go! Get out!
We've gotta save the Doctor. What are you doing? We can't leave him.
Mickey!
Leave it. Get out, get out! Mickey!
Get out of there!
No, leave him, just leave him. Get in here!
Doctor, wake up!
I'm gonna get killed by a Christmas tree!
Help me.
Remote control.
But who's controlling it?
That's them. What are they?
They've just gone!
What kind of rubbish were they?
They're not much cop if a sonic screwdriver scares them off.
Pilot fish. What?
They were just pilot fish.
HE COUGHS Aaargh!
What's wrong?
You woke me up too soon.
I'm still regenerating. I'm bursting with energy.
You see? The pilot fish could smell it, a million miles away, so they eliminate the defence  you lot  then carry me off.
They could run their batteries off me for a couple of years...
My head! I'm having a neuron implosion. I need...
What d'you need? Tell me. I need... Painkillers? D'you need aspirin?
I need... Codeine? Paracetamol? Pepto-Bismol?
Liquid paraffin? Vitamin C? Vitamin D? Vitamin E?
Is it food? Something simple? A bowl of soup? A nice bowl of soup.
Soup and a sandwich? Soup and a little ham sandwich? I need you to shut up.
He hasn't changed that much, has he?
We haven't got much time.
If there's pilot fish, then...
Why's there an apple in my dressing gown? That's Howard, sorry.
He keeps apples in his dressing gown? He gets hungry.
He gets hungry in his sleep? Sometimes.
Graaaargh! Aaargh!
Brain, collapsing!
But the pilot fish...
The pilot fish mean that something...
Something...
Something's coming.
Jackie, I'm using the phone line. Is that OK? Keep account of it.
It's midnight.
Christmas Day. Any change?
He's worse. Just one heart beating.
TV: Scientists in charge of Britain's mission to Mars have re-established contact with the Guinevere One Space Probe.
They're expecting the first transmission from the planet in the next few minutes.
We're back on schedule.
We've received a signal from Guinevere One.
The Mars landing would seem to be an unqualified success.
Is it true you completely lost contact earlier tonight?
Yes, we had a bit of a scare.
Guinevere  seemed to fall off the scope, but it was just a blip, only disappeared for a few seconds.
She's fine now, absolutely fine.
We're getting the first pictures, transmitted live, any minute now.
I'd better get back to it, thanks.
Here we go, pilot fish.
They're scavengers, like he said. Harmless, they're just tiny.
But the little fish swim alongside the big fish.
D'you mean like sharks? Big sharks.
The Doctor means we've had them, now we get that.
Something is coming.
How close?
I don't know, but the pilot fish don't swim far from the daddy. So it's close?
Funny sort of rocks.
That's not rocks.
TV: Coming live from the depths of space on Christmas morn.
IT ROARS The face of an alien life was transmitted live tonight on BBC One.
On the 25th of December, the human race has been shown absolute proof that alien life exists.
These remarkable images have been relayed across the world.
This way, sir.
Mr Llewellyn.
Mr Llewellyn, ma'am. Harriet Jones, Prime Minister.
Yes, I know who you are. Suppose I've ruined your Christmas.
Never off duty. Now, we've put out a cover story, Alex has been handling it.
We've said it was a hoax, some sort of mask or prosthetics, students hijacking the signal, that sort of thing.
Alex is my right-hand man. I'm not used to having a right-hand man. I quite like it, though.   So do I.
I don't suppose there is any chance it was a hoax? That would be nice. Then we could all go home.
I don't suppose anyone's offered you a coffee? Um, no. The transmission was genuine.
And this seems to be a new species of alien. At least, not one we've encountered before.
You seem to be talking about aliens as a matter of fact.
There's an Act of Parliament banning my autobiography. Prime Minister? I'm with you.
Miss Jacobs can explain.
We haven't been introduced. Harriet Jones, Prime Minister. Yes, I know who you are.
The transmission didn't come from the surface of Mars.
Guinevere One was broadcasting from a point 5,000 miles above the planet.
In other words, they've got a ship, and the probe is on board.
But if they're not from the surface, they might not be from Mars. Maybe they're not actual Martians.
Of course not. Martians look completely different.
We think the ship was in flight when they just came across the probe. And they're moving.
The ship's still in flight now. It's on the Hubble Array.
Moving in which direction? Towards us. How fast?
Very fast. What was your name again?
Sally.
Thank you, Sally.
Rose! Take a look. I've got access to the military.
They're tracking a spaceship. It's big, fast and coming this way.
Coming for what? The Doctor?!
I don't know. Maybe it's coming for all of us.
Gatz tak ka thaa! Ka zu me fedrok, ka zu me Sycorax!

Translation software.
Yes, sir.
Di-ga gah!
I don't understand what they're saying.
The TARDIS translates alien languages, inside my head, all the time, wherever I am.
So why isn't it doing it now?
I dunno. Must be the Doctor.
Like he's part of the circuit, and he's...
. he's broken.
I'm getting demands from Washington, ma'am.
The  President is insisting that he takes control of the situation.
You can tell the President, and please use these exact words, he's not my boss, and he's certainly not turning this into a war.
What have we got? Nothing yet. Translating an alien language is going to take time.
How far off is the ship?
About five hours.
Despite claims of an alien hoax, it's been reported that NATO forces are on red alert.
Come on, sweetheart.
What do you need?
What is it you need? Tell me.
Speaking strictly off the record, government sources are calling this our longest night.
I don't suppose we've had a Code Nine?
No sign of the Doctor? Nothing yet.
You've met him, haven't you?
More like the stuff of legend. He is that.
Failing him...
What about Torchwood?
I'm not supposed to know about it, I realise that. Not even the UN knows.
But if ever there was a need for Torchwood, it's now. I can't take responsibility. I can.
See to it. Get them ready.
Prime Minister? Has it worked? Just about.
"People,"  that could be cattle, "you belong to us, to the Sycorax." They seem to be called Sycorax, not Martians.
"We own you. We now possess your land, your minerals, your precious stones.
"You will surrender or they will die. Sycorax strong, Sycorax mighty. Sycorax rock," as in the modern sense, "They rock!" "THEY will die." Not "YOU will die," "THEY will die." Who's they?
I don't know, but it is the right personal pronoun. It's "they".
Send them a reply.
Tell them this is a day of peace on Planet Earth.
Tell them we extend that peace to the Sycorax.
And then tell them this planet is armed, and we do not surrender.
The Doctor wouldn't do this, the old Doctor, the proper Doctor.
He'd wake up. He'd save us.
You really love him, don't you?
They got the message.
Here comes the response.
HISSING What was that?
Was that a reply?
I don't know. Looked like some sort of energy, or static?
Almost like someone casting a spell.
Maybe it's a different form of language, some sort of ideogram or pictogram, or...
What the hell?
It's the light. It's the same light.
Sally? What are you doing? Sally?
Leave her, you'll hurt her. Let them pass! Where are they going?
What is wrong with you?
Jason?
Jason?! Sandra!
He won't listen. He's just walking.
He won't stop walking.
There's a sort of light thing.
Jason!
Stop it! Right now.
Please, Jason.
They're all heading in the same direction.
But it's only certain people. Why isn't it affecting us?
It's happening all over the country.
Alan, stop this! It's not funny any more. Come back inside the house!
Catrin, listen to Mummy, come back inside now. And you Jonathan!
Come back in with Mummy.
Jonathan, come back in with Mummy. You're scaring me now, come on! Alan, help me out here, please!
As far as I can tell, they're heading for any sort of high-rise building.
Anything with stairs, anything with steps.
They're going all the way up. They're going to the roof.
Just making my way to the front of the building. There's hundreds of them.
Oh, my God, they're going right up to the edge. They're all gonna jump!
Sally, stop it!
It's Danny Llewellyn, Daniel Llewellyn.
Sally, just concentrate. You're being controlled.
We need you.
Stop it, Sally!
Jason, I'm talking to you.
Just stop!
It's not just the whole country.
It's the whole world.
They've stopped. They've all stopped.
They're just standing there. Right on the edge.
According to reports, it's like a third.
One third of the world's population, two billion people, ready to jump.
Surrender or they will die.
What do we do?
Nothing.
There's no-one to save us. Not any more.
Wait a minute. There is a pattern.
All these people tend to be father and son, mother and daughter, brothers and sisters.
Family groups, but not husbands and wives. Oh, my God.
It's Guinevere One.
Have you got medical records for all your staff?
Of course we have, yes.
What about Torchwood?
Still working on it.
Bear in mind, they just lost a third of their staff. But they do have what we need?
Yes, ma'am.
Tell them to hurry up.
Here it is! Sally Jacobs, blood group, A Positive.
Who else walked out? Luke Parsons.
Luke Parsons, A Positive!
Geoffrey Baxter.
Baxter, A Positive. That's it.
They're all A Positive. How many people in the world are A Positive? No idea, but I bet it's one third.
What's so special about that blood group? Nothing, but...
It's my fault. Guinevere One, it's got one of those plaques, identifying the human race.
A  message to the stars.
You don't expect anything to come of it, but I put on maps and music and samples.
There's wheat seeds and water and...
And blood.
A Positive.
The Sycorax have got a vial of A Positive, and, I don't know how, but through that... They control the blood.
Oh, my God. There's only one more thing I can try. Major! With me!
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may take a moment during this terrible time.
It's hardly the Queen's speech. I'm afraid that's been cancelled.
Did we ask about the Royal Family?
Oh...
they're on the roof.
But, ladies and gentlemen, this crisis is unique, and I'm afraid to say it might get much worse.
I would ask you all to remain calm.
But I have one request.
Doctor?
If you're out there, we need you.
I don't know what to do.
If you can hear me, Doctor, if anyone knows the Doctor, if anyone can find him, the situation has never been more desperate.
Help us.
Please, Doctor, help us.
He's gone.
The Doctor's gone.
He's left me, Mum.
Left me, Mum.
Sonic wave! It's the spaceship, it's hit the atmosphere!
LOW RUMBLING Mickey, we're gonna carry him.
Mum, get your stuff, and get some food, we're going. Where to?
The TARDIS. It's the only safe place. What are we gonna do in there? Hide. Is that it?
Look in the sky. There's a great big alien invasion and I don't know what to do, OK?
I've travelled with him and seen all that stuff, but when I'm stuck at home, I'm useless.
All we can do is run and hide, and I'm sorry. Now move!
They're transmitting. On screen.

Mum, will you leave that stuff and give us a hand?
It's food. You said we need... Just leave it!
Jal van korast akus bahkta.
"You will surrender, or I will release the final curse, "and your people will jump." If I can speak...
Mr Llewellyn, you're a civilian. No.
I sent out the probe, I made contact with these people.
This whole thing's my responsibility.
With respect, sir.
The human race is taking its first step towards the stars, but we are like children, compared to you.
Children who need help.
Children who need compassion.
I beg of you now. Show that compassion.
Aaaaaaaarrrrgh!
BONES RATTLE That man was your prisoner!
Even your species must have Articles of War forbidding...

"Your choice." IT HISSES No chance you could fly this thing? Not any more. You did it before.
I know, but it's sort of been wiped out of my head, like it's forbidden.
If I try it again, I think the universe rips in half.
Better not, then. Maybe not. What do we do? Just sit here? That's as good as it gets.
Here we go, nice cup of tea. Oh, the solution to everything(!) Stop your moaning. I'll get the rest of the food.
Tea!
It's like we're having a picnic, while the world comes to an end. Very British.
How does this thing work?
If it picks up TV, maybe we can see what's going on.
Maybe we've surrendered. What d'you do to it? It sort of tunes itself.
BEEPING Vebkas fula. Kazful!

They're accusing us of hiding it, conspiring...

Rose!
Maybe it's a distress signal. Fat lot of good that's gonna do. Are you gonna be a misery all the time?
Yes. Look at it from my point of view. Stuck in here with your mum's cooking! Where is she?
I'd better give her a hand. It might start raining missiles out there.
Tell her anything from a tin, that's fine.
Why don't you tell her yourself? I'm not that brave. Oh, I dunno.
ROSE SCREAMS Rose! Get off!
Get off me!
The door. Close the door!

Rose! Rose!
I've got you! My Lord, oh, my precious thing.

No.
We're on our own.

They'll kill you. Never stopped him.

In peace.

Hold on, that's English. He's talking English. You're talking English.
I would never dirty my tongue with your primitive bile!
But that's English! Can you hear English?
Yeah. English. Definitely English.
I speak only Sycoraxic!
If I can hear English, then it's being translated, which means it's working, which means...
Did you miss me?
Rrrraaaargh!
You could have someone's eye out with that! How dare...
You just can't get the staff. Now you, just wait!
I'm busy.
Mickey, hello!
And Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North.
Blimey, it's like This Is Your Life. Tea!
That's all I needed, good cup of tea, a superheated infusion of free radicals and tannin.
Just the thing to heal the synapses. Now...
First things first. Be honest...
How do I look? Um...
Different. Good different or bad different?
Just different.
Am I...
ginger?
No, you're just sort of brown.
I wanted to be ginger. I've never been ginger.
And you, Rose Tyler, fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me. Ooh, that's rude.
Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger?
I'm sorry, who is this? I'm the Doctor. He's the Doctor.
What happened to my Doctor? Or is it a title that's just passed on?
I'm him. I'm literally him.
Same man, new face. Well, new everything.
But you can't be... Harriet Jones.
We were trapped in Downing Street, and the thing that scared you wasn't the aliens, wasn't the war, it was the thought of your mother being on her own. Oh, my God!
Did you win the election? Landslide majority.
If I might interrupt...
Yes, sorry. Hello, big fella.
Who exactly are you?
Well, that's the question.
I demand to know who you are!
I don't know!
That's the thing. I'm the Doctor, but beyond that, I just don't know.
I literally do not know who I am.
It's all untested. Am I funny?
Am I sarcastic? Sexy?
A right old misery? Life and soul? Right handed, left handed?
A gambler, a fighter, a coward, a traitor, a liar, a nervous wreck?
Judging by the evidence, I've certainly got a gob.
And how am I going to react when I see this?
A great big threatening button.
A Great Big Threatening Button Which Must Not Be Pressed Under Any Circumstances, am I right?
Let me guess, it's some sort of control matrix. Hold on, what's feeding it?
What have we got here?
Blood?
Definitely blood, human blood, A Positive, with just a dash of iron.
But that means...
Blood control. Blood control!
Oh, I haven't seen blood control for years!
You're controlling all the A Positives!
Which leaves us with a great big stinking problem.
Cos I really don't know who I am.
I don't know when to stop.
So if I see a great big threatening button, which should never, ever, ever be pressed, then I just wanna do this! No!
What the hell am I doing up here?
Get away from the edge!
You killed them! What d'you think, big fella? Are they dead? We allow them to live.
Allow?! You've no choice!
That's all blood control is, a cheap bit of voodoo.
Scary, but that's it. It's like hypnosis. You can hypnotise someone to walk like a chicken but you can't hypnotise them to death. Survival instinct's too strong.
Blood control was just one form of conquest.
I can summon the Armada and take this world by force.
Yeah, you could. You could do that, course you could.
But why?!
Look at these people. These human beings.
Consider their potential.
>From the day they arrive on the planet, and blinking step into the sun, there is more to see than can ever be seen, more to do than... No, hold on.
Sorry, that's the Lion King.
But the point still stands.
Leave them alone. Or what?
Or...
I challenge you!
SYCORAX LAUGH Ohh, that's struck a chord.
Am I right that the sanctified rules of combat still apply?
You stand as this world's champion?
Thank you.
I've no idea who I am, but you've just summed me up.
D'you accept my challenge or are you just a cranak pel casackree salvak?
SYCORAX CHEER For the planet? For the planet!
SYCORAX CHEER Ha haaaaa!
Look out!
Yeah, that helps. I wouldn't have thought of that.
Rrraaaargh!
Bit of fresh air?
Stay back! Invalidate the challenge and he wins the planet.
Yaaargh!
Raaaargh!
You've cut my hand off!
Jah! Sycorax!
And now I know what sort of man I am.
I'm lucky. Cos quite by chance, I'm still within the first 15 hours of my regeneration cycle, which means I've got just enough residual cellular energy to do this.
Witchcraft.
Time Lord.
Doctor!
So I'm still the Doctor, then?
No arguments from me! Wanna know the best bit?
This new hand... It's a fightin' hand!
I win.
Then kill me.
I'll spare your life if you'll take this champion's command.
Leave this planet, and never return.
What do you say? Yes.
Swear on the blood of your species!
I swear.
There we are. Thanks for that. Cheers, big fella.
Bravo! That says it all.
Bravo!
Not bad for a man in his jim-jams.
Very Arthur Dent. Now there was a nice man.
Hold on, what have I got in here? A satsuma!
That friend of your mother's, he does like his snacks.
Doesn't that just sum up Christmas?
You go through all those presents, and right at the end, tucked away at the bottom, there's always one stupid old satsuma.
Who wants a satsuma? Raaaargh!
Aaaaargh!
No second chances. I'm that sort of a man.
By the ancient rites of combat, I forbid you to scavenge here for the rest of time.
And when you go back to the stars and tell others of this planet, when you tell them of its riches its people, its potential...
When you talk of the Earth, make sure that you tell them this 
it is defended.
Where are we?
We're just off Bloxham Road.
We're just round the corner. We did it!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Go on, my son! Oh, yes!
Yes, don't come back!
It is defended!
My Doctor. Prime Minister!
Absolutely the same man.
Are there many more out there?
Not just Sycorax.
Hundreds of species, thousands of 'em.
And the human race is drawing attention to itself.
Every day, you're sending out probes, messages and signals.
This planet's so noisy. You're getting noticed.
More and more.
You'd better get used to it.
Rose! Mum! Talking of trouble. Oh, my God! We did it, mum!
You did it too! It was the tea! Fixed his head!
That's all I needed! Cup of tea! I said so! And look at him!
Is it him, though? Is it really the Doctor?
Oh, my God, it's the bleedin' Prime Minister! Come here, you!
Are you better?
It's a message from Torchwood.
They say they're ready.
You left me. Sorry. And I had all the food!
Tell them to fire.
Fire at will.
What is that? What's happening?
That was murder. That was defence.
It's adapted from alien technology, a ship that fell to Earth ten years ago. But they were leaving!
You said yourself, Doctor, they'd go back to the stars and tell others about the Earth.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but you're not here all the time.
It happened today. Mr Llewellyn and the Major, they were murdered, they died, right in front of me while you were sleeping.
In which case, we have to defend ourselves. Britain's golden age.
It comes with a price. I gave them the wrong warning.
I should have told them to run, as fast as they can, run and hide.
Because the monsters are coming. The human race.
Those are the people I represent. I did it on their behalf.
And I should have stopped you. What does that make you, Doctor?
Another alien threat?
Don't challenge me, Harriet Jones. Cos I'm a completely new man.
I could bring down your government with a single word.
You're the most remarkable man I've ever met.
But I don't think you're quite capable of that.
No, you're right. Not a single word.
Just six. I don't think so. Six words.
Stop it. Six.
Don't you think she looks tired?
What did he say? Nothing really, just...
What did he say?! Nothing, I don't know... Doctor?!
Doctor! What did you...
What was that? What did he say? What did you say, Doctor?!
Doctor!
I'm sorry.
# Well, I woke up today # And the world seemed a restless place # It could have been that way for me # And I wandered around # And thought of your face # That Christmas, looking back at me # Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah # I wish today was just like every other day # Cos today has been the best day # Everything I ever dreamed # And I started to walk # Very soon I will run # And I'll be running back to you # Cos I followed my star # And that's what you are # I've led a merry time with you # Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah... # Oh, that's yours.
# I wish today was just like every other day... # It's pink! It should be yours.
Look, it's Harriet Jones!
TV: Is it true you're no longer fit to be in position?
No. Can we talk about other things?
Is it true you're unfit for office?
There is nothing wrong with my health. I don't know where these stories are coming from and a vote of no confidence is unjustified.
PHONE RINGS Will you resign?
On today of all days, I'm fine. I'm fine! Look at me! I'm fine! I look fine, I feel fine.
It's Bev. She says, "Go and look outside." Why?
I dunno, just go outside and look. Come on, shift!
Wow! Oh!
Wow!
That's beautiful. What are they, meteors?
It's the spaceship. Breaking up in the atmosphere.
This isn't snow, it's ash.
OK, not so beautiful.
And this is a brand-new Planet Earth.
No denying the existence of aliens now, everyone saw it.
Everything's new. What about you? What are you gonna do next?
Well...
Back to the TARDIS. Same old life.
On your own? Don't you want to come? Well, yeah. Do you, though? Yeah.
I just thought...
Cos I changed. I thought, cos you changed, you might not want me any more.
I'd love you to come. OK! You're never gonna stay, are you?
There's just so much out there.
So much to see.
I've got to.
Yeah.
I reckon you're mad.
The pair of you. It's like you go looking for trouble.
Trouble's just the bits in between.
It's all waiting out there, Jackie.
Everything's brand-new to me, all those planets, creatures and horizons.
I haven't seen them yet, not with these eyes.
And it is gonna be...
. fantastic!
That hand of yours still gives me the creeps.
So, where are we gonna go first?
Um...
. that way. No, hold on.
That way. That way?
D'you think?
Yeah, that way.
Where are we going? Further than we've ever gone.
 @@@@@@
@@@@@@
(HIGH PITCHED BUZZING) Have you got everything? I've got everything. Don't worry.
Be careful.
You have to call Mo about...
Never mind Mo, Okay, I'm going now. I love you.
Love you.
Love you.
Bye.
So where are we going?
Further than we've ever gone before.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) It's the year five billion and twenty-three.
We're in the galaxy M87 and this... This is New Earth.
ROSE: It's just...
That's just...
Not bad. Not bad at all.
ROSE: That's amazing.
I'll never get used to this, never.
Different ground beneath my feet. Different sky.
What's that smell?
Apple grass.
Apple grass. It's beautiful.
Oh, I love this.
Can I just say, travelling with you... I love it.
Me, too.
Come on.
Human! She's pure-blood human.
Closer, closer.
So, the year five billion, the sun expands, the Earth gets roasted.
That was our first date.
We had chips.
So anyway, planet gone, all rocks and dust, but the human race lives on, spread out across the stars.
As soon as the Earth burns up, oh, they get all nostalgic.
Big revival movement. They find this place.
Same size as the Earth, same air, same orbit, lovely.
The call goes out, the humans move in.
What's the city called?
New New York, Oh, come on.
It is!
It's the City of New New York.
Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original.
So that makes it New New New New New New New New New New New New New New New York.
What?
You're so different.
New new Doctor.
CASSANDRA: Impossible! I recognise that child.
Her face! Show me her face!
Closer, closer.
Face, face, face!
Can we go and visit New New York? So good they named it twice.
Well, I thought we might go there first.
Why? What is it?
Some sort of hospital.
Green moon on the side, that's the universal symbol for hospitals.
I got this. A message on the psychic paper.
Someone wants to see me.
Oh, and I thought we were just sightseeing.
Come on, then, let's go and buy some grapes.
Rose Tyler! I knew it!
That dirty blonde assassin.
She's coming here, mistress.
But this is beyond coincidence. This is destiny.
At last, I can be revenged on that little...
A bit rich coming from you.
I can't help it. I don't like hospitals. They give me the creeps.
(PA) The pleasure gardens will now take visitors carrying green or blue identification cards for the next 15 minutes.
Visitors are reminded that cuttings from the gardens are not permitted.
Very smart. Not exactly NHS.
No shop. I like the little shop.
I thought this far in the future, they'd have cured everything.
The human race moves on, but so do the viruses. It's an ongoing war.
(PA) Hope, harmony and health.
They're cats.
Now, don't stare.
Think what you look like to them. All pink and yellow.
That's where I'd put the shop, right there.
Ward 26, thanks.
Override controls.
Hold on, hold on!
Oh, too late. I'm going up.
All right, there's another lift.
Ward 26!
And watch out for the disinfectant.
Watch out for what?
The disinfectant!
The what?
The dis... Oh, you'll find out.
Ward 26, thanks.
(PA) Commence stage one disinfection.
Commence stage one disinfection.
The human child is clean.
Erm, I'm looking for ward 26.
This way, Rose Tyler.
Nice place.
No shop downstairs. I'd have a shop. Not a big one, just a shop.
So people can shop.
The hospital is a place of healing.
A shop does some people the world of good. Not me, other people.
The Sisters of Plenitude take a lifelong vow to help and to mend.
(GROANING) Excuse me!
Members of the public may only gaze upon the Duke of Manhattan with written permission from the Senate of New New York.
That's petrifold regression, right? I'm dying, sir.
A lifetime of charity and abstinence and it ends like this.
Any statements made by the Duke of Manhattan may not be made public without official clearance.
Frau Clovis...
I'm so weak.
Sister Jatt, a little privacy, please.
He'll be up and about in no time.
I doubt it.
Petrifold regression, he's turning to stone. There won't be a cure for a thousand years.
He might be up and about but only as a statue.
Have faith in the Sisterhood.
But is there no one here you recognise?
It's rather unusual to visit without knowing the patient.
No, I think I've found him.
Novice Hame, if I can leave this gentleman in your care.
Oh, I think my friend got lost. Rose Tyler. Could you ask at reception?
Certainly, sir.
I'm afraid the Face of Boe is asleep. That's all he tends to do these days.
Are you a friend, or...
We met just the once. On Platform One. What's wrong with him?
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.
The Face of Boe is dying.
Of what?
Old age. One thing we can't cure.
He's thousands of years old, some people say millions, although that's impossible.
Oh, I don’t know. I like impossible.
I'm here. I look a bit different, but it's me.
It's the Doctor.
(THE FACE OF BOE GROANING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) MAN: Look at me!
Isn't it wonderful?
Well, you never know what your life is going to be like, ever.
I'm bored with this drink. Anyway...
Oh, hello, darling. Oh! Now don't. Stop it Wait a minute, That's...
Peek-a-boo!
Don't you come anywhere near me, Cassandra.
Why? What do you think I'm going to do? Flap you to death?
Yeah, but what about Gollum?
Oh, that's just Chip. He's my pet.
I worship the mistress.
Moisturise me, moisturise me.
He's not even a proper life form. He's a force-grown clone.
I modelled him on my favourite pattern.
But he's so faithful.
Chip sees to my physical needs.
I hope that means food. How come you're still alive?
After you murdered me?
That was your own fault.
The brain of my mistress survived.
And her pretty blue eyes were salvaged from the bin.
What about the skin?
I saw it. You got ripped apart.
That piece of skin was taken from the front of my body.
This piece is the back.
Right, so you're talking out of your...
Ask not!
The mistress was lucky to survive. Chip secreted m'lady into the hospital.
~So they don't know you're here?
Chip steals medicine.
Helps m'lady. Soothes her.
Strokes her.
You can stop right there, Chip.
But I'm so alone, hidden down here.
The last human in existence.
Don't start that again.
They've called this planet New Earth.
A vegetable patch.
And there's millions of humans out there, millions of them.
Mutant stock.
They evolved, Cassandra, they just evolved. Like they should.
You stayed still, you got yourself all pickled and preserved, and what good did it do you?
I remember that night. Drinks for the Ambassador of Thrace.
That was the last time anyone told me I was beautiful.
After that, it all became such hard work.
You've got a knack for survival, I'll give you that.
But I've not been idle, Rose. Tucked away, underneath this hospital, I've been listening. The Sisters are hiding something.
What do you mean?
These cats have secrets, Hush. Let me whisper, come close.
You must be joking if you think I'm coming anywhere near you.
Chip! Activate the psycho-graft!
I can't move. Cassandra, let me go!
What are you doing?
The lady's moving on.
It's goodbye trampoline and hello blondie!
Mistress.
Moisturise me.
How bizarre. Arms.
Fingers!
Hair!
Let me see, let me see.
Oh, my God!
I'm a chav.
(PA) Hope, harmony and health.
Hope, harmony and health.
That's very kind. There's no need.
You're the one working. There's not much to do.
Just maintain his smoke.
And I suppose I'm company. I can hear him singing sometimes, in my mind.
Such ancient songs.
Am I the only visitor?
The rest of Boekind became extinct long ago.
He's the only one Left.
Legend says that the Face of Boe has watched the universe grow old.
There's all sorts of superstitions around him.
One story says that just before his death, the Face of Boe will impart his great secret.
That he will speak those words only to one like himself.
What does that mean?
It's just a story.
Tell me the rest.
It's said he'll talk to a wanderer. To the man without a home.
The lonely god.
Look at me. From class to brass.
Although...
Ooh.
Curves. Oh, baby!
It's like living inside a bouncy castle.
The mistress is beautiful.
Absolument.
Oh, but look.
Aw, the brain meat expired.
My old mistress has gone.
But safe and sound in here.
But what of the Rose child's mind?
Tucked away. I can just about access the surface memory. She's...
God, she's with the Doctor.
That man, he's the Doctor.
The same Doctor with a new face!
That hypocrite!
I must get the name of his surgeon.
I could do with a little work. Although...
nice rear bumper.
(PHONE RINGING) Oh! It seems to be ringing. Is it meant to ring?
A primitive communications device.
DOCTOR: Rose, where are you?
How does she speak?
Old Earth cockney.
Um...
Wotcha.
Where've you been?
How long does it take to get to ward 26?
I'm on my way, guv'nor.
I shall proceed up the apples and pears.
You'll never guess! I'm with the Face of Boe. Remember him?
Of course I do.
That big old... boat race.
I'd better go. See you in a minute.
(CHUCKLING) I didn't think I was going to make it.
It's that man again! He's my good luck charm.
Come in! Don't be shy.
Any friendship expressed by the Duke of Manhattan does not constitute a form of legal contract.
Winch me up!
Up! Look at me. No sign of infection.
Champagne, sir?
No, thanks.
You had petrifold regression, right?
"Had" being the operative word.
Past tense!
Completely cured.
But that's impossible.
Primitive species would accuse us of magic but it's merely the tender application of science.
How on earth did you cure him?
How on New Earth, you might say.
What's in that solution?
A simple remedy.
Then tell me what it is.
I'm sorry. Patient confidentiality.
I don't believe we've met. My name is Matron Casp.
I'm the Doctor.
I think you'll find that we are the doctors here.
Matron Casp, you're needed in intensive care.
If you would excuse me.
It's happened again. One of the patients is conscious.
Well, we can't have that.
This Doctor man is dangerous.
Dangerous and clever.
I might need a mind like his. The Sisterhood is up to something.
Remember that old Earth saying? "Never trust a nun...
"never trust a nurse and never trust a cat." Perfume?
It was having a perfectly normal blood-wash, then all of a sudden it started crying. It's this one.
CREATURE: Please.
Look at its eyes. So alive.
Help me.
Positively sparkling.
Please.
Where am I?
And speech.
How can it even have a vocabulary?
Sister Corvin has written a thesis on the migration of sentience.
She calls it 7he Echo of Life. It's well worth a read.
Help me.
I've seen enough, thank you.
If this happens again, we might have to review our brainstem policy.
And what should we do with the patient?
Standard procedure. Incinerate.
(SCREAMING) (PA) Ambient temperature stands at 14 degrees cohezic.
Repeat, 14 degrees cohezic.
This temperature is designed to promote healing and well-being.
There you are. Come and look at this patient.
Marconi's disease. Should take years to recover.
Two days. I've never seen anything like it.
They've invented a cell-washing cascade. It's amazing.
Their medical science is way advanced. And this one.
Pallidome pancrosis. Kills you in ten minutes, and he's fine.
I need to find a terminal. I've got to see how they do this.
‘Cause if they've got the best medicine in the world, then why is it such a secret?
I can't Adam and Eve it.
What... What's with the voice?
I don't know, just larking about. New Earth.
New me.
Well, I can talk. New new Doctor.
Mmm, aren't you just?
(STUTTERING) Terminal’s this way.
Yeah, still got it.
No, nothing odd. Surgery. Post-op.
Nanodentistry.
No sign of a shop. They should have a shop.
No, it's missing something else.
When I was downstairs, those nurse-cat-nuns were talking about intensive care, but where is it?
You're right. Well done.
Why would they hide a whole department?
It's got to be there somewhere. Search the subframe.
What if the subframe's locked?
Try the installation protocol.
Yeah. Course. Sorry.
(DOOR OPENING) Intensive care, Certainly looks intensive.
That's disgusting. What's wrong with him?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
What disease is that?
All of them.
Every single disease in the galaxy. They've been infected with everything.
What about us? Are we safe?
The air's sterile. Just don't touch them.
How many patients are there?
They're not patients.
But they're sick.
They were born sick.
They're meant to be sick. They exist to be sick.
Lab rats.
No wonder the Sisters have got a cure for everything.
They've built the ultimate research laboratory.
A human farm!
Why don't they just die?
Plague carriers. The last to go.
It's for the greater cause.
Novice Hame.
When you took your vows, did you agree to this?
The Sisterhood has sworn to help.
What, by killing?
But they're not real people.
They're specially grown. They have no proper existence.
What's the turnover?
A thousand a day? Thousand the next? Thousand the next? How many thousands?
For how many years? How many?
Mankind needed us.
They came to this planet with so many illnesses, we couldn't cope.
We did try. We tried everything.
We tried using clone meat and bio-cattle, but the results were too slow.
So the Sisterhood grew its own flesh.
That's all they are. Flesh.
These people are alive.
But think of those humans out there, healthy, and happy, because of us.
If they live because of this then life is worthless.
But who are you to decide that?
I'm the Doctor.
And if you don't like it, if you want to take it to a higher authority, there isn't one.
It stops with me.
Just to confirm...
none of the humans in the city actually know about this?
We thought it best not...
Hold on. I can understand the bodies, I can understand your vows, but one thing I can’t understand.
What have you done to Rose?
I don't know what you mean.
And I'm being very, very calm.
You want to be aware of that. Very, very calm.
And the only reason I'm being so very, very calm is that the brain is a delicate thing.
Whatever you've done to Rose's head, I want it reversed.
We haven't done anything.
I'm perfectly fine.
These people are dying and Rose would care.
All right, clever clogs. Smarty-pants.
Ladykiller.
What's happened to you?
I knew something was going on in this hospital but I needed this body and your mind to find it out.
Who are you?
The last human.
Cassandra?
Wake up and smell the perfume.
You've hurt him.
I don't understand. I'll have to fetch Matron.
You do that ‘cause I want to see her.
Now run along! Sound the alarm!
Matron, it's that man and the girl.
We heard the alarm.
Now, get back to work. Tend to your patients.
Let me out! Let me out!
Aren't you lucky there was a spare? Standing room only.
You've stolen Rose's body!
Over the years, I've thought of a thousand ways to kill you, Doctor.
And now that's exactly what I've got. One thousand diseases.
They pump the patients with a top-up every 10 minutes.
You've got about three minutes left.
Enjoy.
Just let Rose go, Cassandra. will As soon as I find someone younger and less common.
Then I'll junk her with the waste. Now hush-a-bye.
It's showtime.
Anything we can do to help?
Straight to the point, whiskers. I want money.
The Sisterhood is a charity, we don't give money. We only accept.
The humans across the water pay you a fortune, and that's exactly what I need.
A one-off payment, that's all I want.
Oh, and perhaps a yacht, in return for which I will tell the city nothing of your institutional murder.
Is that a deal?
I'm afraid not.
I'd really advise you to think about this.
Oh, there's no need. I have to decline.
I'll tell them. And you've no way of stopping me.
You're not exactly nuns with guns. You're not even armed.
Who needs arms when we have claws?
(SNARLING) Well, nice try. Chip, plan B!
(ALARM SOUNDING) What have you done?
Gave the system a shot of adrenalin, just to wake them up. See ya!
Don't touch them! Whatever you do, don't touch!
WOMAN: Save us.
I think we should withdraw.
We understood what you did to us.
As part of the machine, we know the machine.
Fascinating. It's actually constructing an argument.
And we will end it.
(ALL GROANING) Save us.
They're free.
By the goddess Santori!
The flesh is free!
(GROANING) Stop the pain.
(SCREAMING) ROSE: Oh, my God!
What the hell have you done?
It wasn't me.
One touch and you get every disease in the world.
And I want that body safe, Cassandra. We've got to go down.
But there's thousands of them.
DOCTOR: Down, down, go down!
Quarantine the building!
(PA) This building is under quarantine, Repeat, this building is under quarantine.
No one may leave the premises.
Repeat, no one may leave the premises.
DOCTOR: Keep going! Go down!
(WHISPERING) Help us. Save us.
(SCREAMING) Help me!
No, the lifts have closed down. There's a quarantine, nothing's moving.
This way!
Don't let them touch you!
Leave him! This is a clone thing. He's only got a half-life. Come on!
Mistress! I'm sorry, I can’t let her escape.
My mistress!
Excuse me, can we get some service?
(SCREAMING) We're trapped! What are we going to do?
Well, for starters, you're going to leave that body.
That psycho-graft is banned on every civilised planet.
You're compressing Rose to death.
But I've got nowhere to go.
My original skin's dead.
Not my problem. You can float as atoms in the air. Now get out.
Give her back to me.
You asked for it.
Blimey, my head.
Where did she go?
Oh my, this is... different.
~Cassandra?
Goodness me, I'm a man.
Yum. So many parts. And hardly used.
Oh! Ah! Two hearts!
Oh, baby, I'm beating out a samba.
Get out of him!
Ooh, he's slim.
And a little bit foxy.
You thought so, too. I've been inside your head.
You've been looking.
You like it.
What do we do? What would he do? The Doctor! What the hell would he do?
Ladder. We've got to get up.
Out of the way, blondie!
Please! Help us!
If you get out of the Doctor's body, he can think of something.
(MIMICKING ROSE) God, it was tedious inside your head. Hormone city.
But we're gonna die if... Ow!
Get off!
All our good work. All that healing.
The good name of the Sisterhood. You have destroyed everything!
~Go and play with a ball of string.
Everywhere, disease.
This is the human world. Sickness!
(SCREAMING) Move!
(PA) Maximum quarantine, Divert all shuttles.
Help us.
Now what do we do?
Use the sonic screwdriver.
You mean this thing?
Yes, I mean that thing!
But I don't know how! That Doctor's hidden away all his thoughts.
Cassandra, go back into me. The Doctor can open it.
Do it!
Hold on tight.
Oh, chav-tastic again.
Open it!
Not till you get out of her!
We need the Doctor.
I order you to leave her!
No matter how difficult the situation, there is no need to shout.
Cassandra, get out of him!
But if I go into you, he simply refuses. He's so rude.
I don't care, just do something!
Oh, I'm so going to regret this.
Oh, sweet Lord! I look disgusting.
Nice to have you back.
No, you don't.
That is your last warning, Cassandra.
Inside her head...
They're so alone.
They keep reaching out, just to hold us.
All their lives and they've never been touched.
(BANGING) We're safe, we're safe, we're safe! We're clean, we're clean! Look, look.
Show me your skin.
Look! Clean! Look!
If we'd been touched, we'd be dead.
How's it going up here? What's the status?
Nothing but silence from the other wards. I think we're the only ones left.
I've been trying to override the quarantine.
If I can trip a signal over to New New York, they can send a private executive squad.
You can’t do that. If they forced entry, they'd break quarantine.
I am not dying in here.
We can't let a single particle of disease get out.
There's 1 million people in that city, they'd all be at risk. Now turn that off.
Not if it gets me out.
All right, fine. So I have to stop you lot as well. Suits me.
Rose, Novice Hame, everyone! Excuse me, Your Grace.
Get me the intravenous solutions for every single disease! Move it!
How's that? Will that do?
I don't know. Will it do for what?
The lifts aren't working...
Not moving, different thing.
Here we go.
But you're not going to...
What do you think you're doing?
(MUMBLING) Come on.
Not in a million years.
I need another pair of hands. What do you think?
If you're so desperate to stay alive, why don't you live a little?
Seal the door!
(MOANING) Help.
No!
You're completely mad. I can see why she likes you.
Going down!
Well, that's one way to lose weight.
Now, listen. When I say so, take hold of that lever.
There's still a quarantine down there. We can't...
Hold that lever!
I'm cooking up a cocktail. I know a bit about medicine myself.
Now, that lever's gonna resist, but keep it in position.
Hold on to it with everything you've got.
What about you?
I've got an appointment. The Doctor is in.
I'm in here! Come on!
Don't tell them!
Pull that lever!
DOCTOR: Come and get me! Come on. I'm in here! Come on!
(PA) Commence stage one disinfection.
Come and get me. Come on!
Come on. Come on.
All they want to do is pass it on.
Pass it on!
Pass on what?
Pass on what?
Pass it on!
(HISSING) What did they pass on? Did you kill them? All of them?
No, that's your way of doing things.
I'm the Doctor and I cured them.
That's right. Hey! There we go, sweetheart.
Hey?
Go to him. Go. That's it. That's it.
It's a new subspecies, Cassandra. A brand-new form of life.
New humans. Look at them! Look!
Run by cats, kept in the dark, fed by tubes, but completely, completely alive!
You can't deny them ‘cause you helped create them.
The human race just keeps on going.
Keeps on changing. Life will out.
Ha!
MAN: This is the NNYPD. Please step away from the shuttles.
(PA) All staff will present themselves to the officers for immediate arrest.
I repeat. Immediate arrest.
All new life forms will be catalogued and taken into care.
All visitors to the hospital will be required to make a statement to the NNYPD.
The Face of Boe!
You were supposed to be dying.
There are better things to do today. Dying can wait.
Oh, I hate telepathy.
Just what I need, a head full of big-face.
Shh!
Thad grown tired with the universe, Doctor, but you have taught me to look at it anew.
There are legends, you know, saying that you're millions of years old.
Well, now, that would be impossible.
DOCTOR: Wouldn't it just?
I got the impression there was something you wanted to tell me.
A great secret.
So the legend says.
It can wait.
Oh, does it have to?
We shall meet again, Doctor, for the third time, for the last time, and the truth shall be told.
Until that day...
That is enigmatic.
That is... that is textbook enigmatic.
And now for you.
But everything's happy. Everything's fine. Can't you just leave me?
You've lived long enough.
Leave that body and end it, Cassandra.
I don't want to die.
No one does.
Help me. I can't.
Mistress...
Oh! You're alive!
I kept myself safe for you, mistress.
A body!
And not just that. A volunteer!
Don't you dare! He's got a life of his own.
But I worship the mistress.
I welcome her.
You can't, Cassandra. You...
Oh! You all right?
Okay?
Yeah.
Hello.
Hello. Welcome back.
Oh, sweet Lord! I'm a walking doodle.
You can't stay in there. I'm sorry, Cassandra, but that's not fair.
I can take you to the city. They can build you a skin-tank, and you can stand trial for what you've done.
Well, that would be rather dramatic.
Possibly my finest hour, and certainly my finest hat.
But I'm afraid we don't have time.
Poor little Chip, he's only a half-life.
And he's been through so much. His heart is racing so.
He's failing. I don't think he's going to last...
You all right?
I'm fine, I'm dying.
But that's fine.
I can take you to the city.
No, you won't.
Everything's new on this planet.
There's no place for Chip and me anymore.
You were right, Doctor.
It's time to die.
And that's good.
Come on, there's one last thing I can do.
(WHOOSHING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) CASSANDRA: Oh, no don't!
That's simply not true.
And believe me, it was so dismal.
And the mosquitoes, I can't tell you. They were...
Thank you.
Just go. And don't look back.
Good luck.
And if you actually see them, you're shot! But don't quote me on that.
A bientot.
Excuse me, the Lady Cassandra?
I'm sorry, I don't need anything right now. I'm fine, thank you.
No, I just wanted to say... you look beautiful.
Well. That's very kind, you strange little thing.
Thank you very much.
I mean it.
You look...
so beautiful.
Thank you.
Oh, my Lord. Are you all right? What is it? What's wrong?
Someone get some help!
Call a medic or something, quickly.
I don't know, he just came up to me.
Don't even know his name.
He just collapsed. I think he's dying. Someone do something!
I've got you, sweetheart. It's all right. There you are.
There you are. I've got you.
It'll be alright. There, there.
You poor little thing.
 @@@@@@
@@@@@@
Come now, Father, you should know better.
You're not welcome here, and especially not today.
I've got no time to start old arguments.
We want only one thing.
And what would that be?
This house.
You want the house?
We will take the house, Would you like my wife while you're at it?
If you won't stand aside, then we'll take it by force.
And by what power? The hand of God?
No, the fist of man.
(MAN GRUNTING) (WOMEN SCREAMING) In the name of Heaven.
My Lady?
What's in there? What is it? What's under the canvas?
Father, answer me. What's in there?
May God forgive me.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) What do you think of this? Will it do? “The late 1970s?
You'd be better off in a bin bag. Hold on, listen to this.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Tan Dury and The Blockheads. Number one in 1979.
You're a punk!
# It's good to be a lunatic # That's what you are, a big old punk with a bit of rockabilly thrown in.
Do you want to go and see him?
How do you mean, in concert?
What else is the Tardis for?
I can take you to the Battle of Trafalgar, the First Antigravity Olympics, Caesar crossing the Rubicon or Ian Dury at the Top Rank, Sheffield, England, Earth, 21st November 1979, what do you think?
~Sheffield it is!
Hold on tight.
(HIT ME WITH YOUR RHYTHM STICK BY TAN DURY AND THE BLOCKHEADS PLAYING) Landing!
1979! Hell of a year!
China invades Vietnam. The Muppet Movie, love that film.
Margaret Thatcher. Skylab falls to Earth with a little help from me.
Nearly took off my thumb, and I like my thumb.
I need my thumb. I'm very attached to... my thumb.
1879, Same difference.
You will explain your presence, and the nakedness of this girl.
Are we in Scotland?
How can you be ignorant of that?
(SCOTTISH ACCENT) I'm dazed and confused.
I've been chasing this wee naked child over hill and over dale.
Isn't that right, you timorous beastie?
(SCOTTISH ACCENT) Och, aye. I've been "oot" and "aboot." No, don't do that.
Hoots, mon?
No, really don't. Really.
Will you identify yourself, sir?
I'm Doctor James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory.
I have my credentials, if I may?
As you can see, a doctorate from the University of Edinburgh.
I trained under Doctor Bell himself.
WOMAN: Let them approach.
I don't think that's wise, ma'am.
Let them approach.
You will approach the carriage, and show all due deference.
Rose, might I introduce Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Empress of India and Defender of the Faith.
Rose Tyler, ma’am.
And my apologies for being so naked.
I've had five daughters. It's nothing to me.
But you, Doctor, show me these credentials.
Why didn't you say so immediately?
It states clearly here that you have been appointed by the Lord Provost as my protector.
Does it? Yes, it does. Good. Good.
Erm, then let me ask, why is Your Majesty travelling by road when there's a train all the way to Aberdeen?
A tree on the line.
An accident?
I am the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
Everything around me tends to be planned.
An assassination attempt?
What, seriously? There's people out to kill you?
I'm quite used to staring down the barrel of a gun.
Sir Robert MacLeish lives but 10 miles hence.
We've sent word ahead.
He'll shelter us for tonight, then we can reach Balmoral tomorrow.
This Doctor and his timorous beastie will come with us.
Yes, ma'am.
We'd better get moving. It's almost nightfall.
Indeed, and there are stories of wolves in these parts.
Fanciful tales, intended to scare the children, but good for the blood, I think. Drive on.
ROSE: It's funny, though, ‘cause you say assassination, and you just think of Kennedy and stuff, not her.
1879? She's had, oh, six attempts on her life.
And I'll tell you something else.
We just met Queen Victoria.
I know!
What a laugh!
She was just sitting there!
Like a stamp.
I want her to say, "We are not amused.” I bet you 5 quid I can make her say it.
Well, if I gambled on that, it would be an abuse of my privilege as a traveller in time.
10 quid.
Done.
I can't do this. It's treason.
Then your wife will suffer the consequences.
Believe me, Sir Robert, she will be devoured.
Your Majesty.
Sir Robert.
My apologies for the emergency. And how is Lady Isobel?
She's indisposed, I'm afraid.
She's gone to Edinburgh for the season, and she's taken the cook with her, the kitchens are barely stocked.
I wouldn't blame Your Majesty if you wanted to ride on.
Not at all. I've had quite enough carriage exercise, and this is charming, if rustic.
It's my first visit to this house.
My late husband spoke of it often, the Torchwood Estate.
Now, shall we go inside? And please excuse the naked girl.
Sorry!
She's a feral child.
I bought her for sixpence in old London town.
It was her or the Elephant Man, so...
Thinks he's funny, but I'm so not amused. What do you think, ma'am?
It hardly matters. Shall we proceed?
So close, Mackeson and Ramsay, you will escort the property. Hurry up.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
So what's in there, then?
Property of the Crown. You will dismiss any further thoughts, sir.
The rest of you, go to the rear of the house. Assume the designated positions.
You heard the orders, positions. Sir.
SOLDIER: You two, come with me...
(SHUSHING) Guard it with your life.
This, I take it, is the famous endeavour.
All my father's work. Built by hand in his final years.
It became something of an obsession. He spent his money on this, rather than caring for the house or himself.
I wish I'd met him. I like him.
That thing's beautiful, can I...
Help yourself.
What did he model it on?
I know nothing about it.
To be honest, most of us thought him a little, shall we say, eccentric.
I wish now I'd spent more time with him and listened to his stories.
It's a bit rubbish.
How many prisms has it got? Way too many!
The magnification's gone right over the top. That's a stupid kind of...
Am I being rude again?
Yep!
But it's pretty! It's very pretty.
And the imagination of it should be applauded.
Hmm. I thought you might disapprove, Your Majesty.
Stargazing. Isn't that a bit fanciful?
You could easily not be amused, or something. No?
This device surveys the infinite work of God.
What could be finer?
Sir Robert's father was an example to us all, a polymath, steeped in astronomy and the sciences, yet equally well-versed in folklore and fairytales.
Stars and magic. I like him more and more.
Oh, my late husband enjoyed his company.
Prince Albert himself was acquainted with many rural superstitions, coming as he did from Saxe-Coburg.
That's Bavaria.
When Albert was told about your local wolf, he was transported.
So what's this wolf, then?
It's just a story. Then tell it.
It's said that...
Excuse me, sir.
Perhaps Her Majesty's party could repair to their rooms.
It's almost dark.
Of course. Yes, of course.
And then supper.
And could we find some clothes for Miss Tyler?
I'm tired of nakedness.
It's not amusing, is it?
Sir Robert, your wife must have left some clothes. See to it.
We shall dine at 7:00, and talk some more of this wolf.
After all, there is a full moon tonight.
So there is, ma'am.
(LAUGHING) (SCREAMS) They came through the house in silence.
They took the steward and the master, and my lady.
Listen, I've got a friend.
He's called the Doctor. He'll know what to do.
You've got to come with me.
Oh, but I can't, Miss.
What's your name? Flora.
Flora, we'll be safe.
There's more people arrived downstairs, soldiers and everything.
They can help us. I promise.
Come on. Okay? Come on.
Oh, Miss, I did warn you.
He's not dead, I don't think. He must be drugged or something.
(MUFFLED SCREAMING) Your companion begs an apology, Doctor. Her clothing has somewhat delayed her.
Oh, that's all right. Save her a wee bit of ham.
The feral child could probably eat it raw.
(LAUGHING) Very wise, ma'am. Very witty. Slightly witty, perhaps.
I know you rarely get the chance to dine with me, Captain, but don’t get too excited.
I shall contain my wit in case I do you further injury.
Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.
Besides, we're all waiting on Sir Robert. Come, sir.
You promised us a tale of nightmares.
VICTORIA: Indeed.
Since my husband's death, I find myself with more of a taste for supernatural fiction.
You must miss him.
Very much.
Oh, completely.
And that's the charm of a ghost story, isn't it?
Not the scares and chills, that's just for children, but the hope of some contact with the great beyond.
We all want some message from that place.
It's the Creator's greatest mystery that we're allowed no such consolation.
The dead stay silent, and we must wait.
Come, begin your tale, Sir Robert. There's a chill in the air.
The wind is howling through the eaves. Tell us of monsters.
Don't make a sound.
They said if we scream or shout, then he will slaughter us.
But he's in a cage. He's a prisoner. He's the same as us.
He's nothing like us. That creature is not mortal.
The story goes back 300 years.
Every full moon, the howling rings through the valley.
Next morning, livestock is found ripped apart and devoured.
Oh, tales like this just disguise the work of thieves.
Steal the sheep and blame a wolf, simple as that.
ROBERT: But sometimes a child goes missing.
Once in a generation, a boy will vanish from his homestead.
ISOBEL: Don't, child.
Who are you?
Don't enrage him.
Where are you from? You're not from Earth.
What planet are you from?
Oh... intelligence.
Where were you born?
This body?
Ten miles away.
A weakling, heartsick boy, stolen away at night by the Brethren for my cultivation.
I carved out his soul and sat in his heart.
Are there descriptions of the creature?
Oh, yes, Doctor.
Drawings and wood carvings.
And it's not merely a wolf, it's more than that.
This is a man who becomes an animal.
A werewolf?
ROSE: All right, so the body's human.
What about you, the thing inside?
So far from home.
If you want to get back home, we can help.
Why would I leave this place?
A world of industry, of workforce and warfare, I could turn it to such purpose.
How would you do that?
I would migrate to the Holy Monarch.
You mean Queen Victoria?
With one bite, I would pass into her blood.
And then it begins, the Empire of the Wolf.
So many questions.
Look! Inside your eyes. You've seen it, too.
Seen what?
The wolf. There is something of the wolf about you.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, you burn like the sun, but all I require is the moon.
My father didn't treat it as a story. He said it was fact.
He even claimed to have communed with the beast, to have learned its purpose.
I should have listened.
His work was hindered. He made enemies.
There's a monastery in the Glen of St Catherine.
The Brethren opposed my father's investigations.
Perhaps they thought his work ungodly.
That's what I thought, but now I wonder.
(FATHER CHANTING IN LATIN) What if they had a different reason for wanting the story kept quiet?
What if they turned from God and worshipped the wolf?
And what if they were with us right now?
Moonlight.
All of you, stop looking at him.
Flora, don't look, listen to me. Grab hold of the chain and pull!
Come on, with me! Pull!
I said pull! Stop your whining and listen to me! All of yous!
And that means you, your Ladyship. Now, come on! Pull!
What is the meaning of this?
Explain yourself, sir.
I'm sorry, Your Majesty, they've got my wife.
Rose, where's Rose? Where is she?
(FATHER CHANTING IN LATIN) Sir Robert, come on!
. three, pull!
One, two, three, pull!
Tell me, sir. I demand to know your intention.
(FATHER CHANTING IN LATIN) What is it that you want?
The throne.
(GROANING) ROSE: ... two, three, pull!
One, two, three, pull!
Where the hell have you been?
Oh, that's beautiful.
Isobel!
Get out, all of you! Come on! Out! Out! Out!
I take it, sir, that you halted my train to bring me here.
We've waited so long for one of your journeys to coincide with the moon.
Then you have waited in vain.
After six attempts on my life, I am hardly unprepared.
Oh, I don't think so, woman.
The correct form of address is "Your Majesty".
Guns.
I need five.
Lady Isobel, take the girls! Get them out through the kitchen.
Jackson, at arms...
I can't leave you. What will you do?
I must defend Her Majesty. Now, don't think of me, just go.
All of you at my side! Come on!
Could be any form of light-modulating species triggered by specific wavelengths. Did it say what it wanted?
The Queen, the crown, the throne, you name it.
(LOUD CRASHING) (WEREWOLF GROWLING) Fire! Fire!
It won't open. They've sealed us in.
Oh, my lady, look.
They'll never let us out.
They mean for us to die.
Don't say that, Flora!
Allright, you men, we should retreat upstairs. Come with me.
I'll not retreat. The battle's done.
There's no creature on God's earth could survive such an assault.
I'm telling you, come upstairs!
And I'm telling you, sir, I will sleep well tonight with that thing's hide upon my wall.
It must have crawled away to die.
(MAN SCREAMING) There's nothing we can do!
(GROWLING) No!
(GUNS FIRING) (MAN SHOUTING) Did they kill it?
Come close, (GROWLING) (FOOTSTEPS RETREATING) Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
Sir Robert, what's happening?
I heard such terrible noises, Your Majesty, we've got to get out.
But what of Father Angelo, is he still here?
Captain Reynolds disposed of him.
The front door's no good. It's been boarded shut.
Pardon me, Your Majesty, you'll have to leg it out of a window.
Excuse my manners, ma'am, but I shall go first, the better to assist Her Majesty's egress.
A noble sentiment, my Sir Walter Raleigh.
Yeah, any chance you could hurry up?
I reckon the monky-boys want us to stay inside.
Do they know who I am?
Yeah, that's why they want you.
The wolf's lined you up for a biting.
Now, stop this talk. There can't be an actual wolf.
(HOWLING) (BANGING AT DOOR) What do we do?
We run.
Is that it?
You got any silver bullets?
Not on me, no.
There we are, then. We run.
Your Majesty, as a doctor, I recommend a vigorous jog, good for the health.
(WOLF SNARLING) Come on. Come on.
(YELPING) I'll take this position and hold it. You keep moving, for God's sake.
Your Majesty, I went to look for the property and it was taken.
The chest was empty.
[have it. It's safe.
Then remove yourself, ma’am.
Doctor, you stand as Her Majesty's protector.
And you, Sir Robert. You're a traitor to the Crown.
Bullets can't stop it.
They'll buy you time. Now, run!
(CAPTAIN REYNOLDS SCREAMING) DOCTOR: Rose!
Barricade the door.
Wait a minute. Shh. Wait, wait, wait. Shh.
(HOWLING) It stopped.
It's gone.
Listen.
(WOLF SNARLING) (PAWS STOMPING) (WHISPERING) Is this the only door?
Yes, No!
(SNARLING) ROSE: Shh!
(WOOD CREAKING) (PANTING) (SNARLING) (STEPS RETREATING) I don't understand. What's stopping it?
Something inside this room.
What is it? Why can't it get in?
I tell you what, though.
What?
Werewolf.
I know!
You all right?
I'm okay, yeah.
I'm s 0 Ir, ,m a a 
It's all my fault.
I should have sent you away.
I tried to suggest something was wrong. I thought you might notice.
Did you think there was nothing strange about my household staff?
Well, they were bald, athletic.
Your wife's away, I just thought you were happy.
I'll tell you what though, ma’am, I bet you're not amused now.
Do you think this funny?
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.
What, exactly, I pray, tell me, someone, please, what exactly is that creature?
You'd call it a werewolf, but technically it's more of a lupine-wavelength haemovariform.
And should I trust you, sir? You, who change your voice so easily?
What happened to your accent?
Oh, right, sorry, that... T'll not have it.
No, sir. Not you, not that thing, none of it.
This is not my world.
Mistletoe.
They're all garlanded in mistletoe and the wolf doesn't attack them.
Who brought this into the kitchen?
Must have been the Brethren.
Gather it up, quickly. Every last scrap. Quick, now!
Mistletoe.
Sir Robert, did your father put that there?
I don't know. I suppose.
And on the other door, too.
Though a carving wouldn't be enough.
I wonder.
Viscum album, the oil of the mistletoe.
It's been worked into the wood like a varnish.
How clever was your dad? I love him!
Powerful stuff, mistletoe, bursting with lectins and viscotoxins.
And the wolf's allergic to it?
Or it thinks it is.
The monky-monk-monks need a way of controlling the wolf, maybe they trained it to react against certain things.
Nevertheless, that creature won't give up, Doctor, and we still don't possess an actual weapon.
Oh, your father got all the brains, didn't he?
Being rude again.
Good, I meant that one.
You want weapons? We're in a library. Books!
Best weapons in the world.
This room is the greatest arsenal we could have, Arm yourself.
There's no sound of the wolf, my lady, perhaps it's gone.
And perhaps it's toying with us.
But my husband's up there, and if there's any chance he's still alive, then, by God, I'll assist him.
Look up biology and zoology.
There might be something on wolves.
DOCTOR: What about this?
A whole book on mistletoe.
ROBERT: "The application of gunpowder...” If we could build some form of explosive.
Hmm, that's the sort of thing.
Ohhh.
Look what your old dad found. Something fell to Earth.
A spaceship?
Shooting star.
"In the year of our Lord 1540, under the reign of King James V, “an almighty fire did burn in the pit.” That's the Glen of Saint Catherine, just by the monastery.
But that's over 300 years ago. What's it been waiting for?
Maybe just a single cell survived. Adapting slowly down the generations, it survived through the humans, host after host after host.
But why does it want the throne?
That's what it wants, it said so. The Empire of the Wolf.
Imagine it. The Victorian Age accelerated.
Starships and missiles fuelled by coal and driven by steam, leaving history devastated in its wake.
~Sir Robert. If I am to die here...
Don't say that, Your Majesty.
I would destroy myself rather than let that creature infect me, but that's no matter.
Task only that you find some place of safekeeping for something far older and more precious than myself.
Hardly the time to worry about your valuables.
Thank you for your opinion, but there is nothing more valuable than this.
ROBERT: Oh, Your Majesty.
Is that the Koh-i-noor?
Oh, yes.
The greatest diamond in the world.
Given to me as the spoils of war.
Perhaps its legend is now coming true.
It is said that whoever owns it must surely die.
Well, that's true of anything, if you wait long enough. Can I?
That is so beautiful.
How much is that worth?
They say, the wages of the entire planet for a whole week.
Good job my mum's not here, she'd be fighting the wolf off with her bare hands for that thing.
And she'd win.
Where is the wolf?
I don’t trust this silence.
Why do you travel with it?
My annual pilgrimage.
I'm taking it to Hellier and Carew, the Royal Jewellers at Hazlehead.
The stone needs recutting.
But it's perfect.
My late husband never thought so.
Now, there's a fact.
Prince Albert kept on having the Koh-i-noor cut down.
It used to be 40% bigger than this, but he was never happy.
Kept on cutting and cutting.
He always said the shine was not quite right, but he died with it still unfinished.
Unfinished.
Oh, yes!
There's a lot of unfinished business in this house.
His father's research and your husband, ma'am.
He came here and he sought the perfect diamond.
Hold on, oh, hold on.
All these separate things, they're not separate at all, they're connected.
Oh, my head, my head!
What if this house... It's a trap for you. Is that right, ma‘am?
Obviously.
At least, that's what the wolf intended, but what if there's a trap inside the trap?
Explain yourself, Doctor.
What if his father and your husband weren't just telling each other stories.
They dared to imagine all this was true, and they planned against it.
Laying the real trap not for you, but for the wolf.
That wolf, there.
DOCTOR: Out! Out! Out! Out!
DOCTOR: Your Majesty!
We've got to get to the observatory!
(ROSE SCREAMING) (WOLF BURNING) DOCTOR: Good shot! FLORA: It was mistletoe, Isobel.
ROBERT: Now get back downstairs.
Keep yourself safe.
My love. Now, go.
Girls, come with me.
Down the back stairs back to the kitchens, quickly.
Come on.
The observatory is this way.
No mistletoe on these doors, ‘cause your father wanted the wolf to get inside.
I just need time. Is there any way of barricading this?
Do your work, and I'll defend it.
If we could bind them shut with rope or something...
I said I'll find you time, sir. Now, get inside.
Good man.
Your Majesty, the diamond.
For what purpose?
The purpose it was designed for.
(WOLF GROWLING) Rose.
Lift it, come on.
Not the right time for stargazing.
Yes, it is.
(DOCTOR GROANING) (WOLF GROWLING) I committed treason for you, but now my wife will remember me with honour.
(ROBERT SCREAMING) (BANGING AT DOOR) lam the Defender of the Faith, and that Faith shall defend me.
You said this thing doesn't work.
It doesn't work as a telescope, ‘cause that's not what it is.
It's a light chamber. It magnifies the light, like a weapon.
We've just got to power it up.
With what? There's no electricity.
Moonlight. But the wolf needs moonlight. It's made by moonlight.
You're 70% water, you can still drown. Come on!
Come on!
Make it brighter. Let me go.
(HOWLING) Your Majesty?
Did it bite you?
No, it's... It's a cut, that's all.
If that thing bit you...
It was a splinter of wood when the door came apart. It's nothing.
Let me see.
It is nothing.
By the power invested in me by the Church and the State, I dub thee Sir Doctor of Tardis.
By the power invested in me by the Church and the State, I dub thee Dame Rose of the Powell Estate.
You may stand.
Many thanks, ma’am.
Thanks. They're never gonna believe this back home, Your Majesty, you said last night about receiving no message from the great beyond.
I think your husband cut that diamond to save your life.
He's protecting you even now, ma'am, from beyond the grave.
Indeed.
Then you may think on this also, that I am not amused.
Yes!
Not remotely amused.
And henceforth, I banish you.
I'm sorry?
I have rewarded you, Sir Doctor, and now you are exiled from this Empire, never to return.
I don't know what you are, the two of you, or where you're from, but I know that you consort with stars and magic, and think it fun.
But your world is steeped in terror and blasphemy and death, and I will not allow it.
You will leave these shores, and you will reflect, I hope, on how you came to stray so far from all that is good, and how much longer you may survive this terrible life.
Now leave my world, and never return.
Whoa!
Cheers!
Walk on.
No, but the funny thing is, Queen Victoria actually did suffer a mutation of the blood.
It's historical record. She was haemophiliac.
They used to call it the Royal Disease, but it's always been a mystery because she didn’t inherit it.
Her mum didn't have it. Her dad didn't have it.
It came from nowhere.
What, and you're saying that’s a wolf bite?
Well, maybe haemophilia is just a Victorian euphemism.
For werewolf?
Could be.
Queen Victoria's a werewolf?
Could be.
And her children had the Royal Disease. Maybe she gave them a quick nip.
~So the Royal Family are werewolves?
Well, maybe not yet.
I mean, a single wolf cell could take 100 years to mature.
Might be ready by, oh, early 21st century.
No, that's just ridiculous.
Mind you, Princess Anne. T'll say no more.
And if you think about it, they're very private.
They plan everything in advance.
They could schedule themselves around the moon. We'd never know.
And they like hunting. They love blood sports.
(DOCTOR LAUGHING) Oh, my God! They're werewolves!
(BOTH LAUGHING) (BOTH HOWLING) (TARDIS WHOOSHING) What will you do? Will you stay here?
I don't think I could.
I'd sell it, or pull this place down.
Although we may not speak of these events in public, they will not be forgotten.
I promise you that.
Your husband's sacrifice, the ingenuity of his father, they will live on.
But how?
I saw, last night, that Great Britain has enemies beyond imagination, and we must defend our borders onall sides.
I propose an institute to investigate these strange happenings and to fight them.
I would call it Torchwood. The Torchwood Institute.
And if this Doctor should return, then he should beware, because Torchwood will be waiting.
 @@@@@@
@@@@@@
(HUMMING) What do you want?
The nurse sent me, sir.
I was in English and I got a headache.
Then don't bother me, go home. I can't.
Why? Is your mother at work?
live in Ambrose Hall, the children's home.
No parents? No one to miss you?
I see why the nurse sent you.
You poor child.
Poor, thin child.
Come inside.
It's nearly time for lunch.
(SCREECHING) (GIRL SCREAMING) (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) Good morning, class.
Are we sitting comfortably?
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) So... physics.
Physics, eh? Physics.
Physics.
Physics! Physics. Physics. Physics. Physics. Physics. Physics. Physics.
I hope one of you is getting all this down. Okay, let's see what you know.
Two identical strips of nylon are charged with static electricity and hung from a string so they can swing freely.
What would happen if they were brought near each other?
Yes, what's your name?
Milo.
Milo. Off you go.
They'd repel each other because they have the same charge.
Correct-amundo.
A word I have never used before and hopefully never will again.
Question two. I coil up a thin piece of nichrome wire and place it in a glass of water.
Then I turn on the electricity and measure to see if the water temperature is affected.
My question is this. How do I measure the electrical power going into the coil?
Someone else.
No? Okay. Milo, go for it.
Measure the current and PD using an ammeter and voltmeter.
Two to Milo! Right, Milo, tell me this.
True or false, the greater the damping on a system, the quicker it loses energy to its surroundings.
False.
What is non-coding DNA?
DNA that doesn't code for a protein.
65,983 times 5.
329,915.
How do you travel faster than light?
By harnessing a quantum tunnel with an FTL factor of 36.7 recurring.
Two days.
Sorry, could you just... There's a bit of gravy.
No, no, just there.
Two days we've been here.
Blame your boyfriend. He's the one who put us on to this.
He was right. Boy in class this morning, got knowledge way beyond planet Earth.
You eating those chips?
Yeah, they're a bit... different.
I think they're gorgeous. Wish I had school dinners like this.
It's very well behaved this place.
I thought they'd all be happy-slapping hoodies.
Happy-slapping hoodies with ASBOs.
Happy-slapping hoodies with ASBOs and ringtones. Eh?
Don't tell me I don't fit in.
You are not permitted to leave your station during a sitting.
I was just talking to this teacher.
Hello.
He doesn’t like the chips.
The menu has been specifically designed by the headmaster to improve concentration and performance.
Now get back to work.
See? This is me. Dinner lady.
I'll have the crumble. I'm so gonna kill you.
Melissa.
You'll be joining my class for the next period.
Milo's failed me so it's time we moved you up to the top class.
Kenny, not eating the chips?
I'm not allowed.
Luke, extra class. Now!
WOMAN: Careful, keep it steady. Don't spill a drop.
I said keep it steady. Careful.
That's it. Easy now. Steady.
(MOBILE RINGING) Right, second barrel, quickly now.
What have you got?
MICKEY: Confirmation.
I just got into army records. Three months ago, massive UFO activity.
They logged over 40 sightings. Lights in the sky, all of that.
Can't get any photos ‘cause then it gets all classified, secret.
Keeps locking me out.
Tell you what, though.
Three months ago, turns out all the kitchen staff were replaced.
And this lot are weird.
There's definitely something going on. I was right to call you home.
I thought maybe you called me home just... Well, just to call me home.
Do you think I'd just invent an emergency?
You could've done.
That's the last thing I'd do.
‘Cause every time I see you, an emergency just gets in the way.
(WOMAN SCREAMING) I've got to go.
Get her up, get her up!
Rose, what is it? What...
(SCREAMING) What you doing?
Calling an ambulance.
No need, she's quite all right.
(SCREAMING) It's fine. She does that.
I'd like you all to put your headphones on now, please.
Oh, children, the things you will see.
Mathematics. That's the cornerstone of our work here, But my improvements aren't confined to the classroom. No, no, no.
We've introduced a new policy here.
School dinners are absolutely free, but compulsory. Do try the chips.
Oh, I'd love to, thank you. And it's got to be said, the transformation you've brought about, it's amazing.
I mean, maybe you're working the children a little bit too hard now and then, but I think good results are more important than anything.
Exactly. You're a woman of vision, Miss Smith.
Oh, I can see everything, Mr Finch. Quite clearly.
Yesterday I had a 12-year-old girl give me the exact height of the walls of Troy in cubits.
And it's ever since the new headmaster arrived?
Finch arrived three months ago, next day half the staff got flu.
Finch replaced them with that lot.
Except for the teacher you replaced, and that was just plain weird, her winning the lottery like that.
How's that weird?
She never played.
Said the ticket was posted through her door at midnight.
Hmm?
The world is very strange.
FINCH: Excuse me, colleagues. A moment of your time.
May I introduce Miss Sarah Jane Smith. Miss Smith is a journalist who's writing a profile about me for The Sunday Times.
I thought it might be useful for her to get a view from the trenches, so to speak.
Don't spare my blushes.
Hello.
Oh, I should think so.
And you are?
Mmm? Uh, Smith. John Smith.
John Smith?
I used to have a friend who sometimes went by that name.
Well, it's a very common name.
He was a very uncommon man.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you!
Yes. Very nice. More than nice. Brilliant.
So, have you worked here long?
No, it's only my second day.
Oh, you're new, then? So what do you think of the school?
I mean, this new curriculum, so many children getting ill. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
You don't sound like someone just doing a profile.
Well, no harm in a little investigation while I'm here.
No, good for you. Good for you.
Oh, good for you, Sarah Jane Smith.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (GROWLING) (CRUNCHING) (SCREECHING) This isn't your classroom, Kenny. Now run along.
(DOGS BARKING) ROSE: Oh! It's weird seeing school at night.
It just feels wrong.
When I was a kid, I used to think all the teachers slept in school.
All right, team... Oh, I hate people who say “team”.
Uh, gang.
Erm...
comrades.
Anyway, Rose, go to the kitchen, get a sample of that oil.
Mickey, the new staff are all maths teachers. Check out the maths department.
I'm gonna look in Finch's office. Meet back here in 10 minutes.
You gonna be all right?
(SCOFFING) Me? Please.
Infiltration and investigation? I'm an expert at this.
Where's the maths department?
Down there, turn left, through the fire doors, on the right.
Thank you.
(SCREECHING) (THUDDING) (SCREECHING) Hello, Sarah Jane.
It's you.
Doctor.
Oh, my God. It's you, isn’t it?
You've regenerated.
Yeah.
Half a dozen times since we last met.
You look...
incredible.
So do you.
I got old.
What are you doing here?
Well, UFO sighting, school gets record results. I couldn't resist.
What about you?
The same, I thought you'd died.
I waited for you, you didn't come back and I thought you must have died.
I lived. Everyone else died.
What do you mean?
Everyone died, Sarah.
I can't believe it's you.
(PIERCING SCREAM) Okay, now I can.
Did you hear that?
Who's she?
Rose, Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane, Rose.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
You can tell you're getting older, your assistants are getting younger.
I'm not his assistant.
No?
Get you, tiger.
Sorry. Sorry, it was only me.
You told me to investigate so I started looking through these cupboards and all these fell out on me.
Oh, my God, they're rats.
Dozens of rats. Vacuum-packed rats!
And you decided to scream?
It took me by surprise.
Like a little girl.
It was dark! I was covered in rats!
Nine, maybe ten years old. I'm seeing pigtails, frilly skirt.
ROSE: Hello, can we focus?
Has anyone noticed anything strange about this?
Rats in school?
Well, obviously, they use them in biology lessons, they dissect them.
Or maybe you haven't reached that bit yet. How old are you?
Excuse me, no one dissects rats in school anymore.
They haven't done that for years. Where are you from, the Dark Ages?
Anyway! Moving on...
Everything started when Mr Finch arrived. We should go and check his office.
I don't mean to be rude or anything, but who exactly are you?
Sarah Jane Smith. I used to travel with the Doctor.
Oh! Well, he's never mentioned you.
Oh, I must've done. Sarah Jane. I mention her all the time.
Hold on, sorry... never.
What, not even once? He didn't mention me even once?
Oh, mate. The missus and the ex. Welcome to every man's worst nightmare.
DOCTOR: Maybe those rats were food. ROSE: Food for what?
Rose.
You know how you used to think all the teachers slept in the school?
Well, they do.
MICKEY: No way!
(SCREECHES) I am not going back in there. No way!
Those were the teachers?
When Finch arrived, he brought with him seven new teachers, four dinner ladies and a nurse, 13. Thirteen big bat people. Come on.
You've got to be kidding.
I need the Tardis.
I've got to analyse that oil from the kitchen.
I might be able to help you there. I've got something to show you.
kg!
Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith, allow me to introduce K9.
Well, K9 Mark 3 to be precise.
Why does he look so... disco?
Oi! Listen, in the year 5,000 this was cutting edge.
What's happened to him?
One day, just... Nothing.
Didn't you try and get him repaired?
It's not like getting parts for a Mini Metro.
Besides, the technology inside him could rewrite human science.
I couldn't show him to anyone.
Ooh, what's the nasty lady done to you, eh?
ROSE: Look, no offence, but can you two just stop petting for a minute?
Never mind the tin dog, we're busy.
(SCREECHING) You see, what's impressive is that it's been nearly an hour since we met her and I still haven't said "I told you so”.
I'm not listening to this.
Though I have prepared a little “I was right" dance that I can show you later.
Two quid, love.
All this time you've been giving it "he's different", but the truth is, he's just like any other bloke.
You don’t know what you're talking about.
Maybe not.
But if I were you, I'd go easy on the chips.
FINCH: Come to me.
Come to me.
I thought of you on Christmas Day, this Christmas just gone.
Great big spaceship overhead, I thought, “Oh, yeah! Bet he's up there." Right on top of it, yeah.
And Rose?
She was there, too.
Did I do something wrong? ‘Cause you never came back for me.
You just dumped me.
I told you, I was called back home and in those days humans weren't allowed.
I waited for you.
I missed you.
Oh, you didn't need me.
You were getting on with your life.
You were my life.
You know what the most difficult thing was?
Coping with what happens next. You know, with what doesn't happen next.
You took me to the furthest reaches of the galaxy, you showed me supernovas, intergalactic battles, and then you just dropped me back on Earth, How could anything compare to that?
All those things you saw, you want me to apologise for that?
No, but... we get a taste of that splendour and then we have to go back.
But look at you, you're investigating.
You found that school. You're doing what we always did.
You could have come back.
I couldn't.
Why not?
It wasn't Croydon.
Where you dropped me off, it wasn't Croydon.
Where was it?
Aberdeen.
Right. That's next to Croydon, isn’t it?
(K9 WHIRRING) Oh, hey! Now we're in business!
Master?
He recognises me!
Affirmative.
Rose, give us the oil.
I wouldn't touch it, though. That dinner lady got all scorched.
I'm no dinner lady. And I don't often say that.
Here we go. Come on, boy, here we go.
(STUTTERING) Off extract...
analysing.
Listen to him, man! That's a voice.
Careful. That's my dog.
Confirmation of analysis.
Substance is Krillitane oil.
They're Krillitanes.
Is that bad? Very.
Think how bad things could possibly be and add another suitcase full of bad.
And what are Krillitanes?
They're a composite race.
Just like your culture is a mixture of traditions from all sorts of countries, people you've invaded or been invaded by, you've got bits of Viking, bits of France, bits of whatever.
The Krillitanes are the same, an amalgam of the races they've conquered.
But they take physical aspects as well.
They cherry-pick the best bits from the people they destroy.
That's why I didn't recognise them.
The last time I saw Krillitanes they looked just like us, except they had really long necks.
What are they doing here?
It's the children.
They're doing something to the children.
So, what's the deal with the tin dog?
The Doctor likes travelling with an entourage.
Sometimes they're humans, sometimes they're aliens, and sometimes they're tin dogs.
What about you? Where do you fit in the picture?
Me? I'm their man in Havana, I'm their technical support, I'm...
Oh, my God. I'm the tin dog.
On my command.
ROSE: How many of us have there been travelling with you?
Does it matter?
Yeah, it does, if I'm just the latest in a long line.
As opposed to what?
I thought you and me were...
I obviously got it wrong.
I've been to the year 5 billion, right, but this...
Now, this is really seeing the future. You just leave us behind.
Is that what you're gonna do to me?
No. Not to you.
But Sarah Jane. You were that close to her once, and now, you never even mention her.
Why not?
I don't age.
I regenerate.
But humans decay. You wither and you die.
Imagine watching that happen to someone that you...
What, Doctor?
You can spend the rest of your life with me...
but I can't spend the rest of mine with you.
I have to live on. Alone.
That's the curse of the Time Lords, Time Lord.
(SCREECHING) Was that a Krillitane?
It didn't even touch you, it just flew off. What did it do that for?
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING) Rose and Sarah, you go to the maths room. Crack open those computers.
I need to see the hardware inside. Here, you might need this.
Mickey, surveillance. I want you outside.
Just stand outside?
Here, take these. You can keep K9 company.
Don't forget to leave the window open a crack.
He's metal.
I didn't mean for him.
What are you gonna do?
It's time I had a word with Mr Finch.
Who are you?
My name is Brother Lassar. And you?
The Doctor.
Since when did Krillitanes have wings?
It's been our form for nearly 10 generations now.
Our ancestors invaded Bessan.
The people there had some rather lovely wings.
They made a million widows in one day, just imagine.
And now your shape’s human.
A personal favourite, that's all.
And the others?
My brothers remain bat form.
What you see is a simple morphic illusion.
Scratch the surface and the true Krillitane lies beneath.
And what of the Time Lords?
I always thought of you as such a pompous race.
Ancient, dusty senators.
So frightened of change, and chaos.
And, of course, they're all but extinct.
Only you. The last.
This plan of yours, what is it?
You don't know?
That's why I'm asking.
Well, show me how clever you are. Work it out.
If I don’t like it, then it will stop.
Fascinating.
Your people were peaceful to the point of indolence.
You seem to be something new.
Would you declare war on us, Doctor?
I'm so old now.
I used to have so much mercy.
You get one warning, That was it.
But we're not even enemies. Soon, you will embrace us.
The next time we meet, you will join with me.
I promise you.
Surveillance! You ask me, it's just another way of saying, "Go sit at the back of the class with the safety scissors and glitter.” (SIGHING) That'll be me talking to a metal dog, then.
Oh!
It's not working.
Give it to me.
Used to work first time in my day.
Well, things were a lot simpler back then.
Rose, can I give you a bit of advice?
I've got a feeling you're about to.
I know how intense a relationship with the Doctor can be and I don't want you to feel I'm intruding...
I don't feel threatened by you if that's what you mean.
Right. Good. Because I'm not interested in picking up where we left off.
No?
With the big sad eyes and the robot dog, what else were you doing last night?
I was just saying how hard it was adjusting to life back on Earth.
The thing is, when you two met, they'd only just got rid of rationing.
No wonder all that space stuff was a bit too much for you.
Thad no problem with space stuff. I saw things you wouldn't believe.
Try me.
Mummies. I've met ghosts.
Robots. Lots of robots.
Slitheen, in Downing Street.
Daleks.
Met the Emperor.
Antimatter monsters!
Gas mask zombies!
Real living dinosaurs!
Real living werewolf!
The Loch Ness monster! Seriously?
Oh!
Listen to us.
It's like me and my mate Shareen, the only time we fell out was over a man.
And we're arguing over the Doctor.
With you, did he do that thing where he'd explain something at like 90 miles per hour, and you'd go, "What?" and he'd look at you like you'd just dribbled on your shirt?
All the time.
Does he still stroke bits of the Tardis?
Yeah! Yeah, he does! I'm like, "Do you two want to be alone?” How's it going?
What?
Listen, I need to find out what's programmed inside these.
What? Stop it.
Brothers, we must initiate the final phase.
Get the children inside and seal the school.
Our time has come, my brothers. Today we shall become gods.
(PA SYSTEM BUZZING) WOMAN: (ON PA SYSTEM) All pupils to class immediately.
And would all members of staff please congregate in the staff room?
Break time's finished early! Isn't that fantastic?
No, no, this classroom’s out of bounds. You've all got to go to the south hall.
Off you go, south hall!
What is it now, Mr Finch?
Slight change in the timetable. We're having an early lunch.
(SCREECHING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) I can't shift it.
I thought the sonic screwdriver could open anything.
Anything except a deadlock seal. There's got to be something inside here.
What are they teaching those kids?
Close the school.
(BELCHING) You wanted the programme. There it is.
Some sort of code, No.
No, they can't be.
They've taken them all.
What?
They've taken all the children!
Turn...
Come on, I need some help.
System restarting. All primary drives functioning.
You're working! Okay, no time to explain, we need to get inside the school.
Do you have, like, I don’t know, a lock-picking device?
We are in a car.
Maybe a drill attachment?
We are in a car.
Fat lot of good you are.
We are in a car.
Wait a second. We're in a car.
Get back!
The Skasas Paradigm.
They're trying to crack the Skasas Paradigm.
The Skasas what?
The god-maker. The universal theory.
Crack that equation and you've got control of the building blocks of the universe.
Time and space and matter, yours to control.
What, and the kids are like a giant computer?
Yes.
And their learning power is being accelerated by the oil.
That oil from the kitchens, it works as a conducting agent, makes the kids cleverer.
But that oil's on the chips. I've been eating them.
What's 59 times 35?
2065.
Oh, my God!
But why use children? Can't they use adults?
No, it's got to be children. The god-maker needs imagination to crack it.
They're not just using the children’s brains to break the code, they're using their souls.
Let the lesson begin.
Think of it, Doctor.
With the paradigm solved, reality becomes clay in our hands.
We can shape the universe and improve it.
Oh, yeah, the whole of creation with the face of Mr Finch.
Call me old-fashioned, I like things as they are.
You act like such a radical and yet all you want to do is preserve the old order.
Think of the changes that could be made if this power was used for good.
What, by someone like you?
No.
Someone like you.
The paradigm gives us power, but you could give us wisdom.
Become a god at my side.
Imagine what you could do. Think of the civilisations you could save.
Perganon, Ascinta, your own people, Doctor.
Standing tall.
The Time Lords... reborn.
Doctor, don't listen to him.
And you could be with him throughout eternity.
Young, fresh.
Never wither, never age, never die. Their lives are so fleeting.
So many goodbyes.
How lonely you must be, Doctor.
Join us.
I could save everyone. “Yes, I could stop the war.
No. The universe has to move forward.
Pain and loss, they define us as much as happiness or love.
Whether it's a world or a relationship.
Everything has its time. And everything ends.
Out!
Come on!
(SCREECHING) What is going on?
Are they my teachers?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
We need the Doctor alive. As for the others, you can feast.
(SCREECHING) SARAH: K9!
Suggest you engage running mode, mistress.
Come on!
DOCTOR: K9, hold them back!
Affirmative, master.
Maximum defence mode!
Come on!
Power supply failing.
Forget the shooty dog thing.
Power supply failing.
It's the oil. Krillitane life forms can't handle the oil! That's it!
They've changed their physiology so often, even their own oil is toxic to them.
How much was there in the kitchens?
Barrels of it.
(SCREECHING) We need to get to the kitchens. Mickey...
What now? Hold the coats?
Get all the children unplugged and out of the school.
DOCTOR: Now, then, bats, bats, bats. How do we fight bats?
(FIRE ALARM SOUNDING) (SCREECHING IN PAIN) Get after them.
Master.
Come on, boy! Good boy.
Okay, listen, everyone, we've got to get out of here!
They've been deadlock sealed. Finch must have done it. I can't open them.
The vats would not withstand a direct hit from my laser, but my batteries are failing.
Right, everyone out the back door. K9, stay with me.
Everyone, get out. Now!
Come on! Move! Let's go, let's go!
Capacity for only one shot, master.
For maximum impact, I must be stationed directly beside the vat.
But you'll be trapped inside.
That is correct.
I can't let you do that.
No alternative possible, master.
(SCREECHING) ~Goodbye, old friend.
Goodbye, master.
You good dog. Affirmative.
Where's K9?
We need to run.
Where is he? What have you done?
When we find him, eat him if you must, but bring me his brain.
The little dog with the nasty bite.
Not so powerful now, are you?
Come on guys, let's go, let's go! Come on!
Burning!
You bad dog.
Affirmative, (CHEERING) Yes!
Did you have something to do with it?
Yeah, I did.
Oh, my God.
Kenny blew up the school! It was Kenny!
ALL: (CHANTING) Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
He was just a daft metal dog.
Fine, really.
Cup of tea?
You've redecorated.
Do you like it?
Oh, I do. Yeah.
I preferred it as it was, but it'll do.
I love it.
Hey, what's 47 times 369?
No idea.
It's gone now, the oil's faded.
But you're still clever.
More than a match for him.
You and me both.
ROSE: Doctor?
Um, we're about to head off, but you could come with us.
No.
I can't do this anymore.
Besides, I've got a much bigger adventure ahead.
Time I stopped waiting for you and found a life of my own.
Can I come?
Not with you, I mean, with you.
‘Cause I'm not the tin dog and I wanna see what's out there, Oh, go on, Doctor.
Sarah Jane Smith and Mickey Smith, you need a Smith on board.
Okay, then. I could do with a laugh.
Rose, is that okay?
No, great.
Why not?
Well, I better go.
What do I do?
Do I stay with him? “Yes.
Some things are worth getting your heart broken for.
Find me, if you need to one day. Find me.
It's daft, but I haven't ever thanked you for that time and like I said, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Something to tell the grandkids.
Oh, I think it'll be someone else's grandkids now.
Right, yes, sorry. I didn't get a chance to ask...
There hasn't been anyone... You know.
Well, there was this one guy. I travelled with him for a while, but he was a tough act to follow.
Goodbye, Doctor.
Oh, it's not goodbye.
You say it, please. This time.
Say it.
Goodbye.
My Sarah Jane.
(WHOOSHING) kg!
Mistress, But you were blown up.
The master rebuilt me.
My systems are much improved with new omni-flexible hyperlink facilities.
He replaced you with a brand-new model.
Affirmative, Yeah. He does that.
Come on, you. Home. We've got work to do.
Affirmative, 
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(SCREAMING) We are under attack. There are creatures.
I don't even think they're human. We can't stop them.
The clock is broken. He's coming.
Did you hear what I said?
Listen to me. There is a man coming to Versailles.
He has watched over me my whole life and he will not desert me tonight.
What are you talking about? What man?
The only man, save you, I have ever loved.
No, don't look like that. There's no time. You have your duties.
I am your mistress. Go to your queen.
Are you there? Can you hear me?
I need you now, you promised. The clock on the mantel is broken.
It is time.
Doctor! Doctor!
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) (WHOOSHING) It's a spaceship. Brilliant! I got a spaceship on my first go.
ROSE: Looks kind of abandoned. Anyone on board?
Nah, nothing here. Well, nothing dangerous.
Well, not that dangerous.
You know what? I'll just have a quick scan.
In case there's anything dangerous.
So, what's the date? How far have we gone?
About 3,000 years into your future, give or take.
(ELECTRONIC HUMMING) DOCTOR: 51st century.
The Dagmar Cluster, you're a long way from home, Mickey!
Two and a half galaxies.
Mickey Smith, meet the universe.
See anything you like?
It's so realistic!
Dear me, had some cowboys in here. Been a ton of repair work going on.
Now that's odd, look at that. All the warp engines are going.
Full capacity.
There's enough power running through this ship to punch a hole in the universe and we're not moving.
So where's all that power going?
Where'd all the crew go?
Good question. No life readings on board.
Well, we're in deep space. They didn’t just nip out for a quick fag.
No, I've checked all the smoking pods.
You smell that?
Yeah. Someone's cooking.
Sunday roast, definitely.
Now, there's something you don't see in your average spaceship.
18th century. French.
Nice mantel.
Not a hologram.
Not even a reproduction. This actually is an 18th-century French fireplace.
Double-sided. There's another room through there.
It can't be. That's the outer hull of the ship. Look.
Hello.
Hello?
What's your name?
Reinette.
Reinette. That's a lovely name.
Can you tell me where you are at the moment, Reinette?
In my bedroom.
And where's your bedroom? Where do you live, Reinette?
Paris of course.
Paris. Right.
Monsieur, what are you doing in my fireplace?
Oh, it's just a routine... fire check.
Can you tell me what year it is?
Of course I can. 1727.
Right, lovely, one of my favourites.
August is rubbish, though. Stay indoors.
Okay, that's all for now. Thanks for your help.
Hope you enjoy the rest of the fire. Night-night.
Good night, monsieur.
You said this was the 51st century.
I also said this ship was generating enough power to punch a hole in the universe.
I think we just found the hole.
Must be a spatio-temporal hyperlink.
What's that?
No idea, just made it up. Didn't want to say “magic door”.
And on the other side of the “magic door" it's France in 1727?
Well, she was speaking French. Right period French, too.
She was speaking English, I heard her.
That's the Tardis, translates for you.
Even French?
Yep.
Got you.
ROSE: Doctor!
(HORSES TROTTING) (GASPS) It's okay. Don't scream. It's me. It's the fireplace man, look.
We were talking. Just a moment ago. I was in your fireplace.
Monsieur, that was weeks ago. That was months.
Really? Hmm.
Must be a loose connection. Need to get a man in.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
(TICKING) Okay. That's scary.
You're scared of a broken clock?
Just a bit scared, yeah. Just a little tiny bit.
‘Cause, you see, if this clock's broken, and it's the only clock in the room, then what's that?
(TICKING) ‘Cause, you see, that's not a clock.
You can tell by the resonance. Too big.
Six feet, I'd say. Size of a man.
What is it?
Now let's think.
If you were a thing that ticked and you were hiding in someone's bedroom, first thing you do, break the clock.
No one notices the sound of one clock ticking, but two?
You might start to wonder if you're really alone.
Stay on the bed. Right in the middle.
Don't put your hands or feet over the edge.
Reinette, don't look round.
You stay exactly where you are.
Hold still, let me look.
You've been scanning her brain!
You've crossed two galaxies and thousands of years just to scan a child's brain?
What could there be in a little girl's mind worth blowing a hole in the universe?
I don't understand.
It wants me?
You want me?
Not yet. You are incomplete.
Incomplete? What does that mean, incomplete?
You can answer her, you can answer me. What do you mean, incomplete?
Monsieur, be careful!
It's just a nightmare, Reinette. Don't worry about it.
Everyone has nightmares.
Even monsters from under the bed have nightmares. Don't you, Monster?
What do monsters have nightmares about?
Me. Ha!
Doctor!
Excellent. Ice gun.
Fire extinguisher.
Where did that thing come from?
Here.
MICKEY: So why is it dressed like that?
Field trip to France. Some kind of basic camouflage protocol.
Nice needlework. Shame about the face.
Oh, you are beautiful!
No, really, you are. You're gorgeous. Look at that!
Space age clockwork. I love it. I've got chills!
Listen, seriously, I mean this from the heart, and by the way, count those, it would be a crime, it would be an act of vandalism, to disassemble you.
But that won't stop me.
(CREAKING) Short-range teleport. Can't have got far. Could still be on board.
What is it?
Don't go looking for it.
Where are you going?
Back in a sec.
He said not to look for it.
Yeah, he did.
Now you're getting it.
Reinette?
Just checking you're okay.
(PLAYING HARP) (CLEARING THROAT) Oh. Hello!
I was just looking for Reinette. This is still her room, isn't it?
I've been away, not sure how long.
WOMAN: Reinette? We're ready to go!
Go to the carriage, Mother, I will join you there.
It is customary, I think, to have an imaginary friend only during one’s childhood.
You are to be congratulated on your persistence, Reinette.
Well...
Goodness, how you've grown.
And you do not appear to have aged a single day.
That is tremendously impolite of you.
Right, yes, sorry. Um...
Listen, lovely to catch up but better be off, eh?
Don't want your mother finding you up here with a strange man, do we?
Strange? How could you be a stranger to me?
I have known you since I was seven years old.
Yeah, I suppose you have. I came the quick route.
You seem to be flesh and blood at any rate, but this is absurd.
Reason tells me you cannot be real.
Oh, you never want to listen to reason.
MAN: Mademoiselle? Your mother grows impatient.
A moment!
So many questions. So little time.
(DOOR SLAMMING) MAN: Mademoiselle Poisson!
Poisson?
Reinette Poisson. No!
No, no, no, no! No way! Reinette Poisson.
Later Madame d'Etioles. Later still, mistress of Louis XV, uncrowned Queen of France!
Actress, artist, musician, dancer, courtesan.
Fantastic gardener.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor. And I just snogged Madame de Pompadour.
(LAUGHS GLEEFULLY) Rose!
Mickey! Every time. Every time! It's rule one. Don't wander off.
I tell them, I do. Rule one.
There could be anything on this ship!
(NEIGHING) Are you looking at me?
(EXCLAIMS) Look! Look at this!
That's an eye in there. That's a real eye.
(RHYTHMIC BEATING) What is that?
What's that in the middle there? Looks like it's wired in.
It's a heart, Mickey.
It's a human heart.
Rose?
Will you stop following me? I'm not your mother.
So this is where you came from, eh, horsey?
(WOMEN GIGGLING) Oh, Katherine, you are too wicked.
Oh, speaking of wicked, I hear Madame de Chateauroux is ill and close to death.
Yes, I am devastated.
Oh, indeed.
I, myself, am frequently inconsolable.
KATHERINE: The King will therefore be requiring a new mistress.
You love the King, of course.
He is the King and I love him with all my heart.
And I look forward to meeting him.
(BIRD CALLING IN DISTANCE) Is something wrong, my dear?
Not wrong, no.
KATHERINE: Every woman in Paris knows your ambitions.
REINETTE: Every woman in Paris shares them.
You know, of course, that the King is to attend the Yew Tree Ball...
Maybe it wasn't a real heart.
Of course it was a real heart.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Is this, like, normal for you? Is this an average day?
Life with the Doctor, Mickey, no more average days.
It's France again. We can see France.
I think we're looking through a mirror.
Blimey, look at this guy!
Who does he think he is?
King of France.
Oh, here's trouble. What you been up to?
Oh, this and that.
Became the imaginary friend of a future French aristocrat, picked a fight with a clockwork man.
(HORSE WHINNYING) Oh, and I met a horse.
What's a horse doing on a spaceship?
Mickey, what's pre-revolutionary France doing on a spaceship?
Get a little perspective.
See these? They're all over the place, on every deck.
Gateways to history.
But not just any old history. Hers.
Time window.
Deliberately arranged along the life of one particular woman.
A spaceship from the 51st century stalking a woman from the 18th.
Why?
Who is she?
Jean-Antoinette Poisson. Known to her friends as Reinette, One of the most accomplished women who ever lived.
So has she got plans for being the queen, then?
No, he's already got a queen. She's got plans on being his mistress.
Oh, I get it. Camilla!
I think this is the night they met.
The night of the Yew Tree Ball.
In no time flat, she'll get herself established as his official mistress with her own rooms at the palace, even her own title.
Madame de Pompadour.
The Queen must have loved her.
No, she did. They got on very well.
The King's wife and the King's girlfriend?
France. It's a different planet.
(TICKING) How long have you been standing there? Show yourself!
Hello, Reinette, hasn't time flown!
Fireplace man!
(CREAKING) What's it doing?
Switching back on. Melting the ice.
And then what?
Then it kills everyone in the room.
Focuses the mind, doesn't it? Who are you? Identify yourself.
Order it to answer me.
Why should it listen to me?
I don't know, but it did when you were a child.
Let's see if you've still got it.
Answer his question.
Answer any and all questions put to you.
am Repair Droid 7.
And what happened to the ship, then?
There was a lot of damage.
Jon storm. 82% systems failure.
That ship hasn't moved in over a year. What's taken you so long?
We did not have the parts.
Always comes down to that, doesn’t it? The parts.
What's happened to the crew? Where are they?
We did not have the parts.
There should've been over 50 people on your ship. Where did they go?
We did not have the parts.
Fifty people don't just disappear, where...
Oh.
You didn’t have the parts so you used the crew.
The crew?
We found a camera with an eye in it.
And there was a heart wired into machinery.
It's just doing what it was programmed to.
Repairing the ship any way it can with whatever it can find, No one told it the crew weren't on the menu.
What did you say the flight deck smelled of?
Someone cooking.
Flesh plus heat.
Barbecue.
But what are you doing here?
You've opened up time windows, that takes colossal energy.
Why come here? You could've gone to your repair yard.
Instead you come to 18th-century France? Why?
One more part is required.
(CREAKING) Then why haven't you taken it?
She is incomplete.
What? So that’s the plan, then?
Just keep opening up more and more time windows, scanning her brain, checking to see if she's done yet?
Why her?
You've got all of history to choose from, why specifically her?
We are the same.
We're not the same. We are in no sense the same!
We are the same. ~Get out of here.
Get out of here this instant.
Reinette, no.
It's back on the ship! Rose, take Mickey and Arthur, get after it, follow it.
Don't approach it, just watch what it does.
Arthur?
Good name for a horse.
No, you're not keeping the horse.
I let you keep Mickey. Now go, go, go!
You're going to have to trust me. I need to find out what they're looking for.
There's only one way I can do that. Won't hurt a bit.
Fireplace man.
You are inside my mind.
Oh, dear, Reinette.
You've had some cowboys in here.
So, that Doctor, eh?
What are you talking about?
Well! Madame de Pompadour, Sarah Jane Smith.
Cleopatra...
Cleopatra! He mentioned her once!
Yeah, but he called her Cleo.
Mickey!
You are in my memories. You walk among them.
If there's anything you don’t want me to see, just imagine a door and close it. I won't look.
Oh, actually, there's a door just there, you might want to close...
Oh. Actually, several.
To walk among the memories of another living soul.
Do you ever get used to this?
I don't make a habit of it.
How can you resist?
What age are you?
So impertinent a question so early in the conversation.
How promising.
Not my question. Theirs.
You're 23. And for some reason that means you're not old enough.
Sorry. You might find old memories reawakening. Side effect.
Oh, such a lonely childhood.
It'll pass. Stay with me.
Oh, Doctor. So lonely. So very, very alone.
What do you mean, alone? You've never been alone in your life.
When did you start calling me Doctor?
Such a lonely little boy.
Lonely then and lonelier now.
How can you bear it?
How did you do that?
A door once opened may be stepped through in either direction.
Oh, Doctor.
My lonely Doctor.
Dance with me.
I can't.
Dance with me.
This is the night you dance with the King.
Then first I shall make him jealous.
I can't. Doctor.
Doctor who?
It's more than just a secret, isn't it?
What did you see?
That there comes a time, Time Lord, when every lonely little boy must learn how to dance.
(TICKING) What is this? What's going on? Doctor?
MICKEY: Rose?
They're going to chop us up. Just like the crew!
They're going to chop us up and stick us all over their stupid spaceship.
And where's the Doctor? Where's your precious Doctor now?
He's been gone for flipping hours, that's where he is!
You are compatible.
Well, you might want to think about that.
You really, really might because me and Mickey, we didn't come here alone, no, no.
And trust me, you wouldn't want to mess with our designated driver.
Ever heard of the Daleks? Remember them?
They had a name for our friend.
They had myths about him and a name. They called him the...
DOCTOR: # I could have danced all night (STUTTERING) They called him...
# And still have begged for more # I could have spread my wings And done a... # Have you met the French?
My God, they know how to party!
Oh, look at what the cat dragged in. The Oncoming Storm.
You sound just like your mother.
What have you been doing? Where have you been?
Well, among other things, I think I just invented the banana daiquiri a couple of centuries early.
Do you know, they'd never even seen a banana before?
Always take a banana to a party, Rose.
Bananas are good. Oh, brilliant.
It's you!
You're my favourite, you are.
You are the best. Do you know why?
‘Cause you're so thick.
You're Mr Thick Thick Thicketty Thick-face from Thick-town, Thickania.
And so is your dad.
Do you know what they were scanning Reinette's brain for?
Her milometer. They want to know how old she is.
Know why? ‘Cause this ship is 37 years old.
And they think when Reinette is 37, when she's complete, then her brain will be compatible.
‘Cause that's what you're missing, isn't it, hmm?
Command circuit, your computer.
Your ship needs a brain. And for some reason, God knows what, only the brain of Madame de Pompadour will do.
The brain is compatible.
Compatible?
If you believe that, you probably believe this is a glass of wine.
Multi-grade anti-oil. If it moves, it doesn't.
Right, you two, that’s enough lying about. Time we got the rest of the ship turned off.
Those things safe?
Yep, safe.
Safe and thick. The way I like them.
Okay, all the time windows are controlled from here.
Need to close them all down. Zeus plugs. Where are my Zeus plugs?
Had them a minute ago. I was using them as castanets.
Why didn't they just open a time window to when she was 37?
Amount of damage to these circuits, they did well to hit the right century.
Trial and error after that.
The windows aren't closing. Why won't they close?
(CHIMING) What's that?
I don't know.
Incoming message?
MICKEY: From who?
Report from the field.
One of them must still be out there with Reinette, That's why I can't close the windows. There's an override.
(CREAKING) That was a bit clever.
DOCTOR: Right. Many things about this are not good.
(CHIMING) Message from one of your little friends? Anything interesting?
She is complete. It begins.
What's happening?
One of them must have found the right time window.
It's time to send in the troops.
And this time they're bringing back her head.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) ROSE: Madame de Pompadour.
Please don’t scream or anything, we haven't got a lot of time.
We've come to warn you that they'll be here in five years.
Five years?
Sometime after your 37th birthday.
I, um, I can't give you an exact date, it's a bit random.
But they're coming. It's gonna happen.
In a way, for us, it's already happening.
I'm sorry, it's hard to explain. The Doctor does this better.
Then be exact and I will be attentive.
There isn't time.
There are five years.
For you. I haven't got five minutes.
Then also be concise.
Um...
There's a vessel.
A ship. A sort of sky ship. And it's full of...
Well, you.
Different bits of your life in different rooms. All jumbled up.
I told you it was complicated, sorry.
There is a vessel in your world where the days of my life are pressed together like the chapters of a book so that he may step from one to the other without increase of age while I, weary traveller, must always take the slower path.
He was right about you.
So in five years these creatures will return. What can be done?
The Doctor says keep them talking.
They're kind of programmed to respond to you now.
You won't be able to stop them, but you might be able to delay them a bit.
“Until?
Until the Doctor can get there.
He's coming, then?
He promises.
But he cannot make his promises in person?
He'll be there when you need him. That's the way it's got to be.
It's the way it's always been.
The monsters and the Doctor.
It seems you cannot have one without the other.
Tell me about it.
The thing is, you weren't supposed to have either.
Those creatures are messing with history.
None of this was ever supposed to happen to you.
Supposed to happen? What does that mean?
It happened, child. And I would not have it any other way.
One may tolerate a world of demons for the sake of an angel.
MICKEY: Rose? Rose!
Rose!
The time window where she's 37. We've found it, right under our noses.
No, you can't go in there. The Doctor will go mad.
So this is his world.
(WOMAN SCREAMING) What was that?
The time window. The Doctor fixed an audio link.
Those screams. Is that my future?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Then I must take the slower path.
REINETTE: Are you there? Can you hear me?
I need you now. You promised. The clock on the mantel is broken. It is time!
That's my voice.
Rose, come on, we've got to go. There's a problem.
Give me a moment.
You okay?
No.
I'm very afraid.
But you and I both know, don’t we, Rose?
The Doctor is worth the monsters.
REINETTE: Doctor! Doctor!
(SCREAMING) (CREAKING) Doctor!
We must go! No one is coming to help us.
You are complete. You will come.
(SCREAMING) You found it, then?
They knew I was coming, they've blocked it off.
Where are we going?
The teleport has limited range.
We must have proximity to the time portal.
Your words mean nothing. You are nothing.
How come they got in there?
They teleported.
As long as the ship and the ballroom are linked, their short-range teleports will do the trick.
We'll go in the Tardis.
We can't. We're part of events now.
Can't we just smash through?
Hyperplex this side, plate glass the other. We'd need a truck.
We don't have a truck.
I know!
We've got to try something!
No. Smash the glass, smash the time windows.
There'd be no way back.
Could everyone just calm down!
Please!
Such a commotion. Such distressing noise.
Kindly remember that this is Versailles.
This is the Royal Court and we are French.
I have made a decision.
And my decision is no.
I shall not be going with you today.
I have seen your world and I have no desire to set foot there again.
We do not require your feet.
(ALL GASPING) You think I fear you, but I do not fear you even now.
You are merely the nightmare of my childhood, the monster from under my bed.
And if my nightmare can return to plague me, then rest assured, so will yours.
(HORSE WHINNYING) (HORSE GALLOPING) (SCREAMING) Madame de Pompadour. You look younger every day.
What the hell is going on?
Oh. This is my lover, the King of France.
Yeah? Well, I'm the Lord of Time.
And I'm here to fix the clock.
(ALL GASPING) Forget it. It's over.
For you and for me.
Talk about seven years’ bad luck.
Try 3,000.
(CREAKING) MICKEY: What happened?
Where did the time window go? How's he gonna get back?
The link with the ship is broken. No way back.
You don't have the parts.
How many ticks left in that clockwork heart, huh?
A day? An hour?
It's over. Accept that.
I'm not winding you up.
Are you all right?
What's happened to them?
They've stopped.
They have no purpose now.
We can't fly the Tardis without him.
How's he gonna get back?
You know all their names, don't you?
I saw that in your mind.
The name of every star.
What's in a name?
Names are just titles. Titles don't tell you anything.
Like "the Doctor"?
Like "Madame de Pompadour”.
I have often wished to see those stars a little closer.
Just as you have, I think.
From time to time.
In saving me, you trapped yourself.
Did you know that would happen?
Hmm, pretty much.
Yet still you came.
Yeah, I did, didn't I? Catch me doing that again.
There were many doors between my world and yours.
Can you not use one of the others?
When the mirror broke, the shock would've severed all the links with the ship.
There'll be a few more broken mirrors and torn tapestries around here I'm afraid, wherever there was a time window.
(STAMMERING) I'll pay for any damage.
That's a thought, I'm gonna need money.
I've always been a bit vague about money.
Where do you get money?
So here you are.
My lonely angel.
Stuck on the slow path with me.
Yep. The slow path.
Here's to the slow path.
(REINETTE LAUGHS) It's a pity. I think I would have enjoyed the slow path.
Well, I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, aren't you?
Take my hand.
It's not a copy. It's the original.
Thad it moved here and was exact in every detail.
The fireplace.
The fireplace from your bedroom.
When did you do this?
Many years ago.
In the hope that a door once opened may someday open again.
One never quite knows when one needs one's doctor.
It appears undamaged. Do you think it will still work?
You broke the bond with the ship when you moved it.
Which means it was off-line when the mirror broke.
That's what saved it.
But...
the link is basically physical and it's still physically here, which might just mean, if I'm lucky, if I'm very, very, very, very, very lucky...
Aha!
What?
Loose connection!
Need to get a man in!
Wish me luck.
No.
Madame de Pompadour!
Still wanna see those stars?
More than anything.
Give me two minutes. Pack a bag.
Am I going somewhere?
Go to the window. Pick a star. Any star.
How long did you wait?
Five and half hours.
Great! Always wait five and half hours.
Where've you been?
Explain later. Into the Tardis. With you in a sec!
DOCTOR: Reinette, Are you there, Reinette?
Reinette?
Oh, hello.
You just missed her.
~She'll be in Paris by 6:00.
Oh.
Good Lord!
She was right.
She said you never looked a day older.
So many years since I saw you last, but not a day of it on your face.
She spoke of you many times.
Often wished you'd visit again.
You know how women are.
(HORSES WHINNYING) (CARRIAGE DEPARTING) And there she goes.
Leaving Versailles for the last time.
Only 43 when she died.
Too young.
Too young.
Illness took her in the end.
She always did work too hard.
What does she say?
Of course.
Quite right.
ROSE: Why her?
Why did they think they could repair the ship with the head of Madame de Pompadour?
We'll probably never know.
There's massive damage in the computer memory decks.
Probably got confused.
The Tardis can close down the time windows now the droids have gone.
Should stop it causing any more trouble.
You all right?
I'm always all right.
Come on, Rose, it's time you showed me round the rest of this place.
REINETTE: “My dear Doctor, “the path has never seemed more slow and yet I fear I am nearing its end.
"Reason tells me that you and I are unlikely to meet again, “but I think I shall not listen to reason.
"I have seen the world inside your head and know that all things are possible.
“Hurry, though, my love, “My days grow shorter now and I am so very weak.
"Godspeed, my lonely angel.” (WHOOSHING) DOCTOR: So this is London.
An alternative to our world where everything's the same but a little bit different.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(WHIRRING) The prototype has passed every test, sir. It's working.
I hardly think “working” is the correct word.
That would apply only to machines.
I'm sorry. I should say, “It's alive." ~Can it hear me?
It might still be in shock.
Bear in mind the brain has been welded to the exoskeleton.
Skin of metal.
And a body that will never age or die.
I envy it. Do you know me?
Answer. Do you know me?
You are John Lumic.
My child.
Mark this day, Dr Kendrick. We are blessed.
Well, it's not quite over yet, sir. We need Geneva's approval.
Technically, this is a new form of life, and that contravenes the Bio-Convention.
They'd need to ratify this.
And they will refuse me.
Nonetheless, we need to tell them.
And if I don't?
Well, I'm sorry, sir, but it's my duty. I shall have to inform them.
And how will you do that from beyond the grave?
I don't quite understand.
Kill him.
Captain.
Yas, sir?
Inform all staff we have a new destination.
Set sail for Great Britain!
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) DOCTOR: ... and that weird munchkin lady with the big eyes.
You remember the way she looked at you?
Then she opens her mouth and fire comes out!
ROSE: I thought I was gonna get frazzled!
Yeah, one minute she's standing there, the next minute, roar!
Where was that? What happened?
Oh, it was on this... er, planet thing.
Asteroid. It's a long story. You had to be there.
What are you doing that for?
‘Cause you told me to.
When was that?
About half an hour ago.
Um... You can let go now.
Well, how long’s it been since I could've stopped?
Ten minutes. Twenty. Twenty nine.
You just forgot me!
No, no, no, I was just...
I was calibrating. I know exactly what I'm doing.
What's happened?
The time vortex. It's gone.
That's impossible. It’s just gone!
Brace yourselves! We're gonna crash!
Everyone all right? Rose? Mickey?
I'm fine, I'm okay, sorry, yeah.
DOCTOR: She's dead.
The Tardis is dead.
You can fix it.
There's nothing to fix. She's perished.
The last Tardis in the universe. Extinct.
ROSE: We can get help, yeah?
Where from?
Well, we've landed. We've got to be somewhere.
We fell out of the vortex, through the void, into nothingness.
We're in some sort of no place.
The Silent Realm. The Lost Dimension.
Otherwise known as London.
London, England, Earth! Hold on...
It's the 1st of February. This year. Not exactly far flung, is it?
~So this is London?
Yup.
Your city?
That's the one, Just as we left it?
Bang on.
And that includes the zeppelins?
What the hell?
That's beautiful.
Okay, so it's London with a big International Zeppelin Festival.
DOCTOR: This is not your world.
But if the date's the same... It's parallel, right?
Am I right? Like a parallel Earth only they've got zeppelins?
Am | right? I'm right, aren't 1?
Must be.
A parallel world where...
Come on, you've seen it on films.
Like an alternative to our world where everything's the same but a little different.
Like, I don't know, traffic lights are blue, Tony Blair never got elected...
And he's still alive.
A parallel world where my dad's still alive.
Don't look at it, Rose. Don't even think about it. This is not your world.
He's my dad. And...
Trust me on this.
Oh, that's weird. But he's real...
Trust me on this.
He's a success.
He was always planning these daft little schemes, health food drinks and stuff. Everyone said they were useless.
But he did it.
Rose, if you ever trusted me, then listen to me now.
Stop looking at him. Your father's dead.
He died when you were six months old. That is not your Pete. That is a Pete.
For all we know he's got his own Jackie. His own Rose.
His own daughter who is someone else, but not you. You can't see him.
Not ever.
Trust me on this. Trust me on this. Trust me on this. Trust me on this.
Hello? Sweetheart? Only me.
Oh, the bad penny. Was this your idea?
Don't deny it. It's got your fingerprints all over it.
"Trust me on this." Oh, I can trust you all right. Trust you to cock it up.
What have I done now?
Have a look.
What's wrong with that?
4Q! It says 40.
You are 40.
I don't want the whole world telling, do 1?
You're having a party tonight!
My 39th!
My official biography says I was born on the same day as Cuba Gooding, Jr.
And that makes me 39, thank you very much.
Rose, Come here. Rose.
These are from the girls in the office. Happy birthday.
I've got hand sculpted arrangements by Veronica of Reykjavik and your secretary stopped off at a garage. I don't think so, And if you're giving out presents, where's my zeppelin?
Everyone else has got one. Rose! Come on, Rose!
Bet you didn't even notice, did you? Special delivery. Got sent round today.
Birthday present from Mr Lumic, latest model.
Diamond studded. Pick up signals from Venezuela.
Why would you want to pick up signals from Venezuela?
Well, I don't know, but now I can find out! For God's sake, where is she? Rose!
She needs a good bath before tonight or she's gonna be honking. Rose!
Come to mummy, come on!
There you are, my darling.
(BEEPING) Mr Lumic!
Jackie was just saying thank you. That's very kind of you.
Those Ear Pods are handmade. Tell her to take care.
Course I will. Course I will.
I don't suppose you'll be joining us tonight, for the party?
We'd be very honoured.
The world below can party. Some of us have work to do.
My plans have advanced, Peter. The President has promised a decision.
I'm flying in now. We will be at the airstrip by 5:00.
Right. It's just that I promised I'd help the wife out tonight.
If the President of Great Britain can make this meeting, then so can you.
He's not married to Jackie, is he?
5:00, Mr Tyler. A famous day!
Voice print access, John Lumic.
Initiate Ear Pod override.
Subject: Jacqueline Tyler.
LUMIC: Activate, Download. Tyler residence, February the 1st.
Give me security arrangements for tonight, passwords, encryption services.
And restore.
Thank you, Mrs Tyler.
Activate picture link.
Mr Crane.
Mr Lumic.
Events are moving faster than I anticipated.
I need extra staff.
Very good, sir. I shall go on a recruitment drive.
Back her up.
DOCTOR: I told you to keep an eye on her. MICKEY: She's all right.
She goes wandering off...
A parallel world, it's like a gingerbread house.
All those temptations calling her.
So it's just Rose, then? Nothing out there to tempt me?
Well, I don't know. I can't worry about everything!
If I could just get this thing to...
Did that help?
Yes.
Did that hurt?
Yes. Ow.
(ZEPPELINS WHIRRING) (BEEPING) .. and it’s good news for Great Britain as John Lumic returns to the country of his birth, Mr Lumic, the inventor of High Content metal, has denied allegations of ill health.
We're all flesh and blood, but the brain is what makes us human.
And my mind is more creative than ever.
With shares in Cybus Industries doubling in price, Mr Lumic has pledged more support for the homeless in New South America.
In other news.
The Torchwood Institute has published a study claiming that...
We're not meant to be here.
The Tardis draws its power from the universe but it's the wrong universe.
It's like diesel in a petrol engine.
But I've seen it in comics, people go hopping from one alternative world to another. It's easy!
Not in the real world.
Used to be easy.
When the Time Lords kept their eye on everything, you could pop between realities, home in time for tea.
Then they died and took it all with them.
The walls of reality closed. The worlds were sealed.
Everything became that bit less kind.
Then how did we get here?
I don't know. Accident.
Should've been impossible, now we're trapped.
What's that?
What?
That there. Is that a reflection?
It's a light! Is it? Is that a light? I think that's a light.
That's all we need. We've got power! Mickey, we've got power!
Gentlemen, gentlemen! I beg your attention!
Christmas has come early so come and get it!
Oh, smell that, comrades!
Burgers and chips! Sausage and beans!
Pork, chicken and hot sweet tea. All for free!
Don't go!
But there's food, All you can eat, free of charge!
Don't just stand there. Fill your faces with pasties...
They're lying.
It's easy for you to say. When did you last starve?
All those people disappearing off the streets.
It's been going on for months. It's them.
They're taking you away.
What for?
Experiments.
I'm so hungry.
So come and get it while it's hot!
That's it, kind sir, get in there and fill your face!
Feast yourself, brother, feast yourself.
(SCREAMING) What are you doing!
Take them away.
No! No! Help!
DOCTOR: It's alive!
What is it?
Nothing.
It's tiny. It's one of those insignificant little power cells that no one ever bothers about and it's clinging on to life!
It's got one little ounce of reality, tucked away inside.
Enough to get us home?
Not yet.
I need to charge it up.
We could go outside and lash it up to the national grid.
Wrong sort of energy. It's got to come from our universe.
But we don't have anything.
There's me, I just gave away 10 years of my life. Worth every second.
It's going out. Is that okay?
It's on a recharging cycle. It'll loop round, power back up and be ready to take us home in 24 hours.
So that gives us 24 hours on a parallel world?
Shore leave.
So long as we keep our heads down, easy, no problem. Let's go and tell her.
There you are! It's all right, no applause, I fixed it.
24 hours and then we're flying back to reality.
What is it?
My phone connected. There's this Cybus network. It finds your phone.
It gave me internet access.
Rose, whatever it says, this is the wrong world.
I don't exist.
What do you mean?
There's no Rose Tyler. I was never born.
There's Pete, my dad, and Jackie.
He still married Mum but they never had kids.
Give me that phone.
They're rich. They've got a house and cars and everything they want.
But they haven't got me.
I've got to see them.
You can't.
I just want to see them.
I can't let you.
You just said 24 hours.
You can't become their daughter.
That's not the way it works. Mickey, tell her.
24 hours, yeah?
Where are you going?
Well, I can do what I want.
I've got the address and everything.
Stay where you are! Both of you! Rose, come back!
Mickey, come back here! Right now!
I just want to see them.
Yeah, I've got things to see and all.
Like what?
You don't know anything about me, do you? It's always about Rose.
I'm just a spare part.
I'm sorry, I've got to go.
Go on, then. There's no choice, is there?
You can only chase after one of us and it's never gonna be me, is it?
Back here. 24 hours.
Yeah. If I haven't found something better.
Mr Tyler, what's the matter couldn't wait until tonight?
Mr President. Honoured. I'm on the fast-track programme.
Cybus Industries have bought up my company so I'm part of the firm now.
Some people say they've bought my government.
I've never heard anybody say that. Never.
You can trust me on this.
I tried your drink, that Vitex stuff. It tastes like pop.
Well, it is pop.
You've made money by selling a health food drink to a sick world, Not quite the ordinary Joe you appear to be, are you?
(SIGHING) He does like to keep us waiting.
But tell me, you've had a chance to observe John Lumic more than most.
What's your opinion?
He's very sharp, I'd say, sharp as ever.
Very clever man. Brilliant, in fact.
Then you don't think he's insane?
It's not the word I would've used, no.
I see.
Am | all right to go past?
Yeah.
No bother. Curfew doesn't start till 10:00.
There's a curfew?
Course there is, Where you been living, mate? Up there with the toffs?
I wish.
See you.
Mickey's mum just couldn't cope.
His dad hung around for a while, but then he just sort of wandered off.
He was brought up by his gran. She was such a great woman.
God, she used to slap him!
But then she died. She tripped and fell down the stairs.
It was about five years ago now. I was still in school.
I never knew.
Well, you never asked.
You never said.
That's Mickey. I suppose...
we just take him for granted.
Do you think she's still alive? His gran?
Could be.
Like I said, parallel world, gingerbread house.
We need to get out of here as fast as we can.
(BEEPING) What are they all doing?
They've stopped.
It's the ear pieces.
Like Bluetooth attachments but everyone's connected together.
(BEEPING) It's on my phone. It's automatic. Look, it's downloading.
Is this what they're all getting?
ROSE: News, international news, sport, weather.
They get it direct. Downloaded right into their heads.
TV schedules, lottery numbers.
Everyone shares the same information.
Daily download, published by Cybus Industries.
(ALL LAUGHING) You lot, you're obsessed. You'll do anything for the latest upgrade.
Oi, they're not my lot. Different world, remember?
It's not so far off your world. This place is only parallel.
Oh, look at that.
Cybus Industries, owners of just about every company in Britain, including Vitex.
Mr Pete Tyler's very well connected.
Okay, I give up. Let's go and see him.
WOMAN: Who's that there?
Who is it? I know you're there.
Shame on you, tricking an old lady. I've got nothing worth stealing.
And don't think I'm gonna disappear. You're not gonna take me!
Hi.
Is that you?
It's me. I came home.
Ricky!
It's Mickey.
I know my own grandson's name. It's Ricky. Now come here.
Okay, I'm Ricky. Of course I am. Ricky, that's me.
You stupid boy!
Ow!
Where've you been?
Stop hitting me!
It's been days and days.
I keep hearing all these stories, people disappearing off the street.
There's nothing official on the download but there are all these rumours and whispers.
I thought they'd gone and disappeared you.
That carpet on the stairs, I told you to get it fixed. You're gonna...
fall and break your neck.
Well, you get it fixed for me!
I should've done it way back. I guess I'm just kind of useless.
Now, I never said that.
Tam, though.
And I'm sorry, Gran. I'm so sorry.
Don't talk like that. Do you know what you need?
A nice sit down and a cup of tea.
You got time?
For you, I've got all the time in the world.
Oh, you say that but it's all talk.
It's those new friends of yours. I don't trust them.
What friends are they?
Don't pretend you don't know.
You've been seen. Mrs Chan told me.
Driving about, all helter-skelter, in that van.
What van's that, then?
You know full well. Don't play games with me.
Get inside.
I've been looking for you everywhere!
Ricky. Ricky!
Ricky, you were the one who told us.
You don't contact your family ‘cause it puts them in danger.
Yeah. Ricky said that. Course I did. Just testing.
I saw them. I taped them.
They went round Blackfriars gathering up the homeless like the Child Catcher.
They must have took four dozen.
The vans were hired out to a company called International Electromatics.
But I did a protocol search, turns out that's a dummy company established by guess who?
I don't know. Who?
TOGETHER: Cybus Industries!
Well, now we've got evidence!
Bad news is they've arrested Thin Jimmy.
So that just leaves you.
Leaves me what?
The number one.
Top of the list.
London's most wanted.
Okay. Cool.
Say that again.
LUMIC: The most precious thing on this earth is the human brain and yet we allow it to die.
But now Cybus Industries has perfected a way of sustaining the brain indefinitely within a cradle of copyrighted chemicals.
And the latest advances in synapse research allows cyberkinetic impulses to be bonded onto a metal exoskeleton.
This is the ultimate upgrade.
Our greatest step into cyberspace.
I'm sorry, could we stop it there?
I don't need the pitch. I think we all know what this ultimate upgrade entails.
And I'm here to tell you, John, the answer is no.
My government does not give you permission.
And I think no government ever will.
I've prepared a paper for the Ethical Committee.
Oh, come on!
It's not just unethical, it's obscene.
Mr President, if I might make a personal plea.
I am dying, sir.
I'm aware of that.
And I'm very sorry.
Without this project, you have condemned me.
My inventions have advanced this whole planet.
Would you have all that perish?
You're a fine businessman, John.
But you're not God.
I'm really very sorry but I think we should end it there, Mr Tyler, I'll see you tonight.
I think we could all do with a drink.
Mr Lumic.
Still, it's not the only country in the world. There's always New Germany.
This is the homeland.
My birthplace.
You may leave.
Thank you, sir.
Mr Crane!
Ready and waiting, sir.
Did the override work?
Well, it needs a bit of fine tuning. We weren't exactly delicate given the rush.
But, yeah, yeah, it’s all working.
I've been testing the system, sir.
They've grafted on a treat, these have.
Given a little persuasion.
If you'd care to observe, sir.
And turn to the right.
And back to the left.
Are you having fun, Mr Crane?
No, no, not at all, sir, no. It's just... Well, it's irresistible.
Then resist and start the upgrade.
Did we get permission?
Tam governed by greater laws, old friend.
The right of a man to survive. Now begin!
And turn to the left.
Forward march.
(ELECTRICAL BUZZING) (SCREAMING) Whoa! Let's cover up that noise. Give us track number 19.
(THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT BY TIGHT FIT PLAYING) (SCREAMING) (MEN WAILING) There's a light on. There's someone inside the base, Mrs Moore, we've got visitors.
One, two, three, go!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing there?
What am I doing here?
What am I doing there?
They've got visitors.
February the 1st. Mum's birthday.
Even in a parallel universe, she still loves a party.
Well, given Pete Tyler's quest list, I wouldn't mind a look.
And there is one guaranteed way of getting inside...
Psychic paper.
Who do you want to be?
(BOTTLE POPPING) We could've been anyone.
It got us in, didn't it?
You're in charge of the psychic paper. We could've been guests.
Celebrities. Sir Doctor, Dame Rose.
And we end up serving. I did enough of this back home.
If you want to know what's going on, work in the kitchen.
According to Lucy, that man over there...
Who's Lucy?
She's carrying the salmon pinwheels.
Oh, that's Lucy, is it?
Yeah.
Lucy says that is the President of Great Britain.
What, there's a president, not a prime minister?
Seems so.
Or maybe Lucy's just a bit thick.
PETE: Excuse me, thank you very much.
Thank you, if I could have your attention please.
MAN 1: Come on, Pete. PETE: Thank you very much.
I'd just like to say thank you to you all for coming on this very special occasion.
My wife's...
39th.
(ALL LAUGHING) Trust me on this.
And so without any further ado, here she is, the birthday girl, my lovely wife, Jackie Tyler.
Now, I'm not giving a speech, that's what my parties are famous for, no work, no politics.
Just a few good mates and plenty of black market whisky.
Pardon me, Mr President.
So, yeah, get on with it. Enjoy! Enjoy.
(ALL CHEERING) You can't stay. Even if there was some way of telling them.
Course I can't.
I've still got Mum at home, my real mum. I couldn't just leave her, could 1?
It's just...
They've got each other.
Mum's got no one.
She's got you. Those two haven't.
All these different worlds, not one of them gets it right.
JACKIE: Rose!
Here's my little girl! Come to mummy, come to mummy, yes.
Good girl, aren't you!
Sorry.
MECHANICAL VOICE: Platoon 02 now boarding.
Platoon 02 now boarding.
Stop staring.
But what are they, sir? I'm told they're the future.
Ain't technology wonderful?
Go on, get to the cab, start her up.
Sir.
(RINGING) LUMIC: Mr Crane, are we mobile?
Just about to hit the road, sir. And yourself?
I'm arriving, Mr Crane. Prepare the factory.
(ZEPPELIN WHIRRING) Now send them forth, old friend. Let the good work begin.
(BEEPING) He's clean. No bugs.
But this is off the scale.
He's flesh and blood. How did that happen?
Well, it could be that Cybus Industries have perfected the science of human cloning.
Or, your father had a bike.
And your name's Mickey, not Ricky?
Mickey.
Dad was Jackson Smith, used to work at the key cutter’s on Clifton Parade.
Went to Spain, never came back.
But that's my dad.
So... we're brothers?
Be fair, what else could it be?
I don't know.
But he doesn't just look like me. He is exactly the same.
There's something else going on here, Jake.
So who are you lot?
We? We are the Preachers.
As in “gospel truth".
Do you see? No Ear Pods.
While the rest of the world downloads from Cybus Industries, we have got freedom.
You're talking to London's most wanted.
But target number one is Lumic and we are going to bring him down.
From your kitchen?
Have you got a problem with that?
No. It's a good kitchen.
(BEEPING) It's an upload from Gemini.
Who's Gemini?
The vans are back. They are moving out of Battersea.
Looks like Gemini was right, Lumic’s finally making a move.
And we are right behind him. Pack up, we're leaving.
(HORN BLARING) I remember her 21st.
Pint of cider in the George.
Sorry, sir, champagne?
Might as well, I'm paying for it.
Big night for you.
For her.
Still, she's happy.
Yeah, she should be. It's a great party.
Do you think?
You can trust me!
"You can trust me on this." That's it, sorry. Yeah.
So, how long have you two been married?
20 years.
No kids, or...
We kept putting it off.
She said she didn't want to spoil her figure.
It's not too late. She's only 40.
39.
All right, 39.
It's still too late.
I moved out last month.
We're gonna keep it quiet, you know. It's bad for business.
Why am telling you all this? We haven't met before, have we?
I don't know, you just seem sort of...
What?
I don't know. Just sort of...
right.
Stevie, how's things? How's it going at Torchwood?
I don't know what they're doing, but this seems to be the target.
Big house, fair bit of money. Now we've got to find a way to get in there.
I've identified the address, it belongs to Peter Tyler, the Vitex millionaire.
Pete Tyler?
He's listed as one of Lumic's henchmen, a traitor to the state.
But... We've got to get in there!
Now shut it, duplicate. That's what I just said.
What are they doing?
(HEAVY FOOTSTEPS) What the hell are they?
LUMIC: The most precious thing on this earth is the human brain...
Mrs Tyler, is there anything I can get you?
The last 20 years back.
I could manage a glass of champagne.
Or a nice cup of tea?
Oh, that'd do me.
My mum loves that.
End of a long night, she never goes straight to bed.
She always stays up just to have that last cup of tea.
Oh, I'm the same.
Two sugars.
And me.
And Pete always says, you know...
Never mind him.
I was talking to him earlier. He's a nice man.
You know, a bit of a Jack the lad, I suppose, even if he has got money.
But he's a good bloke.
Better than most.
He's worth a second chance.
Are you commenting on my marriage?
No, I was just...
Who the hell do you think you are? You're staff.
You're nothing but staff. You're just the serving girl for God's sake!
And you are certainly not getting paid.
Don't you dare talk to me.
(LOUD FOOTSTEPS) LUMIC: This is the ultimate upgrade. Our greatest step into cyberspace.
Cybus.
It's happening again.
What do you mean?
I've seen them before.
What are they?
Cybermen.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) Mr Lumic.
Mr President. I suppose a remark about crashing the party would be appropriate at this point, sir.
I forbade this.
These are my children, sir.
Would you deny my family?
What are they? Robots?
Worse than that.
Who were these people?
It doesn't matter.
They're people?
They were. Till they had all their humanity taken away.
That's a living brain jammed inside a cybernetic body.
With a heart of steel, all emotions removed.
Why no emotions?
Because it hurts, I demand to know, Lumic, these people, who were they?
They were homeless and wretched and useless, until I saved them, and elevated them, and gave them life eternal.
And now I leave you in their capable hands. Good night, sir.
Good night, Mr President.
CYBERMAN: We have been upgraded.
Into what?
The next level of mankind.
We are Human Point Two.
Every citizen will receive a free upgrade.
You will become like us.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry for what's been done to you.
But listen to me.
This experiment ends tonight.
Upgrading is compulsory.
And if I refuse? Don't.
What if I refuse?
I'm telling you, don't!
What happens if I refuse?
Then you are not compatible.
What happens then?
You will be deleted.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) Jackie?
PETE: Jackie?
DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do.
But my mum's in there.
She's not your mother, come on!
Pete! Pete!
Pete, is there a way out?
The side gates.
Who are you? How do you know so much?
DOCTOR: You wouldn't believe it in a million years.
Who's that?
RICKY: Get behind me!
Oh, my God, look at you!
I thought I'd never see you again.
Yeah, no offence, sweetheart, but who the hell are you?
Rose!
That's not me. That's, like, the other one.
Oh, as if things weren't bad enough, there's two Mickeys!
It's Ricky.
But there's more of them.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) We're surrounded.
Put the guns down. Bullets won't stop them.
You! Stop shooting! Now!
We surrender.
Hands up.
There's no need to damage us. We're good stock.
We volunteer for the upgrade programme. Take us to be processed.

What's happened?
The time vortex. It's gone.
Well, we've landed. We've got to be somewhere.
It's parallel, right? Like a parallel Earth only they've got zeppelins?
Am I right? I'm right, aren't 1?
A parallel world where my dad's still alive.
DOCTOR: Rose, he's not your father and she is not your mother.
What's that? Mickey, we've got power!
You're a fine businessman, John.
But you're not God.
What am I doing there?
He doesn't just look like me. He is exactly the same.
ROSE: What are they?
Cybermen.
Come on!
There's no need to damage us. We're good stock.
We volunteer for the upgrade programme. Take us to be processed.
You are rogue elements.
But we surrender.
You are incompatible.
But this is a surrender!
You will be deleted.
But we're surrendering! Listen to me! We surrender!
You are inferior.
Man will be reborn as Cyberman but you will perish under maximum deletion.
Delete. Delete. Delete, (DOCTOR WHO THEME) What the hell was that?
Or how about instead, run!
(HORN HONKING) Everybody in!
I've got to go back. My wife's in there.
Anyone inside that house is dead.
If you want to help, then don't let her die for nothing.
You've got to come with us right now.
Come on, get a move on.
Rose, she's not your mother.
I know.
Come on.
Finished chatting? Never seen a slower getaway in my life!
What was that thing?
Little bit of technology from my home.
It's stopped glowing. Has it run out?
It's on a revitalising loop. It'll charge back up in about four hours.
~So we don't have a weapon anymore?
Yeah, we've got weapons.
Might not work on those metal things but they're good enough for men like him.
Leave him alone! What's he done wrong?
Oh, you know, just laid a trap that's wiped out the government and left Lumic in charge.
If I was part of all that, do you think I'd leave my wife inside?
Maybe your plan went wrong. Still gives us the right to execute you, though.
Talk about executions, you'll make me your enemy.
And take some really good advice, you don't want to do that.
All the same, we have evidence that says Pete Tyler's been working for the Lumic since 20.5.
Is that true?
Tell them, Mrs M.
We've got a government mole who feeds us information.
Lumic’s private files, his South American operations, the lot.
Secret broadcasts twice a week.
Broadcasts from Gemini?
And how do you know that?
I'm Gemini! That's me!
RICKY: Yeah, well, you would say that.
Encrypted wavelength 657, using binary 9.
That's the only reason I was working for Lumic, to get information.
I thought I was broadcasting to the security services. What do I get?
Scooby Doo and his gang. They've even got the van.
No, no, but the Preachers know what they're doing.
Ricky said he's London's most wanted.
Yeah, that's not exactly...
Not exactly what?
I'm London's most wanted for parking tickets.
Great.
They were deliberate. I was fighting the system.
Park anywhere, that's me.
Good policy. I do much the same.
I'm the Doctor by the way, if anyone's interested.
And I'm Rose. Hello, Even better. That's the name of my dog.
Still, at least I've got the catering staff on my side.
I knew you weren't a traitor.
Why's that, then?
I just did.
They took my wife.
She might still be alive.
That's even worse ‘cause that's what Lumic does.
He takes the living and he turns them into those machines.
Cybermen.
They're called Cybermen.
And I'd take those Ear Pods off if I were you.
You never know, Lumic could be listening.
But he's over-reached himself. He's still just a businessman.
He's assassinated the President.
All we need to do is get to the city and inform the authorities.
Because I promise you, this ends tonight.
LUMIC: My everlasting children. Tell me, how does it feel?
We feel nothing.
But in your mind, what do you think?
We think the same. We are uniform.
But you think of what?
We think of the humans. We think of their difference and their pain.
They suffer in the skin. They must be upgraded.
Excellent. Then let's begin.
Computer, identify John Lumic.
COMPUTER: Voice print acknowledged.
Activate Ear Pod primary sequence.
Please state area of activation.
The city of London.
I’ve just declared independence.
Begin transmission.
(EAR PODS BEEPING) LUMIC: They will come to me. My new children, The immortal ones, The whole of London has been sealed off.
There are reports of an army, an army of metal men.
All citizens should remove their Ear Pods. I repeat, remove all Ear Pods.
London has been placed under martial law.
If you are hearing this, stay in your homes. I repeat, stay in your homes.
(GRUNTING) (LOUD BUZZING) Oh, no, you don't.
MRS MOORE: What the hell? ROSE: What's going on?
It's the Ear Pods. Lumic's taken control.
Can't we just, I don’t know, take them off?
Don't. It'll cause a brainstorm.
The human race, for such an intelligent lot, you aren't half susceptible.
Give anyone a chance to take control and you submit.
Sometimes I think you like it. Easy life.
Hey. Come and see.
ROSE: Where are they all going? DOCTOR: I don't know.
Lumic must have a base of operations.
Battersea. That's where he was building his prototypes.
Why's he doing it?
He's dying.
This all started out as a way of prolonging life, keeping the brain alive.
At any cost.
Thing is, I've seen Cybermen before, haven't 1?
The head, those handle shapes, in Van Statten's Museum.
Oh, there are Cybermen in our universe.
They started on an ordinary world just like this, then swarmed across the galaxy.
This lot are a parallel version. They're starting from scratch here on Earth.
What the hell are you two on about?
Never mind. Come on, we need to get out of the city.
Okay, split up. Mrs Moore, you look after that lot.
Jake, distract them, go right, I'll go left. We'll meet back at Bridge Street. Move.
I'm going with him.
Come on. Let's go.
DOCTOR: Back!
Which way? I don't know where we are.
Did they see us?
Do they know where we are?
I bet they saw us.
I bet they saw us in the dark.
They know where we are.
They know where we are.
I don't get it. What is it with you? You are exactly like me.
I don't know. I reckon you're braver.
Oh, yeah. Ten times.
Still, your friends aren't bad, I'll give you that.
Oh, that's the Doctor and Rose. I just tag along behind.
Well, then you're not that bad.
Do you think?
Yeah, suppose.
(STOMPING) Cybermen.
Split up! Split up!
(WHISPERING) Go.
TANNOY: Chamber 12 now closed for sterilisation.
All reject stock will be incinerated.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
No!
CYBERMAN: This one is un-programmed.
Mr Crane, I thought you were one of the faithful.
Oh, that I am, sir. My Ear Pod must have malfunctioned, for which I apologise.
If I might?
I'd like to request an upgrade, sir.
I've seen the future and it's copyright Cybus Industries.
Sign me up.
A willing volunteer?
You've known me a long time, sir.
Quite a team, you and me. I've been with you all the way.
But believe me, sir, knowing you so well, I know exactly what to do.
No!
No! Help me!
Die, you...
Help me!
You are in pain. We can remove pain forever.
No. Not yet. I'm not ready.
We will give you immortality.
I've told you, I will upgrade only with my last breath.
Then breathe no more.
No. No. I command you. No!
(GASPING) I ran past the river, you should've seen it. The whole city’s on the march.
Hundreds of Cybermen, all down the Thames.
Here he is, Which one are you? I'm sorry, the Cybermen, he couldn't...
Are you Ricky?
Are you Ricky?
Mickey, that's you, isn't it?
Yeah.
He tried. He was running. There was too many of them.
Shut it.
There was nothing I could do.
I said just shut it!
Don't even talk about him.
You're nothing, you are.
Nothing.
We can mourn him when London is safe.
For now, we move on.
The whole of London's been sealed off and the entire population's been taken inside that place.
To be converted.
We've got to get in there and shut it down.
How do we do that?
Oh, I'll think of something.
You're just making this up as you go along.
Yep.
But I do it brilliantly.
MRS MOORE: That's a schematic of the old factory.
Look, cooling tunnels underneath the plant big enough to walk through.
We go under then up into the control centre.
There's another way in. Through the front door.
If they've taken Jackie for upgrading, that's how she'll get in.
We can't just go strolling up.
Well, we could, with these.
Fake Ear Pods. Dead, no signal.
But put them on, the Cybermen would mistake you for one of the crowd.
Then that’s my job.
You'd have to show no emotion, none at all. Any sign of emotion would give you away.
How many of those have you got?
Just two sets.
Okay.
If that's the best way of finding Jackie, then I'm coming with you.
Why does she matter to you?
We haven't got time.
Doctor, I'm going with him and that's that.
No stopping you, is there?
Nope.
Tell you what, we can attack the Ear Pods at the same time.
Give people their minds back so they don't walk into that place like sheep.
Jakey-boy.
Lumic’s transmitting the control signal. It must be from over there.
(BEEPING) There it is. On the zeppelin, do you see?
Great big transmitter.
Good thing Lumic likes showing off. Reckon you can take it out?
Consider it done.
Mrs Moore, would you care to accompany me into the cooling tunnels?
How could I refuse an offer of cooling tunnels?
We attack on three sides. Above, between, below.
We get to the control centre, we stop the conversion machines.
What about me?
Mickey, you can, um...
What? Stay out of trouble? Be the tin dog?
No, those days are over. I'm going with Jake.
JAKE: I don't need you, idiot.
I'm not an idiot!
You got that? I'm offering to help.
Whatever, Mickey.
Good luck.
Yeah. You, too.
Rose, I'll see you later.
Yeah, you'd better.
If we survive this, I'll see you back at the Tardis.
That's a promise.
Good luck.
It's freezing.
Any sign of a light switch?
Can't see a thing. But I've got these.
A device for every occasion.
Ooh.
Put it on.
Haven't got a hot dog in there, have you? I'm starving.
Of all the things to wish for. That's mechanically recovered meat.
I know. It's the Cyberman of food, but it's tasty.
A proper torch as well.
Let's see where we are.
Already converted, just put on ice.
Come on.
DOCTOR: Let's go slowly.
Keep an eye out for trip systems.
TANNOY: Chamber 6 now open for human upgrading.
Chamber 7 now open for human upgrading.
Chamber 8 now open for human upgrading.
Just put them on. Don't show any emotion.
No signs, nothing, okay?
Don't worry. We can do it.
We could die in there. Why are you doing this?
Let's just say I'm doing it for my mum and dad.
Right, let's go.
Chamber 8 now open for human upgrading.
Chamber 9 now open for human upgrading.
Chamber 10 now open for human upgrading.
Chamber 11 now open for human upgrading.
Two guards. We can take them.
Don't kill them.
Who put you in charge?
If you kill them, what's the difference between you and a Cyberman?
Well, I suppose we could use these.
Smelling salts?
Bit stronger than that. One of Mrs Moore's little tricks.
Should knock them out.
(WHISPERING) Three, two, one.
There's gotta be more guards on board.
Then let's go get them.
DOCTOR: How did you get into this, then? Rattling along with the Preachers?
MRS MOORE: Oh, I used to be ordinary.
Worked at Cybus Industries, 9-to-5.
Until one day, I find something I'm not supposed to.
A file on the mainframe.
ALL did was read it.
Then suddenly, I've got men with guns knocking in the middle of the night.
A life on the run.
Then I found the Preachers.
They needed a techie, so I just sat down and taught myself everything.
What about Mr Moore?
Well, he's not called Moore.
I got that from a book.
Mrs Moore.
It's safer not to use real names.
But he thinks I'm dead.
It was the only way to keep him safe.
Him and the kids.
What about you? Got any family or...
Oh, who needs family? I've got the whole world on my shoulders.
Go on, then.
What's your real name?
Angela Price.
Don't tell a soul.
Not a word.
(BEEPING) Movement in Deepcold 6.
Awaken the army.
Doctor, did that one just move?
It's just the torchlight.
Keep going, come on.
They're waking up. Run!
MRS MOORE: Get up! Quick! They're coming!
Open it! Open it!
Get up! Quick, quick!
Come on!
Oh, good team, Mrs Moore.
TANNOY: Units upgraded now 6,500.
Repeat, 6,500 and rising.
You will wait.
You okay?
No.
TANNOY: Chamber 6 now open for human upgrading.
All reject stock will be incinerated.
Any sign of Jackie?
You are Peter Tyler. Confirm. You are Peter Tyler.
Confirm.
I recognise you. I went first. My name was Jacqueline Tyler.
What?
They are un-programmed, restrain.
You're lying, you're not her. You're not my Jackie.
Now I am Cyberform. Once I was Jacqueline Tyler.
But you can't be. Not her.
Her brain is inside this body.
Jacks, I came to save you.
This man worked with Cybus Industries to create our species.
He will be rewarded, by force. Take them to Cyber Control.
They killed her. They took her and killed her.
Maybe there's a chance, I don't know. Maybe we can reverse it.
There's nothing we can do.
But if she remembers...
Where is she? Which one was it? Which one was her?
They all look the same.
Nice one, nobody's home. Find the transmitter controls, What do they look like?
I don't know.
They might have "transmitter controls" written in big red letters. Just look.
Cyberman!
It's dead.
I don't think it was ever alive.
It's empty, no brain. It's just a robot suit. It's for display.
Okay.
Transmitter.
You are not upgraded.
Yeah, well, upgrade this.
What the hell was that thing?
Electromagnetic bomb.
Takes out computers. I figured it might stop a Cyber suit.
Well, you figured right. Now, let's have a look. Know your enemy.
Got a logo on the front.
Lumic's turned them into a brand.
Heart of steel.
But look.
Is that flesh?
Hmm.
A central nervous system.
Artificially grown then threaded throughout the suit so it responds like a living thing.
Well, it is a living thing.
Oh, but look.
Emotional inhibitor. Stops them feeling anything.
But why?
It's still got a human brain. Imagine its reaction if it could see itself.
Realise itself inside this thing.
It would go insane.
So they cut out the one thing that makes them human.
Because they have to.
Why am I cold?
Oh, my God, it’s alive.
It can feel.
We broke the inhibitor. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Why so cold?
Can you remember your name?
Sally. Sally Phelan, You're a woman.
Where's Gareth?
Who's Gareth?
He can't see me.
It’s unlucky the night before.
You're getting married?
I'm cold. I'm so cold.
It's all right.
You sleep now, Sally. Just go to sleep.
Sally Phelan didn't die for nothing.
‘Cause that's the key, the emotional inhibitor.
If we could find the code behind it, the cancellation code, then feed it throughout the system into every Cyberman's head, they'd realise what they are.
And what happens then?
I think it would kill them.
Can we do that?
We've got to.
Before they kill everyone else.
There's no choice, Doctor.
It's got to be done.
No! No! You didn't have to kill her!
Sensors detect a binary vascular system.
You are an unknown upgrade. You will be taken for analysis.
The transmitter controls are sealed behind here. We need oxyacetylene or something.
Oh, and I forgot to bring it with me.
Then what do we do?
We'll crash the zeppelin.
With us inside it?
We could set it on automatic and then just leg it.
Let's have a look.
It's locked. There's got to be an override.
Let me have a go. I'm good with computers. Trust me.
I've been captured but don't worry, Rose and Pete are still out there.
They can rescue me. Oh, well, never mind. You okay?
Yeah.
But they got Jackie.
We were too late. Lumic killed her.
And where is he? The famous Mr Lumic?
Don't we get the chance to meet our lord and master?
He has been upgraded.
~So he's just like you?
He is superior.
The Lumic unit has been designated Cyber controller.
This is the Age of Steel and I am its creator.
I'm almost there.
Not bad work.
It's moving!
You said it was dead!
A robot suit's still a good robot. Wait a minute.
Hey, Cyberman. Over here.
Come on, you brainless lump of metal.
Come and have a go.
(LOUD BEEPING) WOMAN: Oh, no!
The transmitter is down!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) That's my friends at work. Good boys.
Mr Lumic, I think that's a vote for free will.
I have factories waiting on seven continents.
If the Ear Pods have failed, then the Cybermen will take humanity by force.
London has fallen, so shall the world.
Hold on, I've logged on to Cyber Control. They're alive.
The Doctor and Rose. There they are.
Never mind them, what the hell is that thing?
Shh! Has this thing got sound?
I will bring peace to the world.
Everlasting peace and unity and uniformity.
And imagination? What about that? The one thing that led you here.
Imagination, you're killing it dead.
What is your name?
I'm the Doctor.
A redundant title. Doctors need not exist.
Cybermen never sicken, Yeah, but that's it. That's exactly the point.
Oh, Lumic, you're a clever man. I'd call you a genius except I'm in the room.
But everything you've invented, you did to fight your sickness, and that's brilliant, that is so human.
But once you get rid of sickness and mortality, then what's there to strive for, eh?
The Cybermen won't advance.
You'll just stop.
You'll stay like this forever.
A metal Earth with metal men and metal thoughts, lacking the one thing that makes this planet so alive. People!
Ordinary, stupid, brilliant people.
You are proud of your emotions?
Oh, yes.
Then tell me, Doctor, have you known grief and rage and pain?
Yes. Yes, I have.
And they hurt?
Oh, yes.
I can set you free. Would you not want that?
A life without pain?
You might as well kill me.
Then I take that option.
It's not yours to take.
You're a Cyber controller.
You don't control me or anything with blood in its heart.
You have no means of stopping me.
I have an army. A species of my own.
You just don't get it, do you? An army's nothing.
‘Cause those ordinary people, they're the key. The most ordinary person can change the world.
Some ordinary man or woman, some idiot.
All it takes is for him to find, say, the right numbers, say, the right code, say, for example, the code behind the emotional inhibitor.
The code right in front of him.
‘Cause even an idiot knows his computers these days.
Knows how to get past firewalls and passwords.
Knows how to find something encrypted in the Lumic family database under, what was it, Pete? Binary what?
Binary 9.
Binary 9.
An idiot could find that code. A cancellation code.
And he'd keep on typing, keep on fighting, anything to save his friends.
Your words are irrelevant.
Talk too much, that’s my problem.
Lucky I got you that cheap tariff, Rose, for all our long chats on your phone.
The phone.
You will be deleted.
Yes. Delete. Control. Hash. All those lovely buttons.
Then, of course, my particular favourite. Send.
And let's not forget how you seduced all those ordinary people in the first place, by making every bit of technology compatible with everything else.
It's for you.
Like this.
(SCREAMING) Yes!
(ALARM BLARING) (MOANING) I'm sorry.
What have you done?
I gave them back their souls.
They can see what you've done, Lumic, and it's killing them.
Delete! Delete!
Delete!
(LUMIC SCREAMING) There's no way out.
What are you doing?
We've got to get away.
If that factory blows up, this balloon's gonna ignite.
Take it back!
Mickey, they've had it.
I said take it back!
We're not leaving them behind.
There's no way we're leaving them behind.
Hold it.
Rose? Rose, can you hear me? Head for the roof.
It's Mickey. He says head for the roof.
(GROANING) No!
Mickey, where did you learn to fly that thing?
PlayStation. Just hold on, Rose. I'm coming to get you.
You can't go any lower.
I've got to, man.
You're gonna crush them.
There's gotta be something, there's got to be.
Oh, yes.
You've got to be kidding.
Rose, get on!
Hold on tight, we're going up.
Welcome to Mickey Smith Airlines. Please enjoy your flight.
(WHOOPING) We did it! Mickey did it!
Pete! Take this!
Use it!
Hold the button down. Press it against the rope. Just do it!
Jackie Tyler. This is for her.
(SCREAMING) So what happens inside that thing, then?
Do you want to see?
I don't think so.
But you two, you know, all that stuff you said about different worlds.
Who are you?
It's like you said.
Imagine there are different worlds.
Parallel worlds, Worlds with another Pete Tyler and Jackie Tyler is still alive.
And their daughter.
I've got to go.
But if you just look inside...
I can't. There's all those Lumic factories out there, all those Cybermen still in storage.
Someone's got to tell the authorities what happened.
Carry on the fight.
Rose.
I've only got five minutes of power.
We've got to go.
The Doctor could show you how.
Thank you for everything.
Dad...
Don't. Just don't.
MICKEY: Here it is.
I found it. Not a crease.
My suit. Good man.
Now then, Jake, we've got to run, but one more thing.
Mrs Moore, her real name was Angela Price.
She's got a husband out there and children. Find them.
Tell them how she died saving the world.
Yeah, course I will.
Off we go, then.
Erm...
Thing is, I'm staying.
You're doing what?
You can't.
It sort of balances out ‘cause this world lost its Ricky, but there's me.
And there's work to be done with all those Cybermen still out there.
But you can't stay.
Rose, my gran‘s here.
She's still alive. My old gran, remember her?
Yeah.
She needs me.
What about me? What if I need you?
Yeah, but Rose, you don't.
It's just you and him, isn’t it?
We had something a long time ago, but not anymore.
Well, we'll come back.
We can travel anywhere. Come and see you, yeah?
We can't.
I told you, travel between parallel worlds is impossible.
We only got here by accident.
We fell through a crack in time. When we leave, I've got to close it.
We can't ever return.
Doctor.
Take Rose's phone. It's got the code. Get it out there.
Stop those factories.
Good luck.
Mickey the idiot.
Watch it.
Thanks.
We've had a laugh, though, haven't we?
Seen it all, been there and back.
Who'd have thought, me and you, off that old estate, flying through the stars.
All those years, just sitting there...
imagining what we'd do one day.
We never saw this, did we?
Go on. Don't miss your flight.
Jake, you want to watch this.
JAKE: What the hell?
MICKEY: That's the Doctor in the Tardis, With Rose Tyler.
(WHOOSHING) You're alive. Oh, Mum, you're alive.
Well, I was the last time I looked.
What is it? What's happened, sweetheart?
What's wrong? Where did you go?
Far away.
That was far away.
Where's Mickey?
He's gone home.
I know it's not easy with my face looking exactly like Ricky, but I'm a different man, I'm not replacing him.
But we can remember him by fighting in his name.
With all those cyber factories out there, do you think there'd be one in Paris?
Yeah.
Then let's go and liberate Paris.
What, you and me? In a van?
There's nothing wrong with a van.
I once saved the universe with a big yellow truck.
There you go, sir. All wired up for the great occasion.

WOMAN: (ON TV) Orchestrations were arranged by Sir Rhodri Fenning and Dame Evelyn Blish is a member of the Kings Lynn players.
So tune in again next week for more from the What's My Line? team.
And that brings us to the end of programming for today.
So, from all of us here at Alexandra Palace, a very good night.
£200 overdrawn.
I need a miracle.
(PEOPLE LAUGHING) (RAIN PATTERING) (CHATTER ON THE RADIO) He's a caution, that one. He does make me laugh.
Oh, our lord and master.
Rita, I'm off out.
Dad.
Oh, how many times, son? We'll see.
But everyone's getting a telly, Dad, even Mr Gallagher.
And the Bells at number 67.
Well, perhaps we'll get one for the Coronation.
If you're lucky. We'll see.
Don't wait up.
I heard they rot your brains. Rot them into soup and your brain comes pouring out of your ears.
That's what television does.
Mr Magpie?
Oh 1, Mr Magpie?
Eh?
Whoo-hoo! Can you hear me, Magpie? “Yes.
I must be dreaming.
Oh, no. This isn't a dream.
I'm going doolally, then.
Not at all, sweetheart.
Now, are you sitting comfortably?
Good, then we'll begin.
(WOMAN LAUGHING) (MAGPIE GROANING) (DOCTOR WHO THEME) I thought we'd be going for the Vegas era.
You know, the white flares and the chest hair.
You are kidding, aren't you?
If you wanna see Elvis, you go for the late '50s.
The time before burgers!
When they called him "The Pelvis" and he still had a waist!
What's more, you see him in style!
(IMITATING ELVIS) You going my way, doll?
Is there any other way to go, daddy-o? Straight from the fridge, man!
Hey, you speak the lingo!
Yeah, well, me and Mum, Cliff Richard movies every Bank Holiday Monday.
Cliff! I knew your mother would be a Cliff fan.
Where we off to?
Ed Sullivan TV studios, Elvis did Hound Dog on one of the shows. There were loads of complaints.
Bit of luck, we'll just catch it.
And that would be the TV studios in, what, New York?
That's the one!
(ROSE LAUGHING) Digging that New York vibe!
Well, this could still be New York. I mean, this looks very New York to me.
London-y New York, mind, but...
What are all the flags for?
(MUFFIN THE MULE THEME ON TV) Smashing! Smashing, innit?
You'd have thought they was in the room with ya, eh?
Fair do's, Tommy, you had a point. New television.
There, that should cheer you up a bit, Rita? Give us a smile, then, eh?
I can't. Nothing's the same anymore. Not with her...
Stop going on about it!
But her face, Eddie.
What happened to her? That awful face.
I said stop it!
(THUMPING) She's awake. I think she's hungry.
There you go, sir. All wired up for the great occasion.
Great occasion? What do you mean?
Where you been living, out in the colonies?
The Coronation of course!
And what Coronation's that, then?
What do you mean? The Coronation!
It's the Queen's! Queen Elizabeth!
Oh! Is this 1953?
Last time I looked.
Time for a lovely bit of pomp and circumstance. What we do best.
Look at all the TV aerials. Looks like everyone's got one.
That's weird. My mum said tellies were so rare, they all had to pile into one house.
Not round here, love. Magpie's Marvellous Tellies.
Only five quid a pop!
Oh, but this is a brilliant year, classic!
Technicolor! Everest climbed! Everything off the ration!
A nation throwing off the shackles of war and looking forward to a happier, brighter future!
WOMAN: Someone help me, please! Ted!
Leave him alone! That's my husband!
WOMAN: Please!
What's going on?
Oi! What are you doing?
Police business. Get out of the way, sir.
Who did they take? Do you know him?
Must be Mr Gallagher.
It's happening all over the place. They're turning into monsters.
Tommy! Not one word. Get inside now!
Sorry, I'd better do as he says.
DOCTOR: All aboard!
Operation Market Stall. Go! Go! Go!
Lost them. How did they get away from us?
I'm surprised they didn't turn back and arrest you for reckless driving.
Have you actually passed your test?
Men in black? Vanishing police cars?
This is Churchill's England, not Stalin's Russia.
Monsters, that boy said.
Maybe we should go and ask the neighbours.
That's what I like about you, the domestic approach.
Thank you.
Hold on. Was that an insult?
MAGPIE: I've finished it as you instructed.
That's awfully good of you, Mr Magpie.
So you'll go soon?
You'll leave me?
We'll see.
If you're a very good boy.
Please. You're burning me. Inside.
Behind my eyes. It hurts.
Even my memories hurt.
I just want things back like they used to be.
Oh, but this world of yours is busy, busy, busy, forging ahead into a brand-new age.
You can never go back. That’s your tragedy.
But now the time is almost ripe, Magpie.
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.
Or lady.
(STAIRS CREAKING) (THUDDING) Gran? Gran, it's me. It's Tommy.
I'm gonna come in, Gran.
Stand back. Just don't...
I'm sorry, but I've got to come in.
What do you think you're doing?
We gotta try and help her, Dad.
Give me that key.
I said give me that key right now.
And don't think I've finished with you.
All the warnings I've given you and every time, every time, you disobey me.
We can't just lock her away.
Excuse me, sunshine, I am talking.
And you can forget that college nonsense.
You're gonna come and work alongside me.
Get your hands dirty for once.
(THUDDING) Oh, Lord! Won't she ever stop?
There, there, Rita, my sweet. Business as usual.
Now, let's get these up all over the house in honour of Her Majesty.
But, Eddie, what if she's dying?
I am talking!
(SCOOTER ENGINE HUMMING) That's better.
A little bit of hush.
(DOORBELL RINGING) Hi! Hi!
Who are you, then?
Let's see, judging by the look of you, family man, nice house, decent wage, fought in the war, therefore, I represent Queen and country!
Just doing a check of her forthcoming Majesty's subjects before the great day.
Don't mind if we come in? No, I didn’t think you did. Thank you.
Not bad, very nice, very well kept.
I'd like to congratulate you, Mrs...?
Connolly.
Now then, Rita. I can handle this.
This gentleman's a proper representative. Don't mind the wife. She rattles on a bit.
Well, maybe she should rattle on a bit more.
I'm not convinced you're doing your patriotic duty.
Those flags, why are they not flying?
There we are, Rita, I told you. Get them up. Queen and country.
I'm sorry.
Get it done. Do it now.
Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute.
Like the gentleman says...
You've got hands, Mr Connolly. Two big hands.
Then why is that your wife's job?
Well, it's housework, innit?
And that's a woman's job? ~Course it is.
Mr Connolly, what gender is the Queen?
She's a female.
And are you suggesting the Queen does the housework?
No, not at all.
Then get busy!
Right. Yes, sir.
You'll be proud of us, sir! We'll have Union Jacks left, right and centre!
Excuse me, Mr Connolly. Hang on a minute. Union Jacks?
Yes, that's right, isn’t it?
That's the Union flag.
It's the Union Jack only when it's flown at sea.
Oh, I'm sorry. I do apologise.
Well, don't get it wrong again. There's a good man. Now get to it!
Right, then, nice and comfy. At her Majesty's leisure!
Union flag?
Mum went out with a sailor.
(CHUCKLING) I bet she did.
Anyway, I'm the Doctor and this is Rose. And you are?
Tommy.
Well, sit yourself down, Tommy.
Have a look at this. I love telly, don't you?
Yeah, I think it's brilliant.
Good man.
Keep working, Mr C!
Now, why don't you tell me what's wrong?
Did you say you were a doctor?
Yes, I am.
Can you help her? Oh, please. Can you help her, Doctor?
Now then, Rita, I don't think the gentleman needs to know.
Oh, the gentleman does.
Tell us what's wrong, and we can help.
It's all right. It's all right. Come here.
Oh, its okay. It’s all right.
Hold on a minute.
Queen and Country's one thing, but this is my house.
What the... What the hell am I doing?
Now you listen here, Doctor. You may have fancy qualifications, but what goes on under my roof is my business.
Not if people are being bundled into...
I am talking!
And I'm not listening!
Now you, Mr Connolly, you are staring into a deep, dark pit of trouble if you don't let me help.
So I'm ordering you, sir, tell me what's going on!
(THUDDING) She won't stop.
(THUDDING CONTINUES) She never stops.
We started hearing stories, all round the place.
People who have changed.
Families keeping it secret ‘cause they were scared.
Then the police started finding out. We don't know how, no one does.
They just turn up. They come to the door and take them.
Any time of the day or night.
Show me.
(DOOR CREAKING) Gran, it's Tommy.
It's all right, Gran. I've brought help.
(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING) Her face has completely gone.
Scarcely an electrical impulse left.
Almost complete neural shutdown. It's just ticking over.
It's like her brain's been wiped clean.
What are we gonna do, Doctor? We can't even feed her.
We've got company!
It's them. They've come for her!
What was she doing before this happened? Where was she?
Tell me, quickly, think!
I can't think. She doesn't leave the house.
She was just...
Hold on a minute!
There are three important, brilliant and complicated reasons why you should listen to me.
One...
Doctor!
Leave her alone. You'll hurt her! Mum!
Come back. Don't hurt her.
Back inside, Rita.
She's my mother!
Back inside now, I said!
(CRYING) Hell of a right hook. Have to watch out for that.
Don't fight it. Back inside.
Rose, come on!
EDDIE: Get back inside.
TOMMY: But they took her. EDDIE: Don't fight it.
Rose! We're gonna lose them again!
But they took her! That was Gran and they took her!
EDDIE: Come on, back inside, lad.
TOMMY: How did they know? How did they find her? Who told them?
You! Get the hell out of my house!
I'm going. I'm done. Nice to meet you, Tommy.
Mrs Connolly.
And as for you, Mr Connolly, only an idiot hangs the Union flag upside down.
Shame on you.
Oh, very good.
Very good.
Stay where you are!
I'm sorry, miss. I'm afraid you're too late. I was just about to lock the door.
Yeah? Well, I wanna buy a telly.
Come back tomorrow, please.
You'll be closed, won't you?
What?
For the big day?
The Coronation?
Yes, yes, of course. The big day.
I'm sure you'll find somewhere to watch it. Please go.
Seems to me half of London's got a television, since you're practically giving them away.
I have my reasons.
And what are they?
(STATIC) Hungry!
Hungry!
What's that?
It's just the television.
One of these modern programmes.
Now, I really do think you should leave right now.
Not until you've answered my questions. How comes your televisions are so cheap?
It's my patriotic duty.
Seems only right that as many folk as possible get to watch the Coronation.
We may be losing the Empire, but we can still be proud!
Twenty million people they reckon will be watching.
Imagine that. And 20 million people can’t be wrong, eh?
So why don't you get yourself back home and get up bright and early for the big day?
No, I'm not leaving till I've seen everything.
I need to close.
Mr Magpie, something's happening out there.
Ordinary people are being struck down and changed and the only new thing in the house is a television.
Your television. What's going on?
I knew this would happen.
I knew I'd be found out.
Alright, then, just you and me.
You gonna come clean, then? What's really in it for you?
For me? Perhaps some peace.
From what?
From her.
Well, that's just a woman on the telly. That's just a programme.
What a pretty little girl.
Oh, my God. Are you talking to me?
Yes.
I'm talking to you, little one.
Unseasonably chilly for the time of year, don't you think?
What are you?
I'm The Wire.
And I'm hungry!
Magpie, help me!
Just think of that audience tomorrow, my dear, all settling down to watch the Coronation.
Twenty million people. Things will never be the same again.
I'm sorry. So sorry.
Help me!
Good night, children, everywhere.
Start from the beginning. Tell me everything you know.
Well, for starters, I know you can't wrap your hand round your elbow and make your fingers meet.
Don't get clever with me.
You were there today at Florizel Street, and now breaking into this establishment.
Oh, you're connected with this. Make no mistake.
Well, the thing is, Detective Inspector Bishop...
How do you know my name?
It's written inside your collar.
Bless your mum. But I can’t help thinking, Detective Inspector, you're not exactly doing much detective-inspecting, are you?
I'm doing everything in my power.
All you're doing is grabbing those faceless people and hiding them as fast as you can.
Don't tell me, orders from above.
Coronation Day, the eyes of the world are on London Town, so any sort of problem just gets swept out of sight.
The nation has an image to maintain.
But doesn't it drive you mad, doing nothing?
Don't you want to get out there and investigate?
Course I do, But...
with all the crowds expected, we haven't got the manpower.
Even if we did, this is beyond anything we've ever seen.
I just don't know anymore.
Twenty years on the force, I don't even know where to start.
We haven't the faintest clue what's going on.
Well, that could change.
How?
Start from the beginning. Tell me everything you know.
We started finding them about a month ago.
Persons left sans visage.
Heads just... blank.
Is there any sort of pattern?
It's spreading out from North London, all over the city. Men, women, kids, grannies.
Only real lead is there's been quite a large number in...
Florizel Street.
Found another one, sir.
Oh, good man, Crabtree. Here we are, Doctor.
Take a good look.
See what you can deduce.
Rose.
You know her?
Know her? She...
They found her in the street apparently, down by Damascus Road. Just abandoned.
That's unusual. That's the first one out in the open... (FADES OUT) .. We'll have Torchwood on our backs then, make no mistake.
They did what?
I'm sorry?
They left her where?
Just... in the street.
In the street. They left her in the street.
They took her face and just chucked her out and left her in the street.
And, as a result, that makes things...
simple, very, very simple.
Do you know why?
No.
Because now, Detective Inspector Bishop, there is no power on this Earth that can stop me! Come on!
The big day dawns.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING) (DOOR CLOSING) You've had your fun with your little Doctor.
But now you're left with me, Rita, so you'll behave yourself.
And smile.
Here we go, everyone, here we go!
Grub's up. Grub's up. Tuck in, everyone. Tuck in. Take a sandwich.
Oh, here we go, it's starting. Look, look. Go and take your places.
Sit down. Sit down. There we are.
MAN: (ON TV) ... in front of the palace...
WOMAN: Rita, love, just look at that telly-box, then! Innit marvellous?
The picture's so clear!
Here, Bet, I says to Rita, I says, “You didn't need to get your hair done special, love.
“The Queen won't be able to see you!" Where's your old mum, then? She can't go missing it.
Sorry, Mum can't make it down.
Aw, bless her.
Maybe we could pop up and see her later.
Maybe you could. It's a good idea. What do you think, Dad?
Maybe Aunty Betty can go and see Gran later.
Oh, he loves his Gran, this one.
Proper little mummy's boy all round.
Oh, you know what they say about them.
Eddie, you want to beat that out of him.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
(DOORBELL RINGING) I'll get it.
.. Will first appear in about 10 minutes’ time riding in the gold coach of state.
Tommy, talk to me.
I need to know exactly what happened inside your house.
What the blazes do you think you're doing?
I wanna help, Dad!
Mr Connolly.
Shut your face, you.
Whoever you are. We can handle this ourselves!
Listen, you little twerp.
You're hardly out of the blooming cradle so I don't expect you to understand, but I've got a position to maintain.
People round here respect me.
It matters what people think.
Is that why you did it, Dad?
What do you mean? Did what?
You ratted on Gran.
How else would the police know where to look?
Unless some coward told them.
How dare you?
You think I fought a war just so a mouthy little scum like you could call me a coward!
You don't get it, do you? You fought against fascism, remember?
People telling you how to live. Who you could be friends with.
Who you could fall in love with. Who could live and who had to die.
Don't you get it? You were fighting so that little twerps like me could do what we want, say what we want.
Now you've become just like them.
You've been informing on everyone, haven't you?
Even Gran. All to protect your precious reputation!
Eddie, is that true?
I did it for us, Rita.
She was filthy! A filthy disgusting thing!
She's my mother.
All the others you informed on, all the people in our street, our friends.
Thad to.
I did the right thing.
The right thing for us or for you, Eddie?
You go, Tommy.
Go with the Doctor and do some good.
Get away from this house. It's poison.
We've had a ruddy monster under our roof all right, but it weren't my mother!
EDDIE: Rita!
Tommy.
What was all that, then?
That was...
That was the sound of something ending.
And about time, too. Everyone all right?
Smashing.
Nothing's gonna spoil our big day, is it?
Tommy, tell me about that night, the night she changed.
She was just watching the telly.
Rose said it. She guessed it straightaway. Of course she did, All these aerials in one little street. How come?
Bloke up the road, Mr Magpie, he's selling them cheap.
Is he, now?
Come on!
BISHOP: Here! You can't do that.
Shop!
If you're here, come out and talk to me, Magpie!
Maybe he's out.
Looks like it.
Oh, hello.
This isn't right. This is very much not right.
Tastes like iron. Bakelite, Knocked together with human hands, yes, but the design itself...
Oh, beautiful work. That is so simple.
That's incredible. It's like a television, but portable.
A portable television!
It's not the only power source in this room.
TOMMY: Gran.
I'm on my way.
What do you think you're doing?
I want my friend restored and I think that's beyond a little backstreet electrician, so tell me, who's really in charge here?
Yoo-hoo. I think that must be me.
Oh, this one’s smart as paint.
Is she talking to us?
I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'm afraid you've brought this on yourselves.
May I introduce you to my new friend.
Jolly nice to meet you.
Oh, my God, it's her. That woman off the telly!
No. It's just using her image.
What?
What are you?
I'm The Wire.
And I will gobble you up, pretty boy.
Every last morsel!
And when I have feasted, I shall regain the corporeal body, which my fellow kind denied me.
Good Lord. Colour television.
~So your own people tried to stop you?
They executed me, but I escaped in this form and fled across the stars.
And now you're trapped in the television.
Not for much longer.
Doctor, is this what got my gran?
Yes, Tommy. It feeds off the electrical activity of the brain, but it gorges itself like a great, over-fed pig.
Taking people's faces, their essence as it stuffs itself.
And you let her do it, Magpie. Thad to.
She allowed me my face.
She's promised to release me at the time of manifestation.
What does that mean?
The appointed time.
My crowning glory.
Doctor, the Coronation!
For the first time in history, millions gathered round a television set.
But you're not strong enough yet, are you?
You can't do it all from here.
That's why you need this.
You need something more powerful.
This will turn a big transmitter into a big receiver.
What a clever thing you are.
But why fret about it? Why not just relax?
Kick off your shoes and enjoy the Coronation.
Believe me, you'll be glued to the screen.
Doctor!
Hold on.
Hungry!
Hungry.
The Wire is hungry! Oh, this one is tasty!
Of, I'll have lashings of him. Delicious!
All Armed?
He's armed and clever. Withdraw! Withdraw!
The box, Magpie, the box!
Hold tight!
Conduct me to my victory, Magpie.
Hungry! Hungry!
Feed me!
Oh, she's so lovely!
RITA: Beautiful.
Makes you forget all your troubles.
Everyone all right for pop?
Tommy, wake up! Tommy, come on!
What happened?
Where's Magpie?
We don't even know where to start looking. It's too late.
Never too late, as a wise person once said.
Kylie, I think. The Wire's got big plans.
It'll need... Oh, yes, yes. She's gonna harvest half the population.
Millions and millions of people. And where are we?
Muswell Hill.
Muswell Hill. Muswell Hill! Which means...
Alexandra Palace!
Biggest TV transmitter in North London. Oh!
What's why it chose this place, Tommy!
What are you gonna do?
I'm going shopping.
This what you want?
Perfect! Right, I need one more thing.
(TYRES SCREECHING) Got it. Let's go.
Her Majesty is wearing...
I can't do this!
Please! Please, don't make me.
The time is at hand. Feed me!
Feed me!
There!
Come on!
Wait, wait, wait. Where do we think we... Oh, I'm very sorry, sir.
Shouldn’t you be at the Coronation?
They're saving me a seat.
Who'd he think you were?
King of Belgium apparently.
(CROWD CHEERING ON TV) WOMAN: (ON TV) ... will wait there a while.
But he will go on ahead of Her Majesty into the Abbey...
Keep this switched on.
Don't let anyone stop you, Tommy. Everything depends on it, you understand?
MAN: (ON TV) Her Majesty moves across...
You'll get yourself killed up there! Your Majesty!
Feed me!
(LAUGHING) Ah! Feast!
Feasting! The Wire is feasting!
It's too late. It's too late for all of us!
I shall consume you, Doctor!
I won't let you do this, Magpie!
Help me, Doctor! It burns!
It took my face, my soul!
You cannot stop The Wire. Soon, I shall become manifest.
(DOCTOR SCREAMING) No more. No more of this. You promised me peace.
Then peace you shall have.
(MAGPIE SCREAMING) Been burning the candle at both ends?
You've over-extended yourself, missus.
You shouldn't have had a crack at poor old Magpie there.
(EXCLAIMING) Rubber soles, swear by them.
Of, dear. Has our little plan gone horribly wrong, Doctor?
... coat of shimmering cloth of gold lined with a crimson silk...
(ON TV) ... are you willing to do the same?
No!
It's closed down, I'm afraid, and no epilogue.
(THE WIRE SCREAMING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (GOD SAVE THE QUEEN PLAYING ON TV) What have I missed?
Doctor! What happened?
Sorted. Electrical creature. TV technology.
Clever alien life form.
That's me, by the way. I turned the receiver back into a transmitter and I trapped The Wire in here.
I just invented the home video 30 years early.
Betamax.
Oh, look!
God save the Queen, eh?
(PEOPLE CHEERING ON TV) Here's my grandson. Oh, son! Oh, my goodness.
This was never your house. It's in my mother's name.
And on her behalf, I'm telling you, out.
(DOOR CLOSING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) We could go down the Mall, join in with the crowds.
No, that's just pomp and circumstance.
This is history, right here.
The domestic approach?
DOCTOR: Exactly.
Will it... That thing... is it trapped for good on the video?
Hope so.
Just to be on the safe side, though, I'll use my unrivalled knowledge of trans-temporal extirpation methods to neutralise the residual electronic pattern.
You what?
I'm going to tape over it.
Just leave it to me. I'm always doing that.
Tell you what, Tommy. You can have the scooter. Little present.
Best keep it in the garage for a few years, though, eh?
Good riddance, Is that it, then, Tommy?
New monarch, new age, new world.
No room for a man like Eddie Connolly. “That's right.
He deserves it.
Tommy, go after him.
What for?
He's your dad.
He's an idiot.
Course he is. Like I said, he's your dad.
But you're clever, clever enough to save the world so don't stop there.
Go on.
We've gone beyond the reach of the Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(WHOOSHING) I wonder what's wrong with her. She's sort of queasy.
Indigestion. Like she didn't want to land.
If you think there's gonna be trouble, we could always get back inside and go somewhere else.
I think we've landed inside a cupboard. Here we go.
Open door 15.
Some sort of base, Moon base, sea base, space base. They build these things out of kits.
Glad we're indoors. Sounds like a storm out there, Open door 16.
Human design, you've got a thing about kits.
This place was put together like a flat-pack wardrobe, only bigger and easier.
Open door 17.
Oh, it's a sanctuary base!
Close door 17.
Deep-space exploration.
We've gone way out. And listen to that.
(HUMMING) Underneath. Someone's drilling.
"Welcome to hell.” Oh, it's not that bad.
No, over there.
Hold on.
What does that say?
That's weird, It won't translate.
But I thought the Tardis translated everything, writing as well.
I should see English.
Exactly.
Now if that's not working, then it means...
this writing is old.
Very old.
Impossibly old.
We should find out who's in charge.
We've gone beyond the reach of the Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move.
And if someone's looking for...
Open door 19.
Right, hello. Sorry.
I was just saying, nice place.
We must feed.
You gotta what?
We must feed.
Yeah, I think they mean us.
We must feed.
We must feed.
We must feed.
We must feed.
We must feed.
We must feed. We must feed.
We must feed. We must feed.
We must feed. We must feed.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) We must feed...
you, if you are hungry.
Sorry?
We apologise.
Electromagnetics have interfered with speech systems.
Would you like some refreshment?
Open door 18. “Um...
What the hell?
How did...
Captain, you're not gonna believe this. We've got people.
Out of nowhere. I mean, real people. I mean...
Two living people just standing here right in front of me.
(ON RADIO) Don't be stupid, that’s impossible, I suggest telling them that.
But you're a sort of space base.
You must have visitors now and then. It can't be that impossible.
You telling me you don't know where you are?
No idea. More fun that way.
(ON PA) Stand by, everyone. Buckle down, We have incoming, and it's a big one.
Quake 0.5 on its way.
(ALARMS BLARING) Through here. Now. Quickly, come on! Move!
Move it! Come on!
Keep moving! Come on! Keep moving!
Oh, my God, you meant it.
People! Look at that, real people.
That's us. Hurray!
Yeah, definitely real. My name's Rose, Rose Tyler, and this is the Doctor.
Come on, the oxygen must be offline. We're hallucinating, they can't be...
No, they're real.
Come on, we're in the middle of an alert.
Danny, strap up, the quake's coming in. Impact in 30 seconds.
Sorry, you two, whoever you are, just hold on. Tight.
Hold on to what?
Anything, I don’t care, just hold on.
Ood, are we fixed?
Your kindness in this emergency is much appreciated.
What's this planet called anyway?
Don't be stupid. It hasn't got a name.
How could it have a name?
You really don't know, do you?
And impact!
Oh, well. That wasn't so bad...
Okay, that's it. Everyone all right?
Speak to me! Ida?
Yeah.
Danny?
I'm fine.
Toby?
Fine.
Scooti?
No damage.
Jefferson?
Check!
We're fine, thanks, fine. Yeah, don't worry about us.
Surface caved in. I deflected it onto Storage 5 through 8.
We've lost them completely.
Toby, go and check the rocket link.
That's not my department.
Just do as I say, yeah?
IDA: Oxygen holding. Internal gravity at 56.6.
We should be okay.
Never mind the earthquake, that's...
That's one hell of a storm. What is that, a hurricane?
You need an atmosphere for a hurricane. There's no air out there.
It's a complete vacuum.
Then what's shaking the roof?
You're not joking. You really don't know.
Well, introductions.
FYI, as they said in the olden days.
I'm Ida Scott, Science Officer.
Zachary Cross Flane, Acting Captain, sir.
You've met Mr Jefferson, he's Head of Security.
Danny Bartock, Ethics Committee.
Not as boring as it sounds.
And that man who just left, that was Toby Zed, Archaeology, and this...
is Scooti Manista, Trainee Maintenance.
And this...
This is home.
Brace yourselves.
The sight of it sends some people mad.
That's a black hole.
But that's impossible.
I did warn you.
We're standing under a black hole.
In orbit.
We can't be.
IDA: You can see for yourself. We're in orbit.
But we can't be, This lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit around that black hole, without falling in.
Discuss.
And that's bad, yeah?
Bad doesn't cover it. A black hole's a dead star.
It collapses in on itself, in and in and in, until the matter's so dense and tight, it starts to pull everything else in, too.
Nothing in the universe can escape it.
Light, gravity, time, everything just gets pulled inside and crushed.
So they can't be in orbit?
We should be pulled right in.
We should be dead.
And yet, here we are.
Beyond the laws of physics.
Welcome onboard.
But if there's no atmosphere out there, what's that?
IDA: Stars breaking up. Gas clouds.
We have whole solar systems being ripped apart above our heads, before falling into that thing.
So, a bit worse than a storm, then.
Just a bit.
Just a bit, yeah.
VOICE: (WHISPERING) Toby.
Who's that?
Danny?
Close door 1.
The rocket links fine.
That's the black hole, officially designated K37 Gem 5.
In the scriptures of the Veltino, this planet is called Krop Tor, the bitter pill.
And the black hole is supposed to be a mighty demon who was tricked into devouring the planet only to spit it out because it was poison.
The bitter pill. I like that.
We are so far out.
Lost in the drifts of the universe. How did you even get here?
We flew in. You see...
this planet's generating a gravity field.
We don't know how, we've no idea, but it's kept in constant balance against the black hole.
And the field extends out there as a funnel, a distinct gravity funnel reaching out into clear space.
That was our way in.
You flew down that thing? Like a rollercoaster.
By rights, the ship should've been torn apart.
We lost the captain, which is what put me in charge.
And you're doing a good job.
Yeah, well. Needs must.
But if that gravity funnel closes, there's no way out.
Oh, we have fun speculating about that.
Oh, yeah. That's the word, “fun”.
But that field would take phenomenal amounts of power, I mean...
Not just big, but off the scale. Can I...?
Sure, help yourself.
Your refreshment.
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.
I'm sorry, what was your name?
We have no titles, We are as one.
Erm, what are they called?
Oh, come on. Where have you been living? Everyone's got one.
Well, not me. So, what are they?
They're the Ood. The Ood?
The Ood.
Well, that's Ood.
Very Ood. But handy.
They work the mine shaft, all the drilling and stuff.
Supervision and maintenance.
They're born for it. Basic slave race.
You've got slaves?
Don't start. She's like one of that lot, Friends of the Ood.
Well, maybe I am, yeah. Since when do humans need slaves?
But the Ood offer themselves, If you don't give them orders, they just pine away and die.
Seriously? You like being ordered about?
It is all we crave, Why is that, then?
We have nothing else in life.
Yeah, well, I used to think like that.
Long time ago.
DOCTOR: There we go. Do you see?
To generate that gravity field and the funnel, you'd need a power source with an inverted self-extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds.
That's all the sixes.
And it's impossible.
It took us two years to work that out.
I'm very good.
But that's why we're here.
This power source is ten miles below, through solid rock.
Point 0. We're drilling down to try and find it.
It's giving off readings of over 90 Statts on the Blazen Scale.
It could revolutionise modern science.
We could use it to fuel the empire.
Or start a war.
It's buried beneath us. In the darkness, waiting.
What's your job? Chief dramatist?
Well, whatever it is down there, it's not a natural phenomenon.
This planet once supported life, aeons ago, before the human race had even learnt to walk.
I saw that lettering written on the wall, did you do that?
I copied it from fragments we found unearthed by the drilling, but I can't translate it.
No, neither can I. And that's saying something.
And there was some form of civilisation.
They buried something.
Now, it's reaching out.
Calling us in.
And you came.
How could we not?
So, when it comes right down to it, why did you come here?
Why did you do that? Why? I'll tell you why.
Because it was there. Brilliant!
Excuse me. Zack, wasn't it? That's me.
Just stand there ‘cause I'm gonna hug you, is that all right?
Suppose so.
Here we go. Coming in.
Human beings. You are amazing.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
Not at all.
But apart from that, you're completely mad.
You should pack your bags, get back on that ship and fly for your lives.
You can talk. How the hell did you get here?
Oh, I've got this... This ship... It's hard to explain, it just sort of appears.
We can show you, we parked down the corridor from...
What's it called? Habitation Area 3? 3.
Do you mean Storage 6?
It was a bit of a cupboard, yeah.
Storage 6? But you said...
You said...
You said Storage 5 to 8.
What is it? What's wrong?
Open door 19.
Close door 19.
Doors, come on!
Open door 17.
Open door 15.
Open door 16.
It can't be, it can't be!
What's wrong? What is it?
Doctor, the Tardis is in there. What's happened?
The Tardis is gone.
Door 16 out of commission.
The earthquake. This section collapsed.
But it's got to be out there somewhere.
Look down.
The ground gave way. My Tardis must have fallen down into the heart of the planet.
You've got robot drills heading the same way.
We can't divert the drilling.
But I need my ship! It's all I've got. Literally, the only thing.
Doctor, we've only got the resources to dig one central shaft down to the power source and that's it.
No diversions, no distractions, no exceptions.
Your machine is lost.
All can do is offer you a lift, if we ever get to leave this place.
And that is the end of it.
I'll put you on the duty roster.
We need someone in the laundry.
Open door 1.
Close door 1.
I've trapped you here.
No, don't worry about me.
(RUMBLING) Okay, we're on a planet that shouldn't exist, underneath a black hole and no way out.
Yeah, I've changed my mind. Start worrying about me.
COMPUTER: Entering night shift Your chosen track for transition is Ravel's Bolero, (BOLERO PLAYING ON PA) All finished. Heading back inside.
Server Gamma 10.
Server Gamma 11.
Server Gamma 12.
(PA CUTS OUT ABRUPTLY) VOICE: (WHISPERING) Toby.
I can see you.
Danny, is that you?
It's not funny, all right?
Dan?
I'm trying to work, Daniel.
(STUTTERING) If that's you, Dan, can you just stop it?
(BUZZING) ZACK: (ON PA) Danny, check the temperature in Ood Habitation.
It seems to be rising.
Help yourself, just don't have the green.
Or the blue.
Um, a bit of that, thanks.
Would you like sauce with that?
I'll have a go, yeah.
I did that job once. I was a dinner lady.
Not that I'm calling you a lady.
Although, I don’t know, you might be.
Do you actually get paid, though? Do they give you money?
The Beast and his armies shall rise from the Pit to make war against God.
I'm sorry?
Apologies. I said I hope you enjoy your meal.
Yeah.
COMPUTER: Drill head now at point 16.
Drill head speed increasing.
Keep pressure at 60.
(GROWLING) Close door 3.
(MOCKING) Close door 3.
He is awake, What did you say?
Close door 3.
VOICE: (WHISPERING) Toby.
Don't turn around.
Dan?
That's not Dan.
Don't look at me.
(STUTTERING) Who are you?
I have so many names, If I could...
If you look at me, you will die.
But who are you?
I'm behind you, Toby.
I'm right behind you.
Don't look. Don't look at me.
One look and you will die.
I'm reaching out, Toby.
I'm so close.
Don't turn around.
Oh, I can touch you, No.
Zack, we got a problem?
ZACK: No more than usual.
Got the Scarlet System burning up. Might be worth a look.
You might want to see this. Moment in history.
There, on the edge.
That red cloud.
That used to be the Scarlet System.
Home to the Pallushi.
A mighty civilisation spanning a billion years disappearing forever.
Their planets and suns consumed.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed its passing.
No, could you leave it open?
Just for a bit. I won't go mad, I promise.
How would you know?
Scooti, check the lockdown.
Jefferson, sign off the airlock seals for me.
Open door 18.
I've seen films and things, yeah?
They say black holes are like gateways to another universe.
Close door 18.
Not that one. It just eats.
A long way from home.
Go that way, turn right, keep going for, erm...
about 500 years and you'll reach the Earth.
No signal.
That's first time we've gone out of range.
Mind you, even if I could...
What would I tell her?
Can you build another Tardis?
They were grown, not built.
And with my home planet gone, we're kind of stuck.
Well, it could be worse. This lot said they'd give us a lift.
And then what?
I don't know.
Find a planet. Get a job.
You live your life same as the rest of the universe.
I'd have to settle down.
Get a house or something. A proper house with...
doors and things. Carpets. Me, living in a house!
Now, that... That... That is terrifying.
You'd have to get a mortgage.
No. ~Oh, yes.
I'm dying. That's it, I am dying. It is all over.
What about me? I'd have to get one, too.
I don't know, could be the same one. We could both...
I don't know, share.
Or not. Whatever. I don't know. All sorts of...
Anyway...
We'll see, I promised Jackie I would always take you back home.
Everyone leaves home in the end.
Not to end up stuck here.
Yeah, but stuck with you, that's not so bad.
Yeah?
Yes.
(MOBILE RINGING) VOICE: He is awake.
DOCTOR: Evening.
Only us.
The mysterious couple. How are you, then? Settling in?
Yeah, sorry, straight to business. The Ood, how do they communicate?
I mean, with each other?
Oh, just empaths.
There's a low-level telepathic field connecting them.
Not that that does them much good. They're basically a herd race, like cattle.
This telepathic field, can it pick up messages?
‘Cause I was having dinner and one of the Oods said something...
Well, odd.
Hmm. An odd Ood.
And then I got something else on my...
communicator thing.
Well, be fair.
We've got whole star systems burning up around us, there's all sorts of stray transmissions.
Probably nothing.
Look, if there was something wrong, it would show.
We monitor the telepathic field.
It's the only way to look after them.
They're so stupid. They don't even tell us when they're ill.
Monitor the field, that's this thing.
Yeah.
But like I said, it's low-level telepathy. They only register Basic 5.
Well, that's not Basic 5. 10.
20.
They've gone up to Basic 30.
But they can't.
Doctor, the Ood.
What does Basic 30 mean?
Well, it means that they're shouting, screaming inside their heads.
Or something is shouting at them.
But where is it coming from? What is it saying?
What did it say to you?
Something about the Beast and the Pit.
What about your communicator? What did that say?
He is awake.
THE OOD: And you will worship him.
What the hell?
He is awake.
THE OOD: And you will worship him.
Worship who?
Who's talking to you? Who is it?
Toby, I've got your expenditure.
Open door 41.
Close door 41.
41?
Close door 40.
Computer, did you open and close door 41?
Confirmed.
But that's the airlock. Why would you open the airlock?
It's the night shift, we're not allowed outside.
Has someone gone out?
Confirmed.
But who was it?
Cannot confirm.
Okay. Right, hold on, I know.
Tell me whose spacesuit has been logged out.
No spacesuit has been logged out.
But...
You're not making any sense. You can't go outside without...
Zack, I think we've got a breakdown on door 41, It's saying somebody's gone outside onto the planet's surface.
(STATIC) Zack?
Zack?
Computer, trace fault.
There is no fault.
Tell me who went through that door?
He is awake.
What?
He is awake.
What's that supposed to mean?
He bathes in the black sun.
Toby.
There's no air, there's no...
No, stop it! You can't be!
Open door 40! Open door 40!
Open door 40! Open door 40!
Open door 40!
(SCREAMING) Emergency hull breach. Emergency hull breach.
Which section?
Everyone, evacuate 11 to 13. We've got a breach.
The Base is open. Repeat, the Base is open.
Open door 19.
Close door 19.
I can't contain the oxygen field. We're gonna lose it.
Come on! Keep moving!
And you, too, sunshine!
Everyone all right?
Breach sealed.
What happened? What was it?
Hull breach.
We were open to the elements. Another couple of minutes and we'd have been inspecting that black hole at close quarters.
That wasn't a quake. What caused it?
We've lost sections 11 to 13. Everyone all right?
We've got everyone here except Scooti.
Scooti, report.
Scooti Manista, this is an order, report.
ZACK: She's all right.
I've picked up her biochip. She's in Habitation 3.
Better go and check if she's not responding.
She might be unconscious.
ZACK: But how about that, eh? We survived.
Habitation 3. Come on.
I don't often say this, but I think we could all do with a drink.
Come on.
What happened?
(STUTTERING) I don't know. I was working and then I can't remember.
All that noise. The room was falling apart. There was no air.
Come on, up you get. Come and have some Protein One.
You've gone native.
Oi, don't knock it, it's nice.
Protein One with just a dash of Three.
There's no sign of her, but the biochip says she's in this area.
IDA: Scooti, please respond. If you can hear this, please respond.
Habitation 6...
Nowhere here.
Zack, we've got a problem. Scooti's still missing.
ZACK: But it says Habitation 3.
Well, that's where I am and I'm telling you, she’s not here.
I've found her.
Oh, my God.
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
Captain...
report Officer Scootori Manista, PKD...
deceased, 43K 2.1.
She was 20.
20 years old.
For how should man die better Than facing fearful odds For the ashes of his father And the temples of his gods?
(RUMBLING STOPS) It's stopped.
What was that?
What was it?
The drill.
We've stopped drilling. We've made it.
Point Q.
ZACK: All non-essential Oods to be confined.
Capsule established. All systems functioning.
The mineshaft is go. Bring systems online now.
Reporting as a volunteer for the expeditionary force.
Doctor, this is breaking every single protocol.
We don't even know who you are.
Yeah, but you trust me, don't you?
And you can't let Ida go down there on her own.
Go on, look me in the eye. Yes, you do. I can see it. Trust.
I should be going down.
The captain doesn't lead the mission. He stays here, in charge.
Not much good here, am I?
Positions!
We're going down in two! Everyone, positions!
Mr Jefferson, I want maximum systems...
Oxygen, nitro balance, gravity. It's ages since I wore one of these.
I want that spacesuit back in one piece. You got that?
Yes, sir.
It's funny ‘cause people back home think that space travel is gonna be all...
whizzing about and teleports, anti-gravity.
But it's not, is it? It's tough.
I'll see you later.
Not if I see you first.
You will remain here. No command can override this.
Have you got that?
My instructions only.
Capsule active.
Counting down, in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, release.
You've gone beyond the oxygen field. You're on your own.
Don't forget to breathe. Breathing is good.
Rose, stay off the comm.
No chance, (ALARM BLARING) Doctor? Doctor, are you all right?
Ida, report to me.
Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's all right. We've made it. Heading out of the capsule now.
ROSE: What's it like down there?
It's hard to tell.
Some sort of cave. Cavern. It's massive, Well, this should help. Gravity globe.
That's...
That's...
Oh, my God. That's beautiful.
Rose...
you can tell Toby...
we've found his civilisation.
Oi, Toby, sounds like you've got plenty of work.
Good, good.
Good.
Concentrate now, people. Keep on the mission.
Ida, what about the power source?
We're close, Energy signature indicates north-northwest.
Are you getting pictures up there?
ZACK: There's too much interference. We're in your hands.
Well, we've come this far. There's no turning back.
DOCTOR: Oh, did you have to?
No turning back? That's almost as bad as, “Nothing can possibly go wrong" or "This is gonna be the best Christmas Walford's ever had.” Have you finished?
Yeah. Finished.
Captain, sir, there's something happening with the Ood, What are they doing?
They're staring at me.
I've told them to stop, but they won't.
Danny, you're a big boy, I think you can take being stared at.
But the telepathic field, sir, it's at Basic 100.
I've checked. There isn't any fault.
It's definitely 100.
ZACK: But that’s impossible, What's Basic 100 mean?
They should be dead.
Basic 100 is brain death.
But they're safe? They're not actually moving?
No, sir, Keep watching them. And you, Jefferson, keep a guard on the Ood.
Officer at arms.
You can't fire a gun in here. What if you hit a wall?
Firing Stock 15, only impacts upon organics.
Keep watch. Guard them.
Yes, sir.
DOCTOR: Is everything all right up there?
Yeah, yeah.
It's fine.
Great.
DOCTOR: We've found something.
It looks like metal, like some sort of seal.
I've got a nasty feeling the word might be “trap door”.
Not a good word, trap door. Never met a trap door I liked.
IDA: The edge is covered with those symbols.
~ZACK: Do you think it opens?
That's what trap doors tend to do.
Trap door doesn't do it justice. It's massive, Zack.
About 30 feet in diameter.
ZACK: Any way of opening it?
Don't know. I can't see any sort of mechanism.
DOCTOR: I suppose that's the writing. It would tell us what to do.
The letters that defy translation.
Toby, did you get anywhere with decoding it?
Toby, they need to know. That lettering, does it make any sort of sense?
I know what it says.
Then tell them.
When did you work that out?
It doesn't matter, just tell them!
(DISTORTED VOICE) These are the words of the Beast.
And he has woken.
He is the heart that beats in the darkness.
He is the blood that will never cease.
And now he will rise, Officer, you will stand down. Stand down!
What is it? What's he done? What's happening? Rose, what's going on?
Jefferson, report.
Report!
Officer, you have compromised security.
You will stand down and be confined. Immediately!
Mr Jefferson, tell me, sir... did your wife ever forgive you?
I don't know what you mean.
Let me tell you a secret.
She never did.
Officer, you will stand down and be confined.
Or what?
Or under the strictures of Condition Red, Tam authorised to shoot you.
But how many can you kill?
THE OOD: We are the legion of the Beast.
Rose, what is it? Rose?
I'm going back up.
ZACK: Report! Report!
Jefferson, report!
Someone report!
The legion shall be many and the legion shall be few.
It's the Ood.
Sir, we have contamination of the livestock.
Doctor, I don't know what it is. It's like they're possessed.
They won't listen to us.
THE OOD: He has woven himself in the fabric of your life since the dawn of time.
Some may call him Abbadon.
Some may call him Krop Tor.
Some may call him Satan or Lucifer.
Captain, it's the Ood. They're out of control.
. the King of Despair, the Deathless Prince.
The Bringer of Night.
And these are the words that shall set him free.
Back up to the door!
I am become manifest.
Move quickly!
I shall walk in the light. To the door!
And my legions will swarm across worlds.
Doctor, it's opening!
We're moving!
The whole thing's moving, the planet's moving.
I am the sin and the temptation and the desire.
I am the pain and the loss and the death of hope.
JEFFERSON: Get that door open!
The gravity field, it's going!
We're losing orbit!
We're gonna fall into the black hole!
I have been imprisoned for eternity.
But no more.
COMPUTER: Door sealed. Door sealed.
BEAST: The Pit is open and I am free!
(BEAST LAUGHING) DANNY: It's the Ood. They've gone mad.
Doctor, can you hear me? Doctor, Ida, are you there?
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a sanctuary base! Deep space exploration.
"Welcome to hell.” DOCTOR: What are you lot doing here?
“That's a black hole.
But that's impossible.
This lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit around that black hole, without falling in.
There's some sort of power source holding us here.
We're drilling down to try and find it.
The Tardis is gone.
Well, whatever it is down there, it's not a natural phenomenon.
And there was some form of civilisation.
They buried something.
What are they called?
They're the Ood.
Basic slave race, There's something happening with the Ood.
THE OOD: And you will worship him.
(GROWLING) You can tell Toby we've found his civilisation.
(DISTORTED VOICE) These are the words of the Beast.
And he has woken.
I have been imprisoned for eternity.
But no more.
BEAST: The Pit is open and I am free!
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Open fire!
We're stabilising. We've got orbit.
Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? Doctor, Ida, are you there?
It's me!
But they're coming. It's the Ood.
They've gone mad.
How many of them?
All of them, all 50.
Danny, out of the way. Out of the way!
But they're armed. It's the interface device.
I don't know how, but they're using it as a weapon.
Close door 1.
Open door 1. Close door 1.
Lockdown! Seal door 1!
DANNY: Seal door 25. Seal door 24, Seal door 23!
Jefferson, what's happening there?
I've got very little ammunition, sir. How about you?
All I've got is a bolt-gun with, uh, all of one bolt.
I could take out a grand total of one Ood. Fat lot of good that is.
Given the emergency, I recommend strategy nine.
Strategy nine agreed. Right, we need to get everyone together.
Rose, what about Ida and the Doctor? Any word?
I can't get a reply. Just nothing. I keep trying, but it's...
DOCTOR: No, sorry. I'm fine. Still here!
You could have said, you stupid...
(RADIO FEEDBACK) Whoa, careful!
Anyway, it's both of us, me and Ida. Hello!
But the seal opened up. It's gone.
All we've got left is this chasm.
ZACK: How deep is it?
Can't tell. Looks like it goes down forever.
The Pit is open. That's what the voice said.
But there's nothing. I mean, there's nothing coming out?
No, no, no. No sign of the Beast.
It said Satan.
Come on, Rose. Keep it together.
Is there no such thing? Doctor?
Doctor, tell me there's no such thing.
Ida, I recommend that you withdraw immediately.
But we've come all this way.
Okay, that was an order. Withdraw!
When that thing opened, the whole planet shifted.
One more inch and we fall into the black hole so this thing stops right now.
But it's not much better up there with the Ood.
I'm initiating strategy nine so I need the two of you back up top immediately. No...
Ida? Ida?
What do you think?
He gave an order.
Yeah, but what do you think?
It said, "I am the temptation.” If there's something in there, why is it still hiding?
Maybe we opened the prison but not the cell.
We should go down.
I'd go.
What about you?
Oh, in a second. But then again...
That is so human.
Where angels fear to tread.
Even now, standing on the edge, it's that feeling you get, yeah?
Right at the back of your head.
That impulse, that strange little impulse.
That mad little voice saying, "Go on, go on, go on.
"Go over, go on.” Maybe it's relying on that.
For once in my life, Officer Scott, I'm going to say...
retreat.
Now I know I'm getting old. Rose, we're coming back.
Best news I've heard all day.
What are you doing?
He's infected. He brought that thing on board. You saw it.
Are you gonna start shooting your own people now? Is that what you're gonna do?
Is it?
If necessary.
Well, then you'll have to shoot me, if necessary. So what's it gonna be?
Look at his face. Whatever it was, it's gone.
It passed into the Ood. You saw it happen.
He's clean.
Any sign of trouble, I shoot him.
You all right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Can you remember anything?
Just... It was so angry.
It was fury and rage and death.
It was him.
It was the Devil.
Come here.
DOCTOR: What's strategy nine?
IDA: Open the airlocks. We'll be safe inside the lockdown.
The Ood will get thrown out into the vacuum.
So we're going back to a slaughter?
The Devil's work.
IDA: Okay, we're in. Bring us up.
Ascension in three, two, one.
BEAST: This is the darkness.
This is my domain.
You little things that live in the light, clinging to your feeble suns which die, in the end...
ZACK: That’s not the Ood. Something is talking through them.
BEAST: Only the darkness remains.
This is Captain Zachary Cross Flane of Sanctuary Base 6, representing the Torchwood Archive.
You will identify yourself.
You know my name.
What do you want?
You will die here, all of you. This planet is your grave.
It's him. It's him. It's him.
If you are the Beast, then answer me this. Which one, hmm?
‘Cause the universe has been busy since you've been gone.
There's more religions than there are planets in the sky.
The Arkiphets, Quoldonity, Christianity, Pash Pash, Neo-Judaism, San Claar, the Church of the Tin Vagabond. Which devil are you?
All of them.
What, then you're the truth behind the myth?
This one knows me as I know him.
The killer of his own kind.
How did you end up on this rock?
The Disciples of the Light rose up against me and chained me in the Pit for all eternity.
When was this?
Before time.
What does that mean?
Before time.
What did “before time" mean?
Before time and light and space and matter.
Before the cataclysm.
Before this universe was created.
That's impossible. No life could have existed back then.
Is that your religion?
It's a belief.
You know nothing. All of you, so small.
The captain, so scared of command.
The soldier, haunted by the eyes of his wife.
The scientist, still running from daddy.
The little boy who lied, the virgin and the lost girl.
So far away from home.
The valiant child who will die in battle so very soon.
Doctor, what does that mean?
Rose, don't listen.
What does it mean?
You will die and I will live.
What the hell was that?
Thad that thing inside my head.
Doctor, what did it mean?
What do we do?
Captain, what's the situation with strategy nine?
.. the black hole, everything's true!
We've lost pictures.
How did it know...
Did anyone get an analysis?
Jefferson.
Stop. Everyone, just stop!
What do we do? Report...
(RADIO FEEDBACK) If you want voices in the dark, then listen to mine.
That thing is playing on very basic fears.
Darkness, childhood, nightmares, all that stuff.
But that's how the Devil works.
Or a good psychologist.
How did it know about my father?
Okay, but what makes his version of the truth any better than mine, hmm?
‘Cause I'll tell you what I can see. Humans.
Brilliant humans. Humans who travel all the way across space.
Flying in a tiny little rocket right into the orbit of a black hole, just for the sake of discovery. That's amazing!
Do you hear me? Amazing. All of you.
The captain, his officer, his elder, his juniors, his friends.
All with one advantage, the Beast is alone, we are not.
If we can use that to fight against him...
The cable's snapped!
Get out!
Doctor, we lost the cable. Doctor, are you all right?
Doctor?
Comms are down.
Doctor, can you hear me?
I've still got life-signs, but we've lost the capsule.
ROSE: Say something! Are you there?
There's no way out.
They're stuck down there.
DOCTOR: How much air have we got?
Sixty minutes.
Fifty-five.
But we've got to bring them back.
They're ten miles down. We haven't got another ten miles of cable.
(THUDDING) Captain, situation report?
It's the Ood. They're cutting through the door bolts. They're breaking in.
Yes. Same on door 25.
How long is it gonna take?
Well, it's only a basic frame. Should take ten minutes.
Eight.
I've got a security frame, might last a bit longer but that doesn't help you.
Right. So we need to stop them or get out or both.
I'll take both, yeah? But how?
You heard the Doctor. Why do you think that thing cut him off?
‘Cause he was making sense.
He was telling you to think your way out of this.
Come on! For starters, we need some lights.
Zack, there's got to be some sort of power somewhere.
There's nothing I can do. Some captain! Stuck in here, pressing buttons.
That's what the Doctor meant. Press the right buttons.
They've gutted the generators.
But the rocket's got an independent supply.
If I could reroute that...
Mr Jefferson, open the bypass conduits.
Override the safety.
Opening bypass conduits, sir.
Channelling rocket feed.
In three, two, one.
Power.
There we go!
Let there be light!
What about that strategy nine thing?
Not enough power, needs 100 percent.
Right, we need a way out. Zack, Mr Jefferson, you start working on that.
Toby, what about you? I'm not a soldier. I can't do anything.
No, you're the archaeologist. What do you know about the Pit?
Nothing, we can't even translate the language.
Right.
Hold on. Maybe...
What is it?
Since that thing was inside my head, it's like the letters make more sense.
Well, get to work. Anything you can translate, just, anything.
As for you, Danny boy, you're in charge of the Ood.
Any way of stopping them?
Well, I don't know.
Then find out. The sooner we get control of the base, the sooner we can get the Doctor out. Now get going. Shift.
We've got all this cable. We might as well use it.
The drum is disconnected. We could adapt it.
Feed it through.
DOCTOR: And then what?
Abseil into the Pit.
Abseil. Right.
We're running out of air with no way back. It's the only thing we can do, even if it's the last thing we ever achieve.
I'll get back. Rose is up there.
Well, maybe the key to that is finding out what's in the Pit.
Well, it's half of a good plan.
What's the other half?
I go down, not you.
Open junctions five, six, seven.
Reroute filters 16 to 24. Go.
There's all sorts of viruses that could stop the Ood.
Trouble is, we haven't got them on board.
Well, that's handy, listing things we haven't got.
We haven't got a swimming pool either, or a Tesco's, Oh, my God. It says yes! I can do it!
Hypothetically, if you flip the monitor, broadcast a flare, it can disrupt the telepathy. Brainstorm!
What happens to the Ood?
It'll tank them, spark-out!
There we are, then. Do it!
I know, but...
I'd have to transmit from the central monitor.
We need to go to Ood Habitation.
That's what we'll do, then.
Mr Jefferson, sir, any way out?
Just about.
There's a network of maintenance tunnels running underneath the base.
We should be able to gain access from here.
Ventilation shafts.
I appreciate the reference, but there's no ventilation.
No air, in fact, at all.
They were designed for machines, not life forms, But I can manipulate the oxygen field from here, create discrete pockets of atmosphere.
If I control it manually, I can follow you through the network.
Right. So we go down and you make the air follow us by hand?
You wanted me pressing buttons.
Yep, I asked for it. Okay, we need to get to Ood Habitation. Work out a route.
IDA: That should hold it. How's it going?
DOCTOR: Fine. Should work.
Doesn't feel like such a good idea now.
Hmm. There it is again. That itch.
Go down, go down, go down, go down!
The urge to jump.
Do you know where it comes from, that sensation?
Genetic heritage. Ever since we were primates in the trees.
It's our body's way of testing us, calculating whether or not we can reach the next branch.
No, that's not it. That's too kind.
It's not the urge to jump. It's deeper than that.
It's the urge to fall.
Doctor!
You okay?
Not bad, thanks.
The wall of the Pit seems to be the same as the cavern, just not much of it.
There's a crust about 20 feet down.
And then...
nothing, just the Pit.
Okay, then. Lower me down.
Well, here we go, then.
Danny!
Hold on, just conforming.
Danny, we've got to go now. Come on.
There!
Put that in the monitor and it's a bad time to be an Ood!
We're coming back. We're coming back to this room and we're getting the Doctor out.
Danny, you go first, then Miss Tyler, then Toby. I'll go last in defensive position.
Now come on, quick as you can!
God, it stinks. You all right?
Yeah, laughing. Which way do we go?
Just go straight ahead. Keep going till I say so.
Not your best angle, Danny.
Oi, stop it.
Don't know, could be worse.
ROSE: Oi!
Straight on till you find junction 7.1. Keep breathing.
I'm feeding you air. I've got you.
We're at 7.1, sir.
Okay, I've got you.
I'm just aerating the next section.
Getting kind of cramped, sir. Can't you hurry up?
I'm working on half power here.
Stop complaining.
Mr Jefferson said stop complaining. heard.
He heard.
The air's getting a bit thin.
He's complaining now.
I heard.
Danny, is that you?
I'm not exactly happy.
I'm just moving the air. I've got to oxygenate the next section.
Now, keep calm or it's gonna feel worse.
(METALLIC RATTLING) What was that?
Mr Jefferson, what was that?
What was that noise?
Captain, what was that?
The junction in Habitation 5 has been opened. It must be the Ood.
They're in the tunnels.
Open the gate.
I've got to get the air in!
DANNY: Just open if, sir!
Where are they? Are they close?
I can't tell. I can't see them.
The computer doesn't register Ood as proper life forms.
Whose idea was that?
Open the gate!
Danny, turn left, immediate left!
The Ood, sir, can't you trap them? Cut off the air?
Not without cutting off yours.
Danny, turn right, go right.
Go faster. They're gonna catch up.
I'll maintain defensive position.
You can't stop!
Miss Tyler, that's my job.
You've got your task, now see to it.
You heard what he said, now shift!
8.2, open 8.2!
Zack, open 8.2!
I've got to aerate it.
Open it now!
I'm trying!
Danny, stop it. That's not helping!
Zack, get it open!
Jefferson, I've got to open 8.2 by closing 8.1.
You've got to get past the junction, now move!
That's an order, now move!
I'm gonna lose oxygen, Jefferson.
I can't stop the automatics!
That's it, come on, come on!
Danny, turn left and head for 9.2. That's the last one.
Jefferson, you've got to move faster!
John! Move! Move!
Mr Jefferson! Come on!
Keep going!
(PANTING) I regret to inform you, sir, I was a bit slow.
Not so fast these days.
I can't open 8.1, John. Not without losing air for the others.
And quite right, too, sir.
I think I bought them a little time.
There's nothing I can do, John.
I'm sorry.
You've done enough, sir.
Made a very good captain under the circumstances.
Might I ask, if you can't add oxygen to this section, can you speed up the process of its removal?
I don't understand. What do you mean?
Well, if I might choose the manner of my departure, sir, lack of air seems more natural than, well...
let's say, death by Ood.
I'd appreciate it, sir.
Godspeed, Mr Jefferson.
Thank you, sir.
Report. Officer John Maynard Jefferson, PKD...
deceased, with honours, 43K 2.1.
Zack, we're at the final junction.
9.2.
And, uh, if my respects could be on record, he saved our lives.
Noted. Opening 9.2.
ROSE: Lower 9.2! Zack, lower it! DANNY: Back, back, back!
We can't go back. Look, 8.2's sealed off. We're stuck!
Come on! Up!
Come on. Toby, come on!
Toby, get out of there!
Help me. Oh, my God! Help me!
It's this way!
Hurry up!
~Get it in.
TOBY: Danny, get it done.
Transmit! I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm getting it in...
Stop them!
ROSE: Danny, get that thing transmitting.
(ELECTRONIC BUZZING) You did it! We did it!
Yes! Oh, yes!
Zack, we did it. The Ood are down! Now we've got to get the Doctor.
I'm on my way.
DOCTOR: You get representations of the horned beast right across the universe, in the myths and legends of a million worlds, Earth, Draconia, Vel Consadine.
Daemos, the Kaled God of War. It's the same image over and over again.
Maybe that idea came from somewhere, bleeding through.
A thought at the back of every sentient mind.
Emanating from here? ~Could be.
But if this is the original, does that make it real?
Does that make it the actual Devil, though?
Well, if that's what you want to believe.
Maybe that's what the Devil is in the end, an idea.
That's it.
That's all we've got.
You getting any sort of read out?
Nothing.
Could be miles to go yet.
Or it could be 30 feet. There's no way of telling.
I could survive 30 feet.
Oh, no, you don't. I'm pulling you back up.
What are you doing?
You bring me back, we're just gonna sit there and run out of air.
I've got to go down.
But you can't.
Doctor, you can't!
Call it an act of faith.
I don't want to die on my own.
I know.
Doctor, are you there? Doctor, Ida, can you hear me?
The comms are still down.
I can patch them through the central desk and boost the signal.
Just give me a minute.
I didn't ask. Have you got any sort of faith?
Not really.
I was brought up Neo-Classic Congregational.
Because of my mum, she was...
My old mum.
But, no, I never believed.
Neo-Classics. Have they got a devil?
No, not as such. Just, um...
the things that men do.
Same thing in the end.
What about you?
I believe... I believe I haven't seen everything, I don't know.
It's funny, isn’t it?
The things you make up, the rules.
If that thing had said it came from beyond the universe, I'd believe it.
But before the universe?
Impossible.
Doesn't fit my rule.
Still, that's why I keep travelling.
To be proved wrong.
Thank you, Ida.
Don't go!
If they get back in touch...
If you talk to Rose, just tell her...
Tell her...
Oh, she knows.
ROSE: Doctor, are you there? Doctor, Ida, can you hear me?
Are you there, Doctor?
He's gone.
What do you mean, he’s gone?
He fell...
into the Pit.
And I don't know how deep it is, miles and miles and miles.
What do you mean, he fell?
I couldn't stop him.
He said your name.
I'm sorry.
Ida?
There's no way of reaching you. No cable, no backup.
You're ten miles down. We can't get there.
You should see this place, Zack.
It's beautiful.
I wanted to discover things, and here I am.
We've got to abandon the base.
I'm declaring this mission unsafe.
All we can do is make sure no one ever comes here again.
But we'll never find out what it was.
Well, maybe that's best.
Yeah.
Officer Scott...
It's all right.
Just go.
Good luck.
And you.
Danny, Toby, close down the feed-Links. Get the retrotopes online.
Then get to the rocket and strap yourselves in. We're leaving.
I'm not going.
Rose, there's space for you.
No, I'm gonna wait for the Doctor, just like he'd wait for me.
I'm sorry, but he's dead.
You don't know him.
‘Cause he's not.
I'm telling you, he's not.
And even if he was, how could I leave him all on his own, all the way down there?
No, I'm... I'm gonna stay.
Then I apologise for this.
Danny, Toby, make her secure.
No! No! No! Stop! No! Let me go!
Get off me! I'm not leaving! No!
I have lost too many people. Tam not leaving you behind.
Let's get her on board.
Did that one just move?
It's the telepathic field.
It's reasserting itself!
Move it, Get to the rocket! Move!
(GROANING SOFTLY) (GASPING) I'm breathing.
Air cushion to support the fall.
You can breathe down here, Ida.
Can you hear me, Ida?
Dislocating B clamp, C clamp. Raising Blu-Nitro to maximum.
Toby, how's the Negapact feed-line?
Clear, ready to go, sir.
For God's sake, get us out of here!
Captain, I think we're gonna have a problem passenger.
Keep an eye on her.
It's all right, Rose. We're safe.
I'm not going anywhere!
Get me out of this thing. Get me out!
And liftoff!
(WHOOPING) The rocket.
Take me back to the planet.
Take me back!
Or what?
Or I'll shoot.
Would you, though? Would you really?
Is that what your Doctor would want?
I'm sorry, but it's too late anyway. Take a look outside. We can't turn back.
This is what the Doctor would have wanted. Isn't that right?
History of some big battle. Man against Beast.
I don't know if you're getting this, Ida. Hope so.
Anyway, they defeated the Beast and imprisoned it.
And maybe that's the key.
Or the gate or the bars.
(LOW GROWLING) What's the joke?
Just... We made it. We escaped.
We actually did it.
Not all of us.
We're not out of it yet.
We're still the first people in history to fly away from a black hole.
Toby, read me the stats.
Gravity funnel holding, sir. Oh, it's holding.
I accept that you exist.
I don't have to accept what you are. But your physical existence, I give you that.
(BEAST GROWLING SOFTLY) I don't understand.
I was expected down here.
I was given a safe landing and air.
You need me for something. What for?
Have I got to...
I don't know, beg an audience or... Is there a ritual?
Some sort of incantation or summons or spell?
All these things I don't believe in, are they real?
Speak to me! Tell me!
You won't talk or you can't talk.
Hold on, hold on. Wait a minute. Just let me...
Oh! No. Yes! No.
Think it through. You spoke before, I heard your voice.
An intelligent voice. No, more than that. Brilliant!
But looking at you now, all I can see...
is beast.
The animal, just the body.
You're just the body, the physical form.
What's happened to your mind, hmm?
Where's it gone? Where's that intelligence?
Oh, no.
Stats at 53. Funnel stable at 66.5. Hull pressure constant.
Smooth as we can, sir. All the way back home.
Coordinates set for planet Earth.
You were imprisoned a long time ago.
Before the universe, after, sideways, in between, it doesn't matter.
The prison is perfect.
It's absolute. It's eternal. Oh, yes!
Open the prison, the gravity field collapses.
This planet falls into the black hole.
You escape, you die. Brilliant!
But that's just the body. The body is trapped, that's all.
The Devil is an idea. In all those civilisations, just an idea.
But an idea is hard to kill.
An idea can escape.
The mind, the mind of the great Beast, the mind can escape.
Oh, but that's it! You didn't give me air, your jailers did!
They set this up all those years ago.
They need me alive.
Because if you're escaping, then I've got to stop you!
If I destroy your prison, your body is destroyed, your mind with it.
But then you're clever enough to use this whole system against me.
If I destroy this planet, I destroy the gravity field.
The rocket.
The rocket loses protection, falls into the black hole.
I have to sacrifice Rose.
(LAUGHING) It doesn't make sense, We escaped, but there's a thousand ways it could have killed us.
It could have ripped out the air or, I don’t know, burnt us or anything.
But it let us go. Why?
Unless it wanted us to escape.
Hey, Rose, do us a favour.
Shut up.
Almost there. We're beyond the reach of the black hole in 40, 39...
So that's the trap or the test or the final judgement, I don't know.
But if I kill you, I kill her.
Except that implies in this big, grand scheme of gods and devils, that she is just a victim.
But I've seen a lot of this universe.
I've seen fake gods and bad gods and demigods and would-be gods, and out of all that, out of that whole pantheon, if I believe in one thing, just one thing, I believe in her.
What happened? What was that?
What's he doing?
We've lost the funnel! Gravity collapse!
What does that mean?
We can't escape. We're heading straight for the black hole.
This is your freedom! Free to die!
You're going into that black hole and I'm riding with you!
It's the planet. The planet's moving.
It's falling.
I'm the rage and the bile and the ferocity!
It's Toby!
I am the prince and the fool and the agony!
I'm the sin and the fear and the darkness!
It's him!
Stay where you are. The ship's not stable. What is he? What the hell is he?
I shall never die! The thought of me is forever.
In the bleeding hearts of men, in their vanity and obsession and lust!
Nothing shall ever destroy me. Nothing.
Go to hell.
Emergency shield!
We've still lost the gravity funnel. We can't escape the black hole.
But we stopped him. That's what the Doctor would have done.
Some victory.
We're going in.
The planet's lost orbit. It’s falling!
The planet's gone.
I'm sorry.
Accelerate.
I did my best.
But, hey, the first human beings to fall inside a black hole.
How about that?
History.
What happened?
We're turning.
We're turning around. We're turning away!
DOCTOR: (ON RADIO) Sorry about the hijack, Captain.
This is the good ship Tardis.
First things first, have you got a Rose Tyler on board?
I'm here! It's me! Oh, my God! Where are you?
I'm just towing you home. Gravity-shmavity.
My people practically invented black holes. Well, in fact, they did.
Couple of minutes, we'll be nice and safe. Oh, and Captain, can we do a swap?
Say, if you give me Rose Tyler, I'll give you Ida Scott. How about that?
She's alive!
Yes, Thank you, God.
Bit of oxygen starvation, but she should be all right.
I couldn't save the Ood.
I only had time for one trip.
They went down with the planet.
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Entering clear space. End of the line.
Mission closed.
I don't know. I can't remember.
Well, it looked like a box.
What do you mean, a box?
Well, down in the hold, a big blue box.
It just appeared. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Zack, we'll be off now. Have a good trip home.
And the next time you get curious about something...
Oh, what's the point? You'll just go blundering in.
The human race!
But, Doctor, what did you find down there?
That creature, what was it?
I don't know. Never did decipher that writing.
But that's good.
The day I know everything, I might as well stop.
What do you think it was, really?
I think we beat it. That's good enough for me.
It said I was going to die in battle.
Then it lied.
Right! Onwards, upwards. Ida, see you again maybe.
I hope so.
And thanks, boys!
Hang on though, Doctor, you never really said.
You two, who are you?
Oh, the stuff of legend.
(WHOOSHING) This is the final report of Sanctuary Base 6.
Officer Tobias Zed, deceased, with honours.
43K 2.1.
Also, Ood 1 Alpha 1, deceased, with honours.
Ood 1 Alpha 2, deceased, with honours...

@@@@@@
ROSE: Doctor! Doctor, look out! Doctor, he's going! Quick!
DOCTOR: Where's he gone? Do you see him?
ROSE: There he is. Stop! No! DOCTOR: Where is he?
ROSE: Watch out! DOCTOR: Where?
(SNARLING) That's what it did, it went...
(ROARING) And if you think that was the most exciting day of my life, wait till you hear the rest.
Oh, boy.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) So there I was, with that thing going...
Here, boy. Eat the food. Come on. Look at the lovely food, isn't that nice?
Isn't it? Yes, it is! Get out of here, quickly.
(IN BABY TALK) That's a boy! Who'd like a porky choppy, then?
I said run!
(SCREAMING) Wrong one! You made it worse!
You said blue.
I said not blue!
Hold on.
(DOCTOR AND ROSE SCREAMING) Hold on.
Don't I know you?
(WHOOSHING) You can't imagine it, the Doctor's machine.
The most beautiful sound in the world.
That wasn't the first time I met the Doctor and it certainly wasn't the last.
Oh, no.
I just put that bit at the beginning because it’s a brilliant opening.
But this is the story of me and my encounters with alien life forms.
But be warned! Because it is gonna get scary.
I need a remote control zoom.
I'm having to do that with a lean, the scary. Anyway.
But don't worry ‘cause it's not just me sitting here talking. Oh, no.
That's Ursula on camera.
Hello, My good friend Ursula Blake on my brand-new camera.
That was my family home, down there.
I did try but there's two women live there now.
They're a bit severe. So, never mind.
But that is where it all started ‘cause that's when I first met the Doctor.
What was it? I must've been three or four years old.
Middle of the night I went downstairs, and there was this man.
URSULA: So what happened? Elton? Tell me, why was he there?
I don't know. I still don't know.
All those years ago.
Okay, first things first.
My name is Elton, not to be confused with...
(ELTON JOHN PLAYING DANIEL) I left school, I got a job, transport manager at Rita Logistics, modest little haulage company, perfectly normal life, and then...
it all went mad!
ELTON: Two years ago I was in town, I was stocking up, you know, nothing special, all the usual stuff.
When all of a sudden...
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) Shop-window dummies come to life.
I survived, obviously.
Twelve months later, I'm back in town. I'm up West looking for a new suit, something nice and smart, when I hear this plane overhead...
(ENGINES ROARING) (BELL TOLLING) But it wasn't over yet. ‘Cause then, Christmas Day.
I'm in bed, fast asleep, nice and cosy, 7:45 in the morning, when all of a sudden...
And I'm stuck in bed, all right, ‘cause there's glass everywhere, and I was barefoot.
Thad to invent this rudimentary pulley system just to reach my boots, and by the time I'd done that...
And that's when it all started happening. That's how I met Ursula.
His name is the Doctor.
That's how I met Victor Kennedy.
You stupid man!
That's how I met Jackie Tyler.
You don't meet many Eltons.
And that's how I finally met the Doctor.
And realised the truth.
I should say this isn't, you know, my whole life.
It's not all spaceships and stuff.
‘Cause I'm into all sorts of things. I like football.
I like a drink. I like Spain.
And if there's one thing I really, really love, then it's Jeff Lynne and the Electric Light Orchestra.
‘Cause you can't beat a bit of ELO.
(MR BLUE SKY PLAYING) So, great big spaceship hanging over London, imagine the theories.
The internet went into meltdown.
But I kept on digging. Something was going on. Of, yes.
And then one day, on some obscure little blog by someone called Ursula Blake. It was, like, chance in a million.
It was him, it was that man again.
But the photo was new. It was taken on Christmas Day, but Christmas just gone, and he looked exactly the same.
His name is the Doctor.
Doctor what?
That's all anyone knows.
At Christmas Day, I was taking photos all over the place.
I went mad with it all, spaceships and lasers and everything.
We all went to Trafalgar Square that night ‘cause everyone was celebrating just being alive, and I snapped him in passing, that's all. He was just some bloke.
I didn’t realise he was significant until Mr Skinner pointed it out.
Who's Mr Skinner?
Oh, there's a few of us. The inner sanctum.
All studying this Doctor.
I've seen him, the Doctor, I swear to you. I saw him when I was a kid.
He was in my house and he was downstairs.
Don't tell me, he looked exactly the same then as he does now.
Yes. Yes.
Oh, my God, you believe me.
I'm not the only one...
ELTON: So that's how I met Ursula. All thanks to the Doctor.
Turns out we read all the same sites and she only lived half a mile away.
She was like a proper mate. Poor Ursula, (SCREAMING) But like she said, there was this little community, the select few, all with their stories of the Doctor.
ELTON: This little gang used to meet up underneath the old library on Maccateer Street.
Mr Skinner, first name Colin, but we always called him Mr Skinner.
I don't know why, we just did.
.. to me, the Doctor isn't a man, he's more a collection of archetypes.
ELTON: Then there was Bridget.
all these different Doctors come and go, but the single constant factor is this faux police box.
It keeps cropping up throughout history.
She lived way up north, but she travelled down without fail just for the meetings.
Then there was Bliss.
What I'm trying to do is sum up the Doctor. What he means to us.
ELTON: She was ever so sweet, Bliss. Bless Bliss, we used to say.
What he could represent and what he should represent and what he never won't represent sort of thing.
We should have a name. You know, as a group.
Names are very important.
What we need is a good, strong name, like a team. Something like...
London Investigation 'N' Detective Agency.
LINDA for short. ~Say it again?
London Investigation 'N' Detective Agency.
N"?
Fish 'n’ chips.
Rock 'n' roll. Chaka Demus 'n' Pliers, Ah!
LINDA, I like it. It's not too solemn. I like the 'N’.
We're the men from LINDA.
And the women.
LINDA united.
Did you think of that on the spot?
No, I've wanted to use it for years.
I give you LINDA.
ALL: LINDA!
So we'd all meet up every week and we'd talk about the Doctor for a bit. But after a while, Bridget started cooking.
Oh, my God, that's gorgeous! No, really. Wow.
The rest of you, get your hands off!
ELTON: Next thing you know, Mr Skinner started his readings, ‘cause he was writing his own novel.
SKINNER: "That's the last time you ride the Ghost Train, Johnny Franzetta.
"Now say your prayers!" To be continued.
ALL: No!
ELTON: Time went on. We got to know each other better and better.
I only started all this because my daughter disappeared.
But it wasn't aliens that took her away. It was just drugs.
I come down to London every week and I just keep looking for her.
Oh, Bridget.
# I gave my love a chicken # It had no bone # I gave my love a cherry # It had no stone # # I've got a brand-new pair of roller skates # You've got a brand-new key # ELTON: Then it turned out that Bridget could play the piano, and I confessed my love of ELO.
Next thing you know, musical LINDA.
# You got me running Going out of my mind # You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time # Don't bring me down # Just for fun.
# Don't bring me down # Grroosss # Don't bring me down # Grroosss # You go.
(INSTRUMENTS CLANGING) SKINNER: Now, careful. Mind the cables ELTON: And that's when it all changed.
That Tuesday night in March. That's when he arrived.
Lights.
ELTON: That's when we met Victor Kennedy.
And the golden age was gone.
So, we meet at last, LINDA.
Pleased to meet you, sir. I'm sorry, was the music too loud?
No, no, no, I don't shake hands. Back, back. I suffer from a skin complaint.
Eczeema.
Oh, you mean eczema.
Oh, this is worse, much worse. I blister to the touch.
Back, back, all of you, further, further. Thank you.
Sorry, don't mind me asking, but who are you?
I am your salvation.
URSULA: That's the Doctor. ELTON: That's really him.
Forgotten your purpose in life. You, with your band and your cakes and your blubbing, and all the while he still exists, the Doctor.
Look at him. Just look!
Move back, move back, all of you. Hold on, wait for this bit.
The picture cuts out, but the sound still continues.
Listen.
Listen to the sound of the universe.
(TARDIS WHOOSHING) VICTOR: Yes.
Oh, that's...
What is it? What's wrong?
Leave him!
You've heard it before, haven't you?
When? When was it? Where? Where were you?
I'd forgotten. Till now.
But it was that night.
What night?
I was just a kid.
That's why I went downstairs, it woke me up.
That noise.
(TARDIS WHOOSHING) But what is it? What does it mean?
That is the sound of his spaceship.
VICTOR: Right then, homework! Using the Torchwood files, we're able to look at all the old databases in a completely new light.
We're able to build up a more detailed profile of the Doctor.
I've allocated tasks to each of you. I'd like you to...
Careful, watch the eczeema.
I would like you to complete your targets and meet back here this time next week, one step closer to catching the Doctor.
Well, don't just sit there! Move!
Um, Bliss? It is Bliss, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yes.
Could I have a word with you in private, please?
~Course you can, yeah.
Thank you.
Goodbye, goodbye.
ELTON: Better get to work. Lots to do.
I never thought of it as work.
It's what we've always wanted, though. To find the Doctor.
Yeah, I suppose.
(BLISS SCREAMING) All of a sudden, without anyone saying so, we were working for Victor Kennedy.
ELTON: But we had to admit, he was right. His methods were much more rigorous.
It felt like we were getting closer and closer to the Doctor.
Mr Kennedy? “Yes, We were wondering...
No sign of Bliss. Do you know where she is?
Yes. Didn't she tell you? She's getting married.
She left a message. It'll never last. Stupid girl.
Come on, back to work!
But we did get lucky once.
A police box, newly arrived. It says newly arrived today.
It's in Woolwich.
Well, don't just stand there! Move! Move! Go! Go!
But don't get excited. That's where you came in.
ELTON: Woolwich, police box, red bucket, blue bucket, me so stupid, etcetera.
Useless!
I just froze.
You met him and you froze?
You stupid man!
You can't hit me ‘cause you don't touch.
You get a rash and an itch and everything.
I can use this!
Use that cane on him and you'll get one hell of a smack off me.
And then a good kick.
Is that completely understood, Mr Kennedy?
Duly noted.
Ursula Blake, most likely to fight back.
Right then, we'll change tack. We'll approach this sideways.
If we're to discover the truth about the Doctor, then we need to try and find her.
VICTOR: Now, when it comes to the Doctor's companion, the Torchwood files are strangely lacking.
It seems the evidence has been corrupted, something called Bad Wolf virus.
At least we've got these photographs.
They're first-hand evidence. Elton?
It was a London accent, definitely. She's from London.
So we hit the streets. We get out there. We take the photograph.
Someone's got to know who she is somewhere.
But London's a big place. I should know, my own daughter's out there.
Bridget, don't make this personal.
I don't like to be touched literally or metaphorically, thank you very much.
I haven't got the time. Bleeding hearts, outside.
Find me that girl! Go! Now! Move!
ELTON: And so it began, the impossible task.
To scour the mean streets, To search a major capital city for an unknown girl.
To hunt down that face in a seething metropolis of lost souls.
To find that one girl in ten million.
Oh, that's Rose Tyler. She lives just down there.
Bucknall House, number 48. Her mother's Jackie Tyler.
Nice family, bit odd.
(MR BLUE SKY PLAYING) i, Jackie!
Hello, sweetheart. I'll see you down the Spinning Wheel tonight, yeah?
Pub quiz. Get them in!
All right.
ELTON: I'd been trained for this.
Victor Kennedy's classes covered basic surveillance and espionage.
Step one, engage your target.
Find some excuse to start a conversation.
But how was I going to do this? How?
Excuse me, luv, you couldn't give us a quid for two fifties, could you?
Yeah. Just...
Oh, lovely. Cheers.
Step two, without provoking suspicion, get on first-name terms with the target.
My name's Jackie, by the way.
I'm Elton.
Oh, you don't meet many Eltons, do you? Apart from the obvious.
Step three, ingratiate yourself with a joke or some humorous device, I tell you what, Elton. Here we are complete strangers and I'm flashing you my knickers.
ELTON: Step four, find some subtle way to integrate yourself into the target's household.
Mind you, I'm only down here ‘cause my washing machine's knackered.
I don't suppose you're any good at fixing things, are you?
Here we are. It was the fuse, There's nothing wrong with the machine. That's fine, all working.
Oh, Elton, I should have you on tap.
I used to have this little mate called Mickey, he did all that stuff.
He's gone now, bless him.
Well, if you need me, give us a call. I'll jot down my number.
You do that and I'll make us a cup of tea.
Go on, go and sit down.
Put the telly on if you want. I can't bear it silent.
JACKIE: It's just me these days, rattling about.
There's my daughter, but she's gone travelling.
I keep her bedroom all nice and ready though, just in case she comes back.
And her name is?
Rose, That's a nice name, Rose.
So, where is she travelling?
All over.
She's got her mobile. I get a call now and then.
Not as often as I'd like.
Still, at that age, who can be bothered phoning home?
Yeah.
Who's she with? Is it mates, is it? Or...
Just mates, yeah.
Well, if I had you making a nice cup of tea like this, I wouldn't stray far from home.
You're a charmer. Say it again.
Magnificent! Oh, I could kiss you! Except I can't, of course. The eczeema.
I've even got a picture of her on my phone.
That's amazing.
You've achieved steps one to four in precise order. How did you manage it?
Thad to work very hard. She keeps everything very close to her chest.
That's a hell of a chest.
But how do you move on? Step five, that's the problem.
Step five. That's this week's homework.
I want a full plan of attack from each of you.
Now, go on! Vamoose! Avanti! There's work to do.
And, Elton, keep infiltrating.
You will do anything to get that information, boy, anything.
Yes, sir.
Oh... Oh, Bridget. Bridget? Oh, yes.
Could I have a word with you in private, please?
Mr Skinner's giving me a lift.
Oh, I can drop you at the station. I'm sure Mr Skinner won't mind, will you?
Not at all.
All right, Bridget, I'll see you next week.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Now, Mr Skinner, I don't mean to pry, but did you give Bridget a little kiss back there?
I think I did.
And if you get your way, might there be more little kisses between the two of you?
I think there might.
I knew it!
That's brilliant.
Now, let's not get excited. We'll see.
(BRIDGET SCREAMING) ELTON: Infiltration went well ‘cause Jackie kept phoning up, needing this and needing that.
It was strange, the amount of things that needed doing.
It’s like that flat was jinxed.
It's weird, these fuses, they keep on blowing.
You must be near a substation ‘cause then you get the power surges.
Still, there we go. Fixed!
Here we are. A little reward for my favourite handyman.
I shouldn't really, I've got the car outside.
You could always splash out on a taxi, or whatever, See what happens.
Right.
Cheers.
Cheers!
Very nice. What's that, French?
I suppose so.
They know how to do things, the French.
Is it from Rose? I mean, is she in France?
My daughter won't be coming back tonight, just in case you're wondering. We've got the place to ourselves.
Right.
Nice music.
Il Divo.
Yeah.
You were saying... Power surges.
From the substation, yeah.
Is that why it gets so hot in here?
Is it hot?
Oh, I think so.
You should take your jacket off.
No, I'm fine.
No, look, you must be boiling.
Oh, look at your shirt! Sorry!
(STUTTERING) I'm fine, it’s all right.
I've ruined it.
No, honestly, it's fine.
Take it off, I'll put it in the wash.
Oh, come on, it's only a little drop.
Oops.
There now.
Ruined.
ELTON: And there I was, the ultimate step five.
The perfect infiltration.
Target, Jackie Tyler.
Attaboy!
You're right, it is a bit hot, but it's about to get hotter.
I'll see you soon. All right, be careful. Bye.
Everything all right?
That was my daughter.
Oh, look at you. I'm sorry. I was just being stupid.
Is she okay?
She's so far away.
I get left here sometimes and I don't know where she is.
Anything could be happening to her, anything.
And I just go a bit mad.
Oh, put your shirt back on.
Where is she?
Doesn't matter.
I'm sorry. You better go.
Actually...
ELTON: And that’s when it struck me.
Funny the things you think of with your shirt off.
But that's when I realised what was really important.
Never mind about Rose. I'm not even gonna ask.
And I will put my shirt back on because I'm gonna go out and get us both a pizza.
‘Cause I reckon you need cheering up.
She goes swanning off and who's left to care about you, eh?
So I say, nice bit of pizza. We'll put the telly on nice and loud, we'll annoy that woman next door, just you and me, as proper mates.
Yeah? Mates, Go on, say yes.
Yes.
ELTON: All of a sudden, a lot of things made sense.
I'd got so lost in conspiracies and aliens and targets, I'd been missing the obvious.
‘Cause I did like Jackie, but I liked someone else even more.
(MR BLUE SKY PLAYING) Right. Let's get inside, then. The pizza's getting cold.
I went in your coat.
For once in my life I thought, “I'll pay.” I thought, “He's such a nice man, “he won't accept anything so I'll just slip a tenner in his pocket.” And look what I found.
A photograph of my daughter.
No, no, no. It's not like that. I can explain.
I bet you can.
I wasn't being pervy or anything.
I wasn't after her.
I was looking for the Doctor.
Oh, I know that.
I worked that out. Cause it's never me, is it?
No, but that's how it started, but I changed my mind.
Let me tell you something.
About those who get left behind. Because it's hard, And that's what you become, hard.
But if there's one thing I've learnt, it's that I will never let her down and I'll protect them both until the end of my life.
So whatever you want, I'm warning you, back off.
But, Jackie, I only wanted to meet him.
I thought you liked me. I do.
Just get out of here! I said get out!
And leave me alone!
She was right. It's shameful.
We used that woman.
I knew I couldn't trust you!
You broke cover. You stupid little man, you failed step five.
I don't care about step five!
‘Cause it's all gone wrong, Mr Kennedy, ever since you turned up.
We used to come here every week and we'd have a laugh.
We were friends.
No wonder they stopped coming. I mean, there's no Bliss anymore, and even Bridget, she hasn't turned up.
I've been phoning and phoning, there's no reply.
Who can blame her? I'm sorry, Victor, but you're on your own, ‘cause I am leaving and so are you, Mr Skinner.
And as for you, Ursula, you're coming with me.
And we're going to the Golden Locust and we're gonna have a Chinese.
What's that got to do with it?
I mean, you and me. Together.
Having a meal. If you want.
Oh, I'd love it.
But you can't leave.
You'll never know what he was doing, the Doctor.
You'll never know what he was doing in your house all those years ago.
No, I'll never know.
Ursula, get your stuff. Mr Skinner, are you coming?
Not to the Chinese if you don't mind. Just sort of walking out.
I certainly am.
Victor, good luck. Goodbye.
Mr Skinner, would you stay for a minute, please?
We're walking out.
I've got numbers for Bridget. I've kept records. I've got old numbers.
We could track her down together, you and I.
That's more like the old team spirit.
You two have a nice time.
I hope you find her. I'll email you.
Just come a little closer.
(SKINNER SCREAMING) I love prawns. Crispy aromatic duck.
Do you?
Oh, I left my phone.
Really?
Yeah.
It's not in my pocket.
So much for the big exit.
Yeah.
Come on, hurry up.
I'm not stopping, I just left my... phone.
Victor?
Take your phone and go.
Where's Mr Skinner?
He's gone to the toilet.
But we haven't got toilets, we have to use the pub on the corner.
Well, that's where he is, then.
SKINNER: Help me!
What was that?
It was nothing. It was nothing!
SKINNER: Help me! VICTOR: Shut up!
That's Mr Skinner, Victor, look at your hands.
VICTOR: (DISTORTED VOICE) Look at the rest of me, You've dabbled with aliens, now meet the genuine article.
Oh, my God!
You're a thing.
A thing?
This thing is my true form.
Better than that crude pink shape you call a body.
What happened? Where am I? Ursula, is that you?
That's Mr Skinner. What have you done to him?
I've absorbed him.
Colin? Is that you? Colin?
Bridget, my love.
Oh, my God! That's Bridget.
Colin, where are you? I'm here, Bridget. It's all right, I'm close.
You've absorbed them both.
What about Bliss? Where is she?
(BLISS MUMBLING) What?
BLISS: I said you really don't want to know.
You've absorbed them. You're some sort of absorbathon!
An absorbaling.
An Abzorbaloff.
Yes, I like that.
Let them go. I'm ordering you.
Let those people go.
Oh, but they taste so sweet.
Just think about the Doctor. Ooh, how will he taste!
All that experience, all that knowledge.
And if I've got to absorb Jackie Tyler to get to him, then so be it.
Don't you dare!
If I have to beat them out of you!
Oh! Oh! No, no, please don't hit me!
Look at me, I'm such a slow and clumsy beast.
Please don't hit me.
Well, then. Give them back.
What, you mean like this?
Just one touch! That's all it takes!
No. Oh, no, no.
No!
No!
Leave her alone!
Don't touch me.
Oh, Elton.
I'm so sorry you can't touch me.
Ursula.
Most likely to fight back indeed.
Leave her alone!
(SCREAMING) Yes!
No, that's not fair!
She tastes like chicken.
Elton, where are you?
Please. Mr Kennedy, please.
I'm asking you.
I'm begging you, give her back to me.
I can't.
Once they've been absorbed, the process is irreversible.
Wait a minute. Now I've been absorbed, I can read his thoughts.
Oh, my God! Elton, you're next.
Get out of here.
Now you've seen him, he can't let you go.
Just run. Go on, never mind me. Get out!
Isn't she the clever one?
Run, Elton! Run!
Save yourself, boy!
Run for your life!
(BLISS MUMBLING) (GROWLING) Oh, what's the matter? Have you given up so soon?
There's no point. Where would I go?
Everything I ever wanted...
Has been absorbed.
Oh, Elton. Don't say that.
But it's true.
Then join us. Join us, little man.
Come on.
It's everlasting peace. Come on, join us.
Dissolve into me.
(WHOOSHING) Someone wants a word with you.
You upset my mum.
A great big absorbing creature from outer space and you're having a go at me?
No one upsets my mum.
At last. The greatest feast of all, the Doctor.
Interesting. A sort of absorbatrix...
Absorbaklon... Abzorbaloff...
Abzorbaloff, yes!
Is it me or is he a bit Slitheen?
Not from Raxacoricofallapatorius, are you?
No. I'm not that swine!
I spit on them! I was born on their twin planet.
Really? What's the twin planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius?
Clom.
Clom?
Clom. Yes, and I'll return there victorious, once I possess your travelling machine.
Well, that's never gonna happen.
Oh, it will.
You'll surrender yourself to me, Doctor, or this one dies.
You see, I've read about you, Doctor. I've studied you. So passionate.
So sweet. You wouldn't let an innocent man die.
And I'll absorb him unless you give yourself to me.
Sweet, maybe. Passionate, I suppose. But don't ever mistake that for nice.
Do what you want.
He'll die, Doctor.
Go on, then.
So be it.
Mind you, the others might have something to say.
Others?
URSULA: He's right!
The Doctor's right! We can’t let him.
Oh, Mr Skinner.
Bridget, pull! For God's sake, pull!
No! No!
If it's the last thing we ever do.
Bliss! All of us, together, come on!
Pull! LINDA united!
Stop it! Stop!
Pull!
(ALL GRUNTING) Elton! The cane, break it!
My cane! You stupid man!
(GROANING) What did I do?
The cane created a limitation field.
Now it's broken, he can't stop. The absorber is being absorbed.
By what?
By the Earth.
URSULA: Bye-bye, Elton.
Bye-bye.
Who was she?
That was Ursula.
(SNIFFLING) And that's it.
Almost. Because the Doctor still had more to say.
You don't remember, do you?
And then he explained.
That night, all those years ago.
There was a shadow in your house.
DOCTOR: A living shadow in the darkness.
An elemental shade that had escaped from the Howling Halls.
I stopped it, but I wasn't in time to save her.
I'm sorry.
ELTON: Because that was the night my mother died.
(MR BLUE SKY CODA PLAYING) We forget because we must.
So, there you go.
Turns out I've had the most terrible things happen, and the most brilliant things, and sometimes, well, I can't tell the difference.
They're all the same thing. They're just me.
You know, Stephen King said once, he said, "Salvation and damnation are the same thing." And I never knew what he meant.
But I do now.
‘Cause the Doctor might be wonderful, but thinking back, I was having such a special time, just for a bit.
Thad this nice little gang.
(DON'T BRING ME DOWN PLAYING) And they were destroyed.
It's not his fault.
But maybe that's what happens if you touch the Doctor, even for a second.
I keep thinking of Rose and Jackie, and how much longer before they pay the price.
URSULA: Oh, now don't get all miserable.
Come on, Elton. You've still got me.
Oh, yeah.
‘Cause the Doctor said he could do one last thing with his magic wand.
If I can key into the absorption matrix and separate the last victim.
It's too late for total reconstruction, but...
(BUBBLING) Elton! Fetch a spade!
Even then, after all that, the Doctor saved me one last time.
(GRUNTING) Here she is.
URSULA: Could be worse.
At least I'll never age. And it really is quite peaceful. You'd be surprised.
It's a relationship of sorts. But we manage.
We've even got a bit of a love life.
Oh, let's not go into that.
And I don't care what anyone thinks, I love her.
Oh.
But the thing is...
There you are, I even bought a remote zoom.
But what I wanted to say is, you know, when you're a kid, they tell you that it’s all grow up, get a job, get married, get a house, have a kid and that's it.
(SIGHS) But the truth is, the world is so much stranger than that.
It's so much darker and so much madder.
And so much better.
DOCTOR: 30th Olympiad.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
POSTMAN: Morning, love. WOMAN: Morning.
WOMAN: Hiya! MAN: All right.
Maeve? You okay?
No, love, I'm not.
You want me to call a doctor?
Doctor can't help.
Can't you... Can't you feel it, Trish?
Can't feel anything.
Boys! Get indoors! Get inside! Get ‘em inside!
What's up with you? They ain't done nothing wrong.
MAEVE: It's happening again!
GIRL: # ... sits in the old gum tree # Merry merry king of the bush is he # Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookabura # Gay your life must be # They're not safe.
They're in the garden.
That's what it likes. It likes it when they're playing.
Get ‘em in, I'm begging you!
# Merry merry king of the bush is he # Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookabura # Gay your life must be # Right, I've got my beady eyes on them. Come on, come on.
MAEVE: No! MAN: Tom?
MAEVE: What are you?
Where's he gone?
MAEVE: What do you want with our children?
(HUMMING) (DOCTOR WHO THEME) (WHOOSHING) Ah.
(WHOOSHING) Ah!
(DRILLING) So, near future, yeah?
Thad a passing fancy. Only, it didn't pass, it stopped.
30th Olympiad.
No way! Why didn't I think of this?
That's great. Aw!
DOCTOR: Only seems like yesterday a few naked Greek blokes were tossing a discus about, wrestling with each other in the sand, as the crowds stood around baying...
No, wait a minute, that was Club Med.
Just in time for the opening doodah ceremony tonight.
I thought you'd like that. Last one they had in London was dynamite.
Wembley, 1948.
I loved it so much I went back and watched it all over again.
Fella carrying a torch. Lovely chap. What was his... Mark? John, Mark?
Legs like pipe-cleaners, but strong as a whippet... Doctor...
And in those days, everyone had a tea party to go to...
Doctor!
You ever have those little cakes with the crunchy ball bearings on top?
You should really look at this!
You know those things?
Nobody else in this entire galaxy has ever even bothered to make edible ball bearings. Genius!
DOCTOR: Who's taken them, do you think?
Snatching children from a thoroughly ordinary street like this.
And why is it so cold?
Someone reducing the temperature?
ROSE: Says here he went missing this week.
Why would a person do something like this?
What makes you think it's a person?
(DOOR OPENING) ROSE: Whatever it is, it's got the whole street scared to death.
Doctor, what...
(CAR ENGINE FALTERING) There you go. Fifth today. That's not natural, is it?
Dunno what happened. Thad it serviced less than a month ago.
Nah, don't even try and explain it, mate.
All the cars are doing it, and you know what?
It's bonkers. Bonkers.
Come on then, pal, I'll help you shift it.
Quicker you're on your way, happier you'll be.
(GRUNTING) There we go.
Do you want a hand?
No, we're all right, love.
Well, you're not.
I'm tougher than I look. Honest.
(CAR ENGINE STARTING) Does this happen a lot?
DRIVER: Cheers, mate!
(SIGHING) Been doing it all week.
Since those children started going missing?
Yeah. Suppose so.
Hmm. Tickles.
What's your game?
My... Um...
Snakes and ladders. Quite good at squash, reasonable...
I'm being facetious, aren't 1?
There's no call for it.
Every car cuts out.
Council are going nuts.
I mean, they've given this street the works. Renamed it.
I've been tarmacking every pothole.
Look at that. Beauty, innit?
Yep.
And all this is because that Olympic torch comes right by the end of this close.
Just down there.
Everything's gotta be perfect, ain't it?
KEL: Only it ain't.
It takes ‘em when they're playing.
What takes them?
Danny, Jane, Dale, snatched in the blink of an eye.
MAN: Liar! You're a liar!
DOCTOR: I am a... I'm a... Police officer!
That's what I am. I've got a badge and a police car.
You don't have to get... I can prove it. Just hold on...
We've had plenty of coppers poking round here, and you don't look or sound like any of ‘em.
See? Look, I got a colleague! Lewis.
Well, she looks less like a copper than you do.
Training. New recruit.
It was either that or hairdressing. So... Voila!
What are you going to do?
The police have knocked on every door.
No clues, no leads, nothing!
Look, look, kids run off sometimes, all right?
That's what they do.
I saw it with me own eyes.
Dale Hicks in your garden playing with your Tommy, and then...
Right in front of me, like he was never there, There's no need to look any further than this street.
It's right here amongst us!
Why don't we...
Why don't we start with him!
There's been all sorts like him in this street, day and night...
Fixing things up for the Olympics!
Yeah, and taking an awful long time about it!
I'm of the opinion that all we've gotta do is...
That woman who just said... That's slander!
I don't care what it is!
I think we need to just...
I want an apology off her!
Stop picking on him!
Yeah! Stop picking on me!
MAEVE: And stop pretending to be blind!
It's evil!
I don't believe in evil.
Oh, no! You just believe in tarmackers with sack-loads of kidnapped kiddies in their van.
Hey, hey, that's not what she's saying!
Would you stop ganging up on me?
Feeling guilty, are we?
Fingers on lips!
In the last six days, three of your children have been stolen, snatched out of thin air, right?
Uh... Can I...
Look around you.
This was a safe street till it came.
It's not a person.
I'll say it if no one else will.
Maybe you're coppers, maybe you're not.
I don't care who you are. Can you please help us?
(DOCTOR SNIFFING) Want a hanky?
You smell it?
What's it remind you of?
Sort of metal?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh!
Danny Edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other.
Whoa! There it goes again.
Look at the hairs on the back of my manly hairy hand.
And there's that smell. It's like a burnt fuse plug or something.
There's a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished.
Whatever it was, it used an awful lot of power to do this.
(MEWING) You have to come down sometime, Chloe.
I'm busy, Mum.
Look at it in here.
Must've used up half a rainforest. That's Dale.
Why did you draw him so sad?
I didn’t draw him like that.
Dale made himself sad, so I'm gonna draw him a friend.
That's what he needs, more friends.
Have you seen the TV?
Look, this'll cheer you up. The torch is getting close.
It'll pass right by our street.
And tonight they'll light the Olympic flame in the stadium, and the whole world will be looking at our city.
MAN ON TV: ... they’re lining the street...
I mean, doesn't that make you feel part of something?
Sweetheart?
We've seen the Prime Minister, we've seen members of the Royal family...
Chloe?
I'm busy, Mum.
Okay.
...45 young Danny Fairweather carries the torch past them on this wonderful summer's day.
Very fitting. We've seen lots of our sporting royalty, too...
You're tired, Chloe, I heard you calling out again last night.
It's fine.
Nightmares?
I'm drawing.
MAN ON TV: Let me remind you where the torches come from...
Whatever they are...
..,journey from the temple of...
. they're just dreams. You do know that?
They can't hurt you.
I'm busy.
Unless you want me to draw you, Mum.
If you wanna stay cooped up in here, fine. I'll leave you to it.
Oh, aren't you a beautiful boy! Thanks!
I'm experimenting with backcombing. Oh.
I used to have one like you.
(CAT MEWING) What?
No, I'm not really a cat person.
Once you've been threatened by one in a nun's wimple, kind of takes the joy out of it.
(CAT MEWS) Come here, puss.
What do you wanna go in there for?
Doctor.
Whoa!
(EXCLAIMING) Ton residue. Blimey!
(DOCTOR EXCLAIMS) That takes some doing.
Just to snatch a living organism out of space-time.
This baby is just like, "I'm having some of that!" I'm impressed.
So the cat's been transported?
It can harness huge reserves of ionic power.
We need to find the source of that power.
Find the source and you will find whatever has taken to stealing children and fluffy animals.
See what you can see. Keep ‘em peeled, Lewis.
I've given you friends, and you still moan.
Moan, moan, moan. You're lucky.
You're all together. You don't know what it is to be alone, If you did, you'd be thanking me.
(PENCIL SNAPS) No!
(D0G BARKING) (THUDDING) (METALLIC CLINKING) (THUDDING) That you, puss cat? You trapped?
(METALLIC CLINKING) (CRASHING) Not gonna open it, not gonna open it. Not gonna open it...
(BUZZING) Stay still!
Okey dokey?
Yeah. Cheers.
No probs.
(EXCLAIMS IN RELIEF) I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me what the hell it is, ‘Cause I haven't got the foggiest.
Well, I can tell you you just killed it.
It was never living.
It's animated by energy.
The same energy that's snatching people. That is so dinky!
The go-anywhere creature. Fits in your pocket.
Makes friends, impresses the boss, breaks the ice at parties.
(LAUGHING) DOCTOR: Oh. Hi-oh. Here we go. Let's have a look.
Get out of here!
What's it say?
It is.
It's graphite.
Basically, the same material as an HB pencil.
I was attacked by a pencil scribble?
A scribble creature.
Brought into being with ionic energy.
Whatever we're dealing with, it can create things as well as take them.
But why make a scribble creature?
Maybe it was a mistake.
I mean, you scribble over something when you wanna get rid of it, like a drawing. Like a...
child's drawing.
He said it was in the street.
Probably.
The girl.
Of course! What girl?
Something about her gave me the creeps.
Even her own mum looked scared of her.
Are you deducting? think I am.
Copper's hunch?
Permission to follow it up, Sarge.
(DOORBELL RINGING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Rose. Can we see your daughter?
No. You can't.
Okay. Bye.
Why? Why do you want to see Chloe?
Well, there's some interesting stuff going on in this street, and I just thought...
Well, we thought that she might like to give us a hand.
~Sorry to bother you.
Yeah. Sorry.
We'll let you get on with things. On your own. Bye again.
Wait.
Can you help her?
Yes, I can.
MAN ON TV: The torchbearer is running up towards the Mall...
She stays in her room most of the time.
I try talking to her, but it's like trying to speak to a brick wall.
She gives me nothing, just asks to be left alone.
What about Chloe's dad?
~Chloe's dad died a year ago.
I'm sorry.
You wouldn't be if you'd known him.
Well, let's go and say hi.
I should check on her first, she might be asleep.
Why are you afraid of her, Trish?
I want you to know, before you see her, that she's really a great kid.
I'm sure she is.
Yeah.
She's never been in trouble at school.
You should see her report from last year.
A's and B's.
Can I use your loo?
She's in the choir.
She sings in an old folks’ home. Any mum would be proud, you know?
I want you to know these things before you see her, Doctor, because right now, she's not herself.
(DOOR RATTLING) All right there?
I'm the Doctor.
I'm Chloe Webber.
How you doing, Chloe Webber?
I'm busy.
I'm making something.
Aren't I, Mum?
And like I said, she's not been sleeping...
But you've been drawing, though.
I'm rubbish. Stickmen about my limit.
I can do this, though.
Can you do that?
They don't stop moaning.
TRISH: Chloe...
I try to help them, but they don't stop moaning.
Who don't?
We can be together.
Sweetheart...
Don't touch me, Mum.
(DOOR RATTLING) SINISTER VOICE: I'm coming...
I'm busy, Doctor.
Come on, Chloe, don't be a spoilsport.
What's the big project?
I'm dying to know. What you making up there?
ROSE: Doctor!
SINISTER VOICE: 'm coming to hurt you...
Look at it.
No, ta.
What the hell was that?
ROSE: Drawing. Face of a man...
What face?
Best not.
What have you been drawing?
I drew him yesterday.
Who?
Dad.
TRISH: Your dad?
But he's long gone.
Chloe, with all the lovely things in the world, why him?
I dream about him staring at me.
I thought we were putting him behind us.
What's the matter with you?
We need to stay together.
Yes, we do.
No, not you. Us.
We need to stay together, and then it'll be all right.
Trish, the drawings, have you seen what Chloe's drawings can do?
Who gave you permission to come into her room?
Get out of my house.
Tell us about the drawings, Chloe.
I don't want to hear any more of this.
But that drawing of her dad...
I heard a voice, he spoke.
He's dead.
And these? They're kid's pictures. Now get out!
Chloe has a power.
And I don't know how, but she used it to take Danny Edwards, Dale Hicks. She's using it to snatch the kids.
~Get out.
Have you seen those drawings move?
I haven't seen anything.
Yes, you have.
Out of the corner of your eye. “No.
And you dismissed it, because what choice do you have?
When you see something you can't possibly explain, you dismiss it, right? And if anyone mentions it, you get angry.
So it's never spoken of ever again. She's a child.
And you're terrified of her.
But there's no one to turn to, ‘cause who's gonna believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye? No one.
Except me.
Who are you?
I'm help.
(ROSE CLEARS THROAT) Those pictures, they're alive.
She's drawing people and they end up in her pictures.
Tonic energy. Chloe's harnessing it to steal those kids and place them in some kind of holding pen made up of ionic power.
And what about the dad from hell in her wardrobe?
How many times do I have to tell you? He's dead.
Well, he's got a very loud voice for a dead bloke.
If living things can become drawings, then maybe drawings can become living things.
(EXCLAIMS IN FEAR) Chloe's real dad is dead, but not the one who visits her in her nightmares.
That dad seems very real. That's the dad she's drawn, and he's a heartbeat away from crashing into this world.
She always got the worst of it when he was alive.
Doctor, how can a 12-year-old girl be doing any of this?
Let's find out.
(DOOR OPENING) Nice one, There we go. I can't let him...
(WHISPERING) Shh, it's okay. Trust him.
Now we can talk.
(IN SINISTER VOICE) I want Chloe! Wake her up!
I want Chloe!
Who are you?
I want Chloe Webber!
What have you done to my little girl?
Doctor, what is it?
I'm speaking to you, the entity that is using this human child.
I request parley in compliance with The Shadow Proclamation.
I don't care about shadows or parleyses!
So what do you care about?
I want my friends.
You're lonely, I know.
Identify yourself.
I am one of many.
I travel with my brothers and sisters.
We take an endless journey. A thousand of your lifetimes.
But now I am alone. I hate it.
It's not fair, and I hate it!
Name yourself.
Isolus, You're Isolus, of course.
Our journey began in the deep realms, when we were a family.
What's that?
The Isolus mother, drifting in deep space.
See? She jettisons millions of fledgling spores, her children.
The Isolus are empathic beings of intense emotion.
When they're cast off from their mother, their empathic link, their need for each other, is what sustains them.
They need to be together. They cannot be alone.
Our journey is long.
The Isolus children travel, each inside a pod.
They ride the heat and energy of solar tides.
And it takes thousands and thousands of years for them to grow up.
Thousands of years just floating through space?
Poor things. Don't they go mad with boredom?
We play.
You... play?
DOCTOR: While they travel, they play a game.
They use their ionic power to literally create make-believe worlds in which to play.
In-flight entertainment.
Helps keep them happy.
While they're happy they can feed off each other's love.
Without it, they're lost.
Why did you come to Earth?
We were too close.
That's a solar flare from your sun.
Would have made a tidal wave of solar energy that scattered the Isolus pods.
Only I fell to Earth.
My brothers and sisters are left up there, and I cannot reach them.
So alone!
Your pod crashed?
Where is it?
My pod was drawn to heat.
And I was drawn to Chloe Webber.
She was like me. Alone.
She needed me and I, her.
DOCTOR: You empathised with her.
You wanted to be with her because she was alone like you.
I want my family!
It's not fair!
I understand. You wanna make a family.
But you can't stay in this child. It's wrong.
You can't steal any more friends for yourself.
I am alone.
(THUDDING) SINISTER VOICE: I'm coming to hurt you. I'm coming...
Trish, how do you calm her?
TRISH: What?
When she has nightmares, what do you do?
What do you do?
I sing to her.
Then start singing.
SINISTER VOICE: Chloe, I'm coming...
# Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree # Merry merry king of the bush is he # Chloe!
Chloe!
(SINISTER VOICE FADING) # ... kookaburra, laugh, kookaburra # Gay your life must be # It came to her because she was lonely.
(CRYING) Chloe, I'm sorry.
Chloe usually got the brunt of his temper, when he'd had a drink.
The day he crashed the car, I thought we were free.
I thought it was over.
Did you talk to her about it?
I didn’t want to, But maybe that's why Chloe feels so alone, ‘cause she has all these terrible dreams about her dad, but she can't talk to you about them.
Her and the Isolus, two lonely kids who need each other.
And it won't stop, will it, Doctor?
Just keep pulling kids in.
It's desperate to be loved.
And it's used to a pretty big family.
How big?
Say around four billion?
MAN ON TV: ...7 and out of central London. It is remarkable.
The queue started a week ago for those desperate enough to be inside, and there are lots of them.
We're expecting a capacity crowd of 80,000 for this evening's opening ceremony. I have to say there's been...
We need that pod.
It crashed. Won't it be destroyed?
Well, it's been sucking in all the heat it can.
Hopefully that should keep it in a fit state to launch.
It must be close.
It should have a weak energy signature the Tardis can trace.
Once we find it, then we can stop the Isolus.
She's running a temperature.
I can't go into that now, Kirsty. Yes, we've got a doctor.
Yeah, he said he can help her.
We can scan for the same trace that I picked up from the scribble creature.
Just need to widen the field a bit.
(TARDIS DOOR SHUTTING) You knew the Isolus was lonely before it told you. How?
I know what it's like to travel a long way on your own, Give me the steino-magnetic... Um...
Thing in your left hand.
Sounds like you're on its side.
I sympathise, that's all.
The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people.
It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe. Two lonely mixed-up kids.
Feels to me like a temper tantrum ‘cause it can't get its own way.
It's scared. Come on, you were a kid once.
Binary dot. Yes.
And I know what kids can be like. Right little. terrors.
Gum. I've got cousins.
Kids can’t have it all their own way. That's part of being a family.
And what about trying to understand them?
Easy for you to say, you don't have kids.
I was a dad once.
What did you say?
I think we're there. Fear. Loneliness. They're the big ones, Rose.
Some of the most terrible acts ever committed have been inspired by them.
We're not dealing with something that wants to conquer or destroy.
There's a lot of things you need to get across this universe, warp drive, wormhole refractors. You know the thing you need most of all?
You need a hand to hold.
No, no, I'm pointing.
DOCTOR: It's the pod! It is in the street!
Everything's coming up Doctor.
Okay, it's like, two inches across. Dull grey, like a gull's egg, very light.
ROSE: So these pods, they travel from some sun using heat, yeah?
So it's not all about love and stuff.
Doesn't the pod just need heat?
(CRASHING) Doctor?
Doctor!
It's okay, I've taken all the pencils off her.
Leave me alone!
I want to be with Chloe Webber! I love Chloe Webber!
Bring him back now.
No!
Don't you realise what you've done?
He was the only one who could help you. Now bring him back!
Leave me alone! I love Chloe Webber!
I know.
I know.
Doctor, if you can hear me, I'm gonna get you out of there.
I'll find the pod.
Don't leave her alone, no matter what.
MAN ON TV: ... the torchbearer getting even closer to the Olympic Stadium, heading down the Strand, before turning east along the Embankment...
Heat. They travel on heat.
Look at this finish.
Smooth as a baby's bottom. Not a bump or a lump.
Kel, was there anything in this street in the last few days giving off a lot of heat?
I mean, you could eat your dinner off this.
Beautiful. So, you tell me why the other one’s got a lump in it when I gave it the same love and craftsmanship as I did this one.
Well, when you've worked it out, put it in a big book about tarmacking.
But before you do that, think back six days.
Six days.
When I was laying this the first time round.
What?
Well, that's when I filled in this pothole for the first time.
~Six days ago.
Yeah.
Hot, fresh tar.
Blended to a secret council recipe.
No, I don't keep it in the van.
Hey! That's a council van. Out.
Whoa! Wait... Wait a minute!
You've just removed a council axe from a council van.
Put it back! No, don't, wait.
If it's going in the van, that's my van. Gimme the axe!
Wait! No! No! You... Stop!
You just took a council axe from a council van, and now you're digging up a council road!
I'm reporting you to the council!
It went for the hottest thing in the street, yeah? Your tar.
What is it?
It's a spaceship.
Not a council spaceship, I'm afraid.
MAN ON TV: ... joined us, welcome. We're live on BBC News 24, The opening ceremony of the London Olympics of 2012.
Well underway, athletes from all over the world, streaming into the stadium right now. They all have their dreams, They've all put in years of hard work...
I found it!
Don't know what to do with it, but maybe the Isolus will just hop on board.
Hang on, I told you not to leave her.
MAN ON TV: My God! Uh, what's going on here?
I don't care if you got Snow White and the Seven Dwarves buried under there, you don't go digging...
Shut up and look!
The crowd has vanished.
Um, they're gone, everyone has gone.
Thousands of people have just gone, uh, right in front of my eyes.
Um, it's impossible, Bob, can we join you in the box? Bob?
Not you too, Bob!
ROSE: A stadium won't be enough.
The Isolus has four billion brothers and sisters, Over 80,000 spectators and 30,000 athletes...
Not enough.
They're gone, all of those people.
Uh, it's a terrible, terrible turn of events...
We won't be alone, Chloe Webber. We'll have all of them.
And then we'll never feel alone ever again.
TRISH: Chloe? ROSE: Chloe, it's Rose! Open the door!
We found your ship! We can send you home.
Chloe!
Open up!
Right, stand back.
SINISTER VOICE: I'm coming to hurt you.
I'm coming. Coming to hurt you, Chloe.
Chloe!
I'm coming to hurt you!
I'm coming. I've gotta stop her.
If you stop Chloe Webber, I will let him out.
We will let him out. Together.
I cannot be alone! It's not fair!
(GROWLING) Look, I've got your pod!
The pod is dead!
No, no. It only needs heat.
It needs more than heat.
What then?
I'm not being funny or nothing, but that picture just moved.
And that one!
She didn't draw that, he did.
But it needs more than heat, Doctor.
MAN ON TV: ... still on its way. I suppose it's much more than a torch now.
It’s a beacon, It's a beacon of hope and fortitude and courage.
And it's a beacon of love.
Love.
So let's have a look from the helicopter.
There we go, the torchbearer...
I know how to charge up the pod.
... past Dame Kelly Holmes Close...
(PEOPLE CHEERING) Sorry, you'll have to watch from here.
No, I've gotta get closer!
No way.
I can stop this from happening!
SINISTER VOICE: Chloe.
Chloe.
I'm coming to hurt you.
My baby!
You're not going to hurt her again!
Chloe! I'm coming!
(POD BEEPING) You felt it, didn't you?
(WHISPERING) Feel the love.
(ROSE CHEERING) I can go home.
Goodbye, Chloe Webber.
I love you.
Mum?
I'm here, Mummy!
Nice one! You did it!
What was it you did?
Yeah!
Mummy!
Oh, Jane!
Doctor?
MAN: He's back now.
I don't know who you are, or what you did, but thank you, darling.
And thank that man from me, too.
Where is he? He should be here.
All the drawings have come to life.
That means all of them.
(SINISTER VOICE GROWLING) Oh no...
Trish, get out!
I can't. The door's stuck.
Is the Doctor in there?
I don't think so.
Mummy!
(THUDDING) SINISTER VOICE: I'm coming to hurt you!
Please, Dad, no more.
Chloe!
Chloe, listen to me. It isn't real like the others.
It's just energy left over by the Isolus.
But you can get rid of it, Chloe.
Help us!
Oh, it's ‘cause you're so scared that he's real.
But you can get shot of him, Chloe.
Mummy!
ROSE: You can do it, Chloe!
I can't!
SINISTER VOICE: Chloe! I'm coming!
I can't!
I'm coming!
I can't!
I'm coming! Chloe!
Mummy!
I'm with you, Chloe. You're not alone. You'll never be alone again.
I'm coming to hurt you.
ROSE: Sing again. Chloe, sing!
Chloe! Chloe!
# Kookaburra sits...
Chloe!
# ... gum tree Chloe!
# Merry merry king of the bush # Chloe, I'm coming to hurt you.
BOTH: # Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookabura # Gay your life must be # Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookabura # Gay your life must be # (SINISTER VOICE FADING) # Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree # Merry merry king of the bush is he # Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookabura # Gay your life must be # Maybe he's gone somewhere.
Who's gonna hold his hand now?
MAN ON TV: Just look at this. Utterly incredible scenes at the Olympic Stadium.
80,000 athletes and spectators, they disappeared, they've come back.
They've returned.
They've re-appeared. It's quite incredible.
But, Bob, this will certainly prompt...
80,000 people. So where's the Doctor? I need him!
But hang on. The torchbearer seems to be in a bit of trouble.
We did see a flash of lightning earlier that seemed to strike him.
Maybe he's injured. He's definitely in trouble.
This mean that the Olympic dream is dead?
Doctor!
There's a mystery man.
He's picked up the flame, and we've no idea who he is.
He's carrying the flame, yes, he’s carrying the flame, and no one wants to stop him.
It's more than a flame now, Bob. It's more than heat and light.
It's hope, and it's courage, and it's love.
(SPECTATORS CHEERING) (WHOOPING) Go on. Join your brothers and sisters. They'll be waiting!
(CHEERING) Cake?
(LAUGHING) Top banana!
I can't stress this enough. Ball bearings you can eat. Masterpiece!
I thought I'd lost you.
Nah. Not on a night like this.
This is a night for lost things being found. Come on.
What now?
I wanna go to the Games, it's what we came for.
Go on. Give us a clue.
Which events do we do well in?
Well, I will tell you this, Papua New Guinea surprised everyone in the shot put.
Really? You're joking, aren't you?
Doctor? Are you serious, or are you joking?
Wait and see.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) You know what? They keep on trying to split us up, but they never ever will.
Never say, "Never ever." Nah, we'll always be okay, you and me.
(FIRECRACKERS BURSTING) Don't you reckon, Doctor?
Something in the air. Something coming.
What?
A storm's approaching.
ROSE: This is a story of war on Earth, DRAMATIC VOICE: The valiant child who will die in battle so very soon.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
ROSE: Planet Earth, This is where I was born, and this is where I died.
The first 19 years of my life, nothing happened.
Nothing at all.
Not ever.
And then I met a man called the Doctor.
Run!
A man who could change his face.
And he took me away from home in his magical machine.
He showed me the whole of time and space.
I thought it would never end.
How long are you going to stay with me?
Forever.
That's what I thought.
But then came the army of ghosts.
Then came Torchwood and the War.
And that's when it all ended.
This is the story of how I died.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) (WHOOSHING) Mum, it's us! We're back!
Oh, I don't know why you bother with that phone. You never use it, Shut up, come here.
Oh, I love you!
I love you so much!
Oh, no, you don't. Come here!
(DOCTOR PROTESTING) Oh, you lovely big fellow! Oh, you're all mine!
DOCTOR: Just... Just put me down! JACKIE: Yes, you are!
(ROSE GRUNTING) I've got loads of washing for you.
And I got you this.
It's from the market on this asteroid bazaar.
It's made of...
What's it called?
Bazoolium.
Bazoolium. When it gets cold, yeah, it means it's gonna rain.
When it's hot, it's gonna be sunny. You can use it to tell the weather.
I've got a surprise for you and all.
(SIGHING) I get her bazoolium, she doesn't even say thanks.
Guess who's coming to visit?
You're just in time. He'll be here at ten past. Who do you think it is?
I don't know.
Oh, go on, guess.
No, I hate guessing. Just tell me.
It's your grandad, Grandad Prentice.
He's on his way any minute.
Right. Cup of tea.
She's gone mad.
Tell me something new.
Grandad Prentice, that's her dad.
But he died, like, 10 years ago.
Oh my God, she's lost it.
Mum?
What you just said about Grandad...
Any second now.
But he passed away. His heart gave out. Do you remember that?
Of course I do.
Then how can he come back?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Ten past, here he comes.
Here we are, then.
Dad, say hello to Rose.
Hasn't she grown?
They're everywhere.
Alex.
You can play if you want to.
Doctor, look out!
JACKIE: You haven't got long.
Midday shift only lasts a couple of minutes. They're about to fade.
What do you mean, "shift"?
Since when did ghosts have shifts?
Since when did shifts have ghosts? What's going on?
Oh, he's not happy when I know more than him, is he?
No one’s running or screaming or freaking out.
Why should we?
Here we go. Twelve minutes past.
(MACHINE HUMMING) Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce we've just measured the Ghost Energy at 5,000 gigawatts.
Give yourselves a round of applause.
On today’s ghostwatch, claims that some of the ghosts are starting to talk, and there seems to be a regular formation gathering around Westminster Bridge.
It's almost like a military display.
What the hell is going on?
And tonight we're expecting very strong ghosts from London, through the north, and up into Scotland.
So basically, Eileen, what you're telling me is that you are in love with a ghost?
He's my ghost and I love him, 24/7.
Well, no one needs me any more.
My ghost was pale and grey, until I discovered Ectoshine!
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH) (SPEAKING IN HINDI) (SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) (GIRLS EXCLAIMING) It's all over the world.
Listen to me, Den Watts, I don’t care if you have come back from the grave, get out of my pub!
The only spirits I'm serving in this place are gin, whisky and vodka, So you heard me. Get out!
When did it start?
Well, first of all, Peggy heard this noise in the cellar, so she goes down...
No, I mean worldwide.
Oh!
That was about two months ago. Just happened.
Woke up one morning and there they all were. Ghosts everywhere.
We all ran round screaming and that.
Whole planet was panicking. No sign of you, thank you very much.
Then it sort of sank in.
Took us time to realise that we're lucky.
What makes you think it's Grandad?
It just feels like him.
There's that smell, those old cigarettes. Can't you smell it?
I wish I could, Mum, but I can't.
Well, you've got to make an effort.
You've got to want it, sweetheart.
And the more you want it, the stronger it gets?
Sort of, yeah.
Like a psychic link.
‘Course you want your old dad to be alive, but you're wishing him into existence.
The ghosts are using that to pull themselves in.
You're spoiling it.
I'm sorry, Jackie, but there's no smell, there's no cigarettes.
Just a memory.
But if they're not ghosts, what are they, then?
Yeah, but they're human.
You can see them. They look human.
She's got a point. I mean, they're all sort of blurred, but they're definitely people.
Maybe not.
They're pressing themselves into the surface of the world, but a footprint doesn't look like a boot.
So, what have we got? Any sign of that power loss?
No problems. Must have been a glitch.
Rajesh, you got anything?
It's so busy down here, I'm on Sudoku book 509.
Well, we just had a great Ghost Shift.
I know.
But we had nothing.
Did they tell you?
R&D came up with a new spectrometer yesterday.
Barged in here all full of themselves.
Said they could detect the heat off a single protozoa through half a mile of steel.
YVONNE: And what did they find?
Nothing. It gave them nothing.
Same as ever.
The machines keep saying the Sphere can't exist.
But there it is.
YVONNE: Anything we can do?
No, I'm all right.
It's just... Gets into your head, this thing. Like it's staring at you.
All right, we'll catch up later. Thanks, Raj.
Yeah.
Matt, get on to hospitality, will you?
Send Rajesh something. He's going mad down there.
Not alcohol.
TECHNICIAN: We've kept it stable at 56.1.
YVONNE: So, if you just check the statistics...
Yvonne, I'm gonna double-check the stacks.
Just in case. Sure.
Yvonne, I'm gonna cross-reference the levels with the Sphere.
Okay, fine.
And they think we haven't noticed.
(MAN CHUCKLING) Come on, we'll be all right down here. Just two minutes.
This is out of bounds, Yeah, and that's the point. It's completely safe.
They're just building new offices.
What about the workmen?
They must be allocated somewhere else.
It's not worth it for a snog.
It is.
Come on.
(SCOFFING) Gareth?
Now don't be daft. Where've you gone?
Gareth!
Look, I'm gonna head back. I'm seeing you tonight, anyway.
Gareth?
I'm gonna go back to work.
This is it.
I'm going.
See you.
Now stop it, Gareth! I'm not kidding, just stop it!
Sorry, I'm just looking for my friend.
Did anyone come down here?
According to the paper, they've elected a ghost as MP for Leeds.
Now don't tell me you're gonna sit back and do nothing.
"Who you gonna call?" ~Ghostbusters!
"I ain't afraid of no ghosts!" When's the next shift?
Quarter to. But don't go causing trouble.
What's that lot do?
Triangulates their point of origin.
I don't suppose it's the Gelth?
Nah. They were just coming through one little rift.
This lot are transposing themselves over the whole planet.
DOCTOR: Like tracing paper. JACKIE: You're always doing this.
Reducing it to science. Why can't it be real?
But just think of it, though.
All the people we've lost, our families coming back home.
Don't you think it's beautiful? I think it's horrific.
Rose, give us a hand!
Soon as the cones activate, if that line goes into the red, press that button there.
If it doesn't stop, setting 15B, hold it against the port, eight seconds and stop.
Fifteen B, eight seconds.
If it goes into the blue, activate the deep scan on the left.
Hang on a minute, I know. It's that one?
Close.
That one?
No, you've just killed us.
(EXCLAIMS) Er... That one?
Yeah! Now, what have we got, two minutes to go?
Two minutes till the next shift, let's make it a good one, people.
Come on, you two.
I'm sorry we're late.
Save it till later.
Sorry we're late.
And powering up!
(MACHINES REVVING UP) (BUZZING) What's the line doing?
It's all right, it's holding!
You even look like him.
How do you mean?
I suppose I do, yeah.
You've changed so much. ~For the better.
I suppose.
Mum, I used to work in a shop.
I've worked in shops. What's wrong with that?
No, I didn't mean that.
I know what you meant.
What happens when I'm gone?
Don't talk like that.
No, but really.
When I'm dead and buried, you won't have any reason to come back home.
What happens then?
I don't know.
Do you think you'll ever settle down?
The Doctor never will, so I can't. I'll just keep on travelling.
And you'll keep on changing.
And in 40 years’ time, 50, there'll be this woman, this strange woman, walking through the marketplace on some planet a billion miles from Earth.
But she’s not Rose Tyler, not any more.
She's not even human.
DOCTOR: Here we go!
Scanner’s working! It says, “Delta one six"!
Come on, then. You beauty!
And we're into Ghost Shift.
COMPUTER: Online.
(ALARM BLARING) What have we got?
Something's interfering with the Ghost Field.
Location?
It's close. It's within the city.
Look at that! Don't like that much, do you?
Who are you? Where are you coming from?
Whoa! That's more like it!
Not so friendly now, are you?
Close it down! Close it down!
COMPUTER: Offline.
(GHOST GRUNTING) It was a very specific excitation of the Ghost Field, but that makes it easy to pinpoint.
Almost there. South London.
South East 15.
It's a council estate, the Powell Estate.
SE15 7G0. It was a public area.
Can we patch into the CCTV network?
Doing it now.
(DOOR CLOSES) Here we go. We've got a camera within 50 yards.
Oh my God.
MATT: Is it him?
It's him.
I said so. Those ghosts are being forced into existence from one specific point, and I can track down the source, Allons-y!
(MACHINE WHIRRING) (TYPING) He's coming.
Rajesh, it's him!
Now we've got you.
I like that, allons-y. I should say allons-y more often. Allons-y!
Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!
And then, it would be really brilliant if I met someone called Alonso.
‘Cause then I could say, “Allons-y, Alonso”, every time. You're staring at me.
(WHISPERING) My mum's still on board.
If we end up on Mars, I'm gonna kill you.
Coming up! Let's do it!
Positions!
Covered, sir!
Ooh, well, there goes the advantage of surprise.
Still, cuts to the chase.
Stay in here, look after Jackie.
I'm not looking after my mum.
Well, you brought her.
I was kidnapped.
Doctor, they've got guns.
And I haven't. Which makes me the better person, don’t you think?
They can shoot me dead, but the moral high ground is mine.
SOLDIER: Hold it! Steady, lads, steady!
(GUNS COCKING) YVONNE: Oh!
Oh, how marvellous!
Oh, very good.
Superb. Happy day.
Um, thanks. Nice to meet you.
I'm the Doctor.
Oh, I should say. Hooray!
You've heard of me, then?
Well, of course we have.
And I have to say, if it wasn't for you, none of us would be here.
The Doctor and the Tardis!
And... And... And you are?
Oh, plenty of time for that.
But according to the records, you're not one for travelling alone.
The Doctor and his companion. That's the pattern, isn't it, right?
There's no point hiding anything. Not from us.
So, where is she?
Yes! Sorry, good point.
She's just a bit shy, that’s all.
But here she is, Rose Tyler!
Hmm, she's not the best I've ever had. Bit too blonde.
Not too steady on her pins. Lot of that.
And just last week, she stared into the heart of the time vortex and aged 57 years, but she'll do.
I'm 40!
Deluded.
Bless. I'll have to trade her in. Do you need anyone?
She's very good at tea. Well, I say very good. I mean not bad.
Well, I say not bad. Anyway, lead on! Allons-y/ But not too fast. Her ankle's going.
I'll show you where my ankle's going.
It was only a matter of time until you found us.
And at last you've made it.
I'd like to welcome you, Doctor. Welcome to Torchwood.
That's a Jathaa Sun Glider.
Came down to Earth off the Shetland Islands 10 years ago.
What, did it crash?
No, we shot it down.
It violated our airspace, then we stripped it bare.
The weapon that destroyed the Sycorax on Christmas Day?
That was us.
Now, if you'd like to come with me.
The Torchwood Institute has a motto. "If it's alien, it's ours.” Anything that comes from the sky, we strip it down and we use it, for the good of the British Empire.
For the good of the what?
The British Empire.
There isn't a British Empire.
Not yet.
Ah, excuse me. Now, if you wouldn't mind.
Do you recognise this, Doctor?
That's a particle gun.
Good, isn't it?
Took us eight years to get it to work.
It's the 21st century, you can't have particle guns.
We must defend our border against the alien.
Thank you, Sebastian, isn’t it?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Sebastian.
I think it's very important to know everyone by name.
Torchwood is a very modern organisation.
People skills. That's what it’s all about these days.
I'm a people person.
Have you got anyone called Alonso?
I don't think so. Is that important?
I suppose not. What was your name?
Yvonne, Yvonne Hartman.
Ah, yes. Now, we're rather fond of these.
The Magna-clamp, found in a spaceship, buried at the base of Mount Snowdon.
Attach this to an object and it cancels the mass.
I could use it to lift two tons of weight with a single hand.
That's an imperial ton, by the way. Torchwood refuses to go metric.
I could do with that to carry the shopping.
All these devices are for Torchwood's benefit, not the general public's.
So what about these ghosts?
Ah, yes, the ghosts.
They're what you might call a side effect.
Of what?
All in good time, Doctor. There is an itinerary, trust me.
Oi, where are you taking that?
If it's alien, it's ours.
You'll never get inside it.
(SNICKERING) Etcetera.
Psychic paper, psychic paper...
All those times I've been on Earth, I've never heard of you.
Well, of course not. You're the enemy.
You're actually named in the Torchwood Foundation Charter of 1879 as an enemy of the Crown.
1879? That was called Torchwood, that house in Scotland.
That's right. Where you encountered Queen Victoria and the werewolf.
I think he makes half of it up.
Her Majesty created the Torchwood Institute with the express intention of keeping Britain great and fighting the alien horde.
But if I'm the enemy, does that mean I'm a prisoner?
Oh, yes.
But we'll make you perfectly comfortable.
And there is so much you can teach us.
Starting with this.
Now, what do you make of that?
You must be the Doctor.
Rajesh Singh. It's an honour, sir.
Yeah.
What is that thing?
We got no idea.
JACKIE: What's wrong with it?
What makes you think there's something wrong with it?
I don't know. It just feels weird.
The Sphere has that effect on everyone.
Makes you want to run and hide. Like it's forbidden.
We've tried analysing it, using every device imaginable.
But according to our instruments, the Sphere doesn't exist.
It weighs nothing. It doesn't age.
No heat, no radiation and has no atomic mass.
I can see it.
Fascinating, isn't it?
It upsets people because it gives off nothing.
It is absent.
Well, Doctor?
This is a Void ship.
And what is that?
Well, it's impossible, for starters.
I always thought it was just a theory, but...
It's a vessel designed to exist outside time and space.
Travelling through the Void.
And what's "the Void"?
The space between dimensions.
There's all sorts of realities around us, different dimensions, billions of parallel universes, all stacked up against each other.
The Void is the space in-between, containing absolutely nothing.
Can you imagine that? Nothing.
No light, no dark, no up, no down. No life. No time.
Without end.
My people called it the Void, the Eternals called it the Howling, but some people call it hell.
But someone built the Sphere. What for?
Why go there?
To explore. To escape.
You could sit inside that thing and eternity would pass you by.
Big Bang, end of the universe, start of the next, wouldn't even touch the sides, You'd exist outside the whole of creation.
You see, we were right. There is something inside it.
Oh, yes.
So how do we get in there?
We don't!
We send that thing back into hell! How did it get here in the first place?
Well, that's how it all started, The Sphere came through into this world, and the ghosts followed in its wake.
Show me.
No, Doctor!
I don't get it. What is it? What am I supposed to be looking for?
Just go to the left.
Yvonne's gonna be back any minute.
Just go to the left.
What, you mean in here?
(MATT SCREAMING) (MEN CHATTERING) The Sphere came through here.
A hole in the world.
Not active at the moment.
But when we fire particle engines at that exact spot, the breach opens up.
How did you even find it?
We were getting warning signs for years, a radar black spot.
So we built this place, Torchwood Tower.
The breach was 600 feet above sea level. It was the only way to reach it.
You built a skyscraper just to reach a spatial disturbance?
How much money have you got?
Enough.
Hold on a minute. We're in Canary Wharf.
Must be. This building, it's Canary Wharf.
Well, that is the public name for it. But to those in the know, it's Torchwood.
So, you find the breach, probe it, the Sphere comes through 600 feet above London, bam!
It leaves a hole in the fabric of reality.
And that hole, you think, "Oh, shall we leave it alone?
"Shall we back off? Should we play it safe?” Nah! You think, “Let's make it bigger!" It's a massive source of energy.
If we can harness that power, we need never depend on the Middle East again.
Britain will become truly independent.
You can see for yourself, the next Ghost Shift's in two minutes.
Cancel it.
I don't think so.
I'm warning you. Cancel it!
Oh, exactly as the legends would have it.
The Doctor, lording it over us. Assuming alien authority over the rights of man.
Let me show you.
Sphere comes through.
But when it made the hole, it cracked the world around it.
The entire surface of this dimension, splintered.
And that's how the ghosts get through, that's how they get everywhere.
They're bleeding through the fault lines.
Walking from their world, across the Void and into yours.
With the human race hoping and wishing and helping them along.
But too many ghosts and...
Well, in that case, we'll have to be more careful.
Positions! Ghost Shift in one minute.
Miss Hartman, I am asking you, please don't do it.
We have done this a thousand times.
Then stop at a thousand!
We're in control of the ghosts.
The levers can open the breach, but equally they can close it.
Okay.
Sorry?
Never mind. As you were.
What, is that it?
No, fair enough. I've said my bit. Don't mind me.
Any chance of a cup of tea?
Ghost Shift in 20 seconds.
Mmm, can't wait to see it!
You can't stop us, Doctor.
No, absolutely not. Pull up a chair, Rose. Come and watch the fireworks.
Ghost Shift in 10 seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
Stop the shift! I said, stop!
Thank you.
I suppose it makes sense to get as much intelligence as possible.
But the programme will recommence as soon as you've explained everything.
I'm glad to be of help.
And someone clear up this glass.
They did warn me, Doctor. They said you liked to make a mess.
(TYPING) (BEEPING) Can I help you?
I was just...
Try not to look. It does that to everyone.
What do you want?
Sorry, um...
They sent me from personnel. They said some man had been taken prisoner.
Some sort of doctor?
I'm just checking the lines of communication.
Did they tell you anything?
Can I see your authorisation?
Sure.
Well, that's lucky.
You see, everyone at Torchwood has at least a basic level of psychic training.
This paper is blank. And you're a fake.
Seal the room. Call security.
(DOOR BANGING SHUT) Samuel, can you check the door locks? She just walked right in.
Doing it now, sir.
Well, if you'd like to take a seat.
So these ghosts, whatever they are, did they build the Sphere?
Must have. Aimed it at this dimension like a cannonball.
RAJESH: Yvonne, I think you should see this. We've got a visitor.
Don't know who she is, but funnily enough, she arrived at the same time as the Doctor.
She one of yours?
Never seen her before in my life.
Good, then we can have her shot.
Oh, all right, then, it was worth a try. That's...
That's Rose Tyler.
Sorry. Hello.
Well, if that's Rose Tyler, who's she?
I'm her mother.
Oh, you travel with her mother?
He kidnapped me.
Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother.
Charming.
I've got a reputation to uphold.
Excuse me, everyone. I thought I said stop the Ghost Shift.
Who started the programme?
I ordered you to stop. Who's doing that?
Right, step away from your monitors, everyone!
Gareth! Adi! Stop what you're doing, right now!
Matt! Step away from your desk! That's an order!
Stop the levers! Andrew! Stop the levers!
What's she doing?
Adi, step away from the desk.
Listen to me, step away from the desk!
She can't hear you.
They're overriding the system.
We're going into Ghost Shift.
Yvonne, I thought you said the next Ghost Shift was cancelled?
What's going on? Yvonne?
(LOUD THUD) RAJESH: It can't be.
(LOUD THUD) RAJESH: It's active!
It's the earpiece controlling them.
I've seen this before.
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
(ALL SCREAMING) What happened? What did you just do?
They're dead.
You killed them?
Oh, someone else did that long before I got here.
But you killed them!
Jackie, I haven't got time for this!
What are those earpieces? Don't.
But they're standard comms devices. How does it control them?
Trust me, leave them alone.
But what are they?
(GROANS) Oh God!
It goes inside their brain!
What about the Ghost Shift?
90% and still running.
~Can't you stop it?
They're still controlling it.
They've hijacked the system.
Who's "they"?
Might be a remote transmitter but it's got to be close by. I can trace it.
Jackie, stay here!
YVONNE: Keep those levers down! Keep them offline!
We've got a problem down here.
Yvonne, can you hear me?
Yvonne, for God's sake, the Sphere is active!
The readings are going wild!
It's got weight, it's got mass, an electromagnetic field. It exists!
(DOOR BANGING SHUT) The door's sealed! Automatic quarantine! We... We can't get out!
It's all right, babe. We've beaten them before, we can beat them again.
That why I'm here. The fight goes on.
The fight against what?
What do you think?
(BEEPING) You two! You come with us, yeah.
This way.
What's down here?
What? I don't know.
I think it's building work. It's just renovations.
You should go back.
Think again.
(BEEPING) What is it? What's down here?
Earpieces, ear pods... This world is colliding with another.
And I think I know which one.
What are they?
They came through first.
The advance guard.
Cybermen.
(LOUD THUD) We had them beaten, but then they escaped.
The Cybermen just vanished.
They found their way through to this world, but so did we.
The Doctor said that was impossible.
Yeah, it's not the first time he's been wrong.
What's inside that Sphere?
No one knows. Cyber leader, Cyber King, Emperor of the Cybermen.
Whatever it is, he's dead meat.
It's good to see you.
Yeah. It's good to see you, too.
DOCTOR: Get away from the machines! Do what they say! Don’t fight them!
Don't shoot!
What are they?
We are the Cybermen.
The Ghost Shift will be increased to 100%.
(WHIRRING) COMPUTER: Online.
Here come the ghosts.
It's extraordinary! There are more ghosts than we've ever seen before, and it's happening all over the world.
As far as we know, the increase in ghost activity is harmless.
Can anyone hear me?
Come on, I need help down here! I need...
(THUDDING) Here we go.
But these Cybermen, what have they got to do with the ghosts?
Don't you ever listen? “A footprint doesn't look like a boot.” Achieving full transfer.
They're Cybermen.
All of the ghosts are Cybermen.
Millions of them.
Right across the world.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) They're not ghosts. They're metal men!
I urge you, stay in your homes!
(ALL SCREAMING) They're invading the whole planet.
It's not an invasion. It's too late for that.
It's a victory.
(BEEPING) COMPUTER: Sphere activated. Sphere activated.
Sphere activated. Sphere activated.
I know what's in there, and I'm ready for them. I've got just the thing.
This is gonna blast them to hell.
Samuel, what are you doing?
The name's Mickey. Mickey Smith.
Defending the Earth.
I don't understand. The Cybermen don't have the technology to build a Void ship.
That's way beyond you. How did you create that Sphere?
The Sphere is not ours.
What?
The Sphere broke down the barriers between worlds, We only followed.
Its origin is unknown.
Then what's inside it?
Rose is down there!
That's not Cybermen.
Oh my God!
Location, Earth. Life forms detected.
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate!
This planet is starting to boil!
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
My name is Rose Tyler.
And this is the story of Torchwood.
The last story I'll ever tell.
Here we are, then. Dad, say hello to Rose.
Hasn't she grown?
Welcome to Torchwood.
They're Cybermen.
All of the ghosts are Cybermen.
MICKEY: That's not Cybermen. ROSE: Oh, my God!
Exterminate! Exterminate!
This is the story of how I died.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) ALL: Exterminate.
Daleks!
You're called Daleks!
I know your name.
Think about it, how can I know that?
A human who knows about the Daleks and the Time War.
If you want to know how, then keep us alive. That's all I'm asking.
Me and my friends.
Yeah, Daleks, Time War, me, too.
Yeah, and me.
You will be necessary.
Report! What is the status of the Genesis Ark?
Status, hibernation.
Commence awakening.
The Genesis Ark must be protected above all else.
The Daleks? You said they were all dead.
Never mind that. What the hell's a "Genesis Ark"?
What's down there?
She was in that room, with the Sphere.
What's happened to Rose?
I don't know.
I'll find her.
I brought you here. I'll get you both out, you and your daughter.
Jackie, look at me.
Look at me!
I promise you.
I give you my word.
You will talk to your Central World Authority and order global surrender.
Oh, do some research.
We haven't got a “Central World Authority".
You have now.
I will speak on all global wavelengths.
This broadcast is for humankind.
The Cybermen now occupy every landmass on this planet.
But you need not fear.
Cybermen will remove fear.
Cybermen will remove sex and class and colour and creed.
You will become identical.
You will become like us.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) SOLDIER: Attack!
I ordered surrender.
They're not taking instructions.
Don't you understand? You're on every street!
You're in their homes! You've got their children!
Of course they're going to fight!
Which of you is least important?
What's that supposed to mean?
Which of you is least important?
No. We don't work like that. None of us.
Designate the least important.
This is my responsibility.
No, don't...
I, er...
I represent the Torchwood Institute. Anything you need, you come through me.
Leave these two alone.
You will kneel.
What for?
Kneel!
The Daleks need information about current Earth history.
Yeah, well, I can give you a certain amount of intelligence, but nothing that will compromise homeland security...
Speech is not necessary.
We will extract brainwaves.
Don't. I'll tell you everything you need.
No, don't.
Scans detect unknown technology active within Sphere Chamber.
Cybermen will investigate.
Units 10-6-5 and 10-6-6 will investigate Sphere Chamber.
We obey.
His mind spoke of a second species invading Earth, Infected by the superstition of ghosts.
You didn't need to kill him!
Neither did we need him alive!
Dalek Thay, investigate outside.
I obey.

Establish visual contact, lower communications barrier.
(MARCHING) DALEK: Identify yourselves, CYBERMAN: You will identify first.
DALEK: State your identity!
CYBERMAN: You will identify first.
DALEK: Identify!
It's like Stephen Hawking meets the speaking clock.
.. and illogical, you will modify.
Daleks do not take orders.
You have identified as Daleks.
Outline resembles the inferior species known as Cybermen, Rose said about the Daleks, she was terrified of them.
What have they done to her, Doctor? Is she dead?
(WHISPERING) Phone.
What?
Phone.
(CYBERMEN AND DALEKS ARGUING) (PHONE RINGING) DALEK: ... crude cybernetic constructs on worldwide scale.
She's answered. She's alive. But why haven't they killed her?
Well, don't complain.
They must need her for something.
We must protect the Genesis Ark.
"Genesis Ark"?
Our species are similar, though your design is inelegant.
Daleks have no concept of elegance.
This is obvious.
But consider. Our technologies are compatible.
Cybermen plus Daleks, together we could upgrade the universe.
You propose an alliance?
This is correct.
Request denied.
Hostile elements will be deleted.
DALEK: Exterminate.
CYBERMAN: Open visual link.
Daleks, be warned.
You have declared war upon the Cybermen.
This is not war. This is pest control.
We have five million Cybermen.
How many are you?
Four.
You would destroy the Cybermen with four Daleks?
We would destroy the Cybermen with one Dalek.
You are superior in only one respect.
What is that?
You are better at dying.
Raise communications barrier.
DALEK: Wait, Lost her.
Rewind image by nine rels.
Identify grid Seven Gamma Flame.
This male registers as enemy.
The female's heartbeat has increased.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Identify him!
All right, then.
If you really want to know.
That's the Doctor.
Five million Cybermen, easy.
One Doctor? Now you're scared.
Quarantine the Sphere Chamber. Start emergency upgrading.
Begin with these personnel.
No, you can't do this! We've surrendered! We've surrendered!
Keep this one.
His increased adrenaline suggests that he has vital Dalek information.
~Stop them! I don't want to go! Doctor!
I demand you leave that woman alone.
You promised me. You gave me your word.
I won't help you unless you leave that woman alone. Jackie, don't fight them...
Cyberthreat irrelevant. Concentrate on the Genesis Ark.
Why are we being kept alive?
They might need me.
What?
What is it?
(MAN SCREAMING) What happens in there?
What's upgrading mean? What do they do?
I think they remove the brain.
Sorry. I think they remove the brain and they put it into a suit of armour.
That's what these things are.
They're us. “Next.
This is your fault. You and your Torchwood!
You've killed us all!
I did my duty. For Queen and Country.
I did my duty.
I did my duty.
Oh, God.
I did my duty.
(YVONNE SCREAMING) You are proof. ~Of what?
That emotions destroy you.
Yeah, I am.
Mind you, I quite like hope.
Hope's a good emotion.
And here it comes.
(SHOUTING ORDERS) Doctor. Good to see you again.
Jake?
The Cybermen came through from one world to another, and so did we.
No!
(WOMAN SCREAMING) Cyberleader One has been terminated.
Explain. Download shared files.
I will be upgraded to Cyberleader.
Defend this room.
Chrissie, monitor communications.
Kill one Cyberleader and they just download into another.
Move!
You can't just hop from one world to another. You can't.
We just did. With these.
But that’s impossible. You can't have this sort of technology.
We've got our own version of Torchwood. They developed it.
Do you wanna come and see?
No!
Parallel Earth, parallel Torchwood.
Except we found out what the Institute was doing, and the People's Republic took control.
I've got to get back. Rose is in danger, and her mother.
That would be Jackie.
My wife in a parallel universe.
And as for you, Doctor. At least this time, I know who you are.
Right, yes, fine, hooray, but I've got to get back, right now.
No, you're not in charge here.
This is our world, not yours. And you're going to listen for once.
I could transport out of here, but it only carries one.
And I'm not leaving you.
Follow me anywhere.
What did I do to you all those years ago?
Guess I'm just stupid.
You're the bravest man I've ever met.
What about the Doctor?
Oh, all right.
Bravest human.
Well, I can't think what the Daleks need with me.
I'm nothing to them.
You could be.
Whatever's inside that Ark, it's waking up. And I've seen this happen before.
First time I saw a Dalek, it was broken.
It was dying. But I touched it And the moment I did that, I brought it back to life.
So the Doctor said, when you travel in time, in the Tardis, you soak up all this...
background radiation.
It's harmless, it’s just there.
But in the Time War, the Daleks evolved so they could use it as a power supply.
I love it when you talk technical.
Shut up.
But if the Daleks have got something inside that thing and it needs waking up...
They need you.
You've travelled in time. Either one of us would do.
But why would they build something they can’t open themselves?
The technology is stolen.
The Ark is not of Dalek design.
Then who built it?
The Time Lords.
This is all that survives of their home world.
But what's inside?
The future.
When you left this world, you warned us there'd be more Cybermen.
So we sealed them inside the factories.
Except people argued.
Said they were living, we should help them.
And the debate went on, but all that time, the Cybermen made plans.
Infiltrated this version of Torchwood.
Mapped themselves onto your world and then vanished.
When was this?
Three years ago.
It's taken them three years to cross the Void, but we can pop to and fro in a second?
Must be the sheer mass of five million Cybermen crossing all at once.
Yeah. Mickey said you'd rattle off that sort of stuff.
Where is the Mickey boy?
He went ahead first.
Any chance to go and find Miss Rose Tyler.
She's your daughter.
You do know that? Did Mickey explain? She's not mine.
She's the child of a dead man.
Look at it. A world at peace.
We're calling this the Golden Age.
Who's the president now?
A woman called Harriet Jones.
I'd keep an eye on her.
But it's a lie.
Temperatures have risen by two degrees in the past six months.
The ice caps are melting. They're saying all of this is gonna be flooded.
That's not just global warming, is it?
No.
It's the breach.
I've been trying to tell you. Travel between parallel worlds is impossible.
Then the Daleks break down the walls with the Sphere.
"Daleks"?
Then the Cybermen travelled across, then you lot, those discs, every time you jump from one reality to another, you rip a hole in the universe.
This planet is starting to boil!
Keep going and both worlds will fall into the Void.
But you can stop it?
The famous Doctor.
You can seal the breach.
Leaving five million Cybermen stranded on my Earth.
That's your problem. I'm protecting this world and this world only.
Pete Tyler.
I knew you when you were dead.
Now here you are, fighting the fight.
Alone.
There is a chance.
Back on my world, Jackie Tyler might still be alive.
My wife died.
Her husband died. Good match.
There's more important things at stake.
Doctor.
Help us.
What? Close the breach?
Stop the Cybermen? Defeat the Daleks?
Do you believe I can do that?
Yes.
Maybe, that's all I need.
Off we go, then.
First of all, I need to make a phone call. You don't mind?
You two, guard the door.
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING) Oh, my God, help me.
Jackie, you're alive.
They tried to download me but I ran away.
Listen, tell me, where are you?
I don't know. Staircase, Yeah, which one? Is there any sort of sign, anything to identify it?
Yes, a fire extinguisher.
Yeah, that helps.
Oh, wait a minute. It says N3.
North corner, staircase three. Just keep low, we're trying our best.
Oh, don't leave me.
I've got to go. I'm sorry.
Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Tyler.
She's not my wife.
I was at the wedding. You got her name wrong.
Now, Jakey-boy. If I could open the bonding chamber on this thing, it could work on polycarbide.
What's "polycarbide"? The skin of a Dalek.
Sorry. No white flag, only had a sheet of A4. Same difference.
Do you surrender?
I surrender, unto you...
a very good idea.
Final stage of awakening!
Your handprint will open the Ark.
Well tough, ‘cause I'm not doing it.
Obey or the male will die.
I can’t let them...
Rose, don't!
Place your hand upon the casket.
All right!
But you're gonna kill us anyway, so what the hell.
If you, erm...
escaped the Time War, don't you want to know what happened?
Place your hand...
What happened to the Emperor?
The Emperor survived?
Until he met me.
‘Cause if these are gonna be my last words, then you're gonna listen.
I met the Emperor.
And I took the Time Vortex and poured it into his head and turned him into dust.
Did you get that?
The God of all Daleks and I destroyed him.
You will be exterminated!
Oh, now, hold on, wait a minute...
Alert. Alert. You are the Doctor.
Sensors report he is unarmed.
That's me. Always.
Then you are powerless, Not me. Never.
How are you?
Oh. Same old, you know.
Good. And Micketty-Mick-Mickey, nice to see you.
And you, boss.
Social interaction will cease.
How did you survive the Time War?
By fighting. On the front line.
I was there at the Fall of Arcadia.
Some day, I might even come to terms with that.
But you lot ran away.
We had to survive, The last four Daleks in existence.
~So what's so special about you?
Doctor, they've got names.
I mean, Daleks don't have names, do they? But one of them said...
I am Dalek Thay.
Dalek Sec.
Dalek fast.
Dalek Caan.
So that's it. At last.
The Cult of Skaro. I thought you were just a legend.
Who are they?
A secret order, above and beyond the Emperor himself.
Their job was to imagine.
Think as the enemy thinks.
Even dare to have names, all to find new ways of killing.
But that thing, they said it was yours. I mean Time Lords, they built it, what does it do?
I don't know. Never seen it before.
But it's Time Lord.
Both sides had secrets. What is it, what have you done?
Time Lord science will restore Dalek supremacy.
What does that mean? What sort of “Time Lord science"? What do you mean?
They said one touch from a time traveller will wake it up.
Technology using the one thing a Dalek can't do.
Touch.
Sealed inside your casing, not feeling anything, ever.
From birth to death, locked inside a cold metal cage, completely alone.
That explains your voice, No wonder you scream.
The Doctor will open the Ark!
(CHUCKLING) The Doctor will not.
You have no way of resisting.
Well, you got me there. Although...
there is always this.
A sonic probe?
That's screwdriver.
It is harmless, Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word. That's why I like it.
Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim, but I'll tell you what it does do.
It is very good at opening doors.
CYBERMAN: Terminate. Terminate.
Alert. Casing impaired, casing impaired.
Rose, get out.
DALEK: Firepower insufficient, firepower insufficient.
Come on.
CYBERMAN: Daleks will be deleted. Delete, delete.
Mickey, come on.
DALEK: Adapt to weaponry.
Firepower restored.
Cybermen, primary target.
Jake, protect the stairwell. The rest of you, come on.
Cybermen have been exterminated. Daleks are supreme.
The Genesis Ark is primed.
The Ark needs area of thirty square miles.
Move.
Genesis Ark mobile.
I just fell, I didn't mean it.
Mickey, without us, they'd have opened it by force, and to do that, they'd have blown up the sun, so you've done us a favour.
Now, run.
You will be upgraded.
No, but you can't...
Pete?
Hello, Jacks.
I said there were ghosts. But that's not fair. Why him?
I'm not a ghost.
But you're dead.
You died 20 years ago, Pete.
It's Pete from a different universe, There are parallel worlds, Jackie.
Every single decision we make creates a parallel existence, a different dimension where...
Oh, you can shut up.
You look old.
You don't.
How can you be standing there?
Just got lucky.
Lived my life.
But you were left on your own.
You didn’t marry again or...?
There was never anyone else.
Twenty years, though. Look at me. I never left that flat.
Did nothing with myself.
You brought her up.
Rose Tyler.
That's not bad.
Yeah.
In my world, it worked.
All those daft little plans of mine, it worked.
Made me rich.
I don't care about that.
How rich? Very.
I don't care about that.
How very?
Thing is though, Jacks, you're not my wife.
I'm sorry, but you're not. I mean we both...
You know, it's just sort of...
Oh, come here.
Exterminate.
Delete.
Exterminate.
Delete, delete.
Exterminate.
Delete, delete.
Exterminate.
Exterminate.
Delete, (MEN SHOUTING) Emergency, all units will converge on the Torchwood Tower.
Repeat, all Cybermen to Torchwood.
Come on, please.
Override roof mechanism.
Elevate, What are they doing? Why do they need to get outside?
Time Lord science. What Time Lord science, what is it?
We've got to see what it's doing, we've got to go back up.
Come on, all of you. Top floor!
That's 45 floors up. Believe me, I've done them all.
We could always take the Lift.
The Genesis Ark will open.
Time Lord science.
It's bigger on the inside.
The Time Lords put those Daleks in there?
What for?
It's a prison ship.
How many Daleks?
Millions, Exterminate all life forms below. Exterminate.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) I'm sorry, but you've had it. This world's going to crash and burn.
There's nothing we can do.
We're going home. Jacks, take this.
You're coming with us.
But they're destroying the city.
Oh, I'd forgotten you could argue. It's not just London. It's the whole world.
But there's another world, just waiting for you, Jacks, and it's safe.
As long as the Doctor closes the breach.
Doctor?
Oh, I'm ready.
I've got the equipment right here, thank you, Torchwood.
Slam it down and close off both universes.
But we can't just leave. What about the Daleks? And the Cybermen?
They're part of the problem and that makes them part of the solution. Oh, yes.
Well? Isn't anyone going to ask? What is it with the glasses?
What is it with the glasses?
I can see. That's what.
‘Cause we've got two separate worlds, but in between the two separate worlds, we've got the Void, that's where the Daleks were hiding, and the Cybermen travelled through the Void to get here and you lot, one world to another, via the Void.
I like that, "via the Void", Look.
I've been through it, do you see?
COMPUTER: Reboot in three minutes.
What is it? Void stuff.
Like background radiation. That's it.
Look at the others, And the only one who hasn't been through the Void, your mother.
First time she's looked normal in her life.
Oi.
But the Daleks lived inside the Void. They're bristling with it.
Cybermen, all of them, I just open the Void. And reverse.
The Void stuff gets sucked back inside.
Pulling them all in.
Pulling them all in.
~Sorry, but what's the Void?
The dead space.
Some people call it hell.
So you're sending the Daleks and the Cybermen to hell?
Man, I told you he was good.
But it's like you said. We've all got Void stuff.
Me, too, ‘cause we went to that parallel world.
We're all contaminated. We'll get pulled in.
That's why you've got to go.
COMPUTER: Reboot in two minutes.
Back to Pete's world. Hey, we should call it that. "Pete's World”.
I'm opening the Void, but only on this side.
You'll be safe on that side.
And then you close it? For good?
The breach itself is soaked in Void stuff. In the end, it'll close itself.
And that's it. Kaput.
But you stay on this side?
But you'll get pulled in.
That's why I got these.
I'll just have to hold on tight. Been doing it all my life.
I'm supposed to go?
Yeah.
To another world? And then it gets sealed off?
Yeah.
Forever?
(SCOFFING) That's not gonna happen.
We haven't got time to argue. The plan works, We're going.
You, too, all of us. I'm not leaving him.
I'm not going without her.
Oh, my God, we're going.
I've had 20 years without you, so button it.
I'm not leaving her!
But you've got to.
Well, that's tough.
Mum.
COMPUTER: Reboot in one minute.
I had a life with you for 19 years.
But then I met the Doctor.
And all the things I've seen him do for me, for you, for all of us, for the whole stupid planet and every planet out there. He does it alone, Mum.
But not anymore.
‘Cause now he's got me.
Oh, no, you don't.
He's not doing that to me again.
I think this is the on switch.
But I've got to go back.
The Doctor said, every time we use one of these, it damages the whole world.
Now that's it.
She's your daughter.
She's your daughter, not mine. That's an order.
Mickey, tell him. Tell him, Mickey! Mickey!
Once the breach collapses, that's it. You'll never be able to see her again.
Your own mother!
I made my choice a long time ago. And I'm never going to leave you.
So, what can I do to help?
COMPUTER: Systems rebooted. Open access.
Those coordinates over there, set them all at six. And hurry up.
Get away from me.
We've got Cybermen on the way up.
How many floors down?
Just one.
We will retreat through the breach.
Regain the home world.
FEMALE VOICE: You will not pass.
What is the meaning of this?
You will not pass.
(CYBERMEN SHOUTING) I did my duty. For Queen and Country.
I did my duty. For Queen and Country.
I did my duty. For Queen and Country.
COMPUTER: Levers operational.
That's more like it. Bit of a smile.
The old team.
Hope and Glory.
Mutt and Jeff. Shiver and Shake.
Which one's Shiver?
Oh, I'm Shake.
Press the red button.
Breach active. It is the Doctor. Exterminate him.
Exterminate!
When it starts, just hold on tight. Shouldn't be too bad for us, but the Daleks and the Cybermen are steeped in Void stuff. Are you ready?
So are they.
Let's do it.
COMPUTER: Online.
(DALEKS SCREAMING) The breach is open. Into the Void!
(CYBERMEN AND DALEKS SHOUTING) Emergency temporal shift.
COMPUTER: Offline.
Hold on!
I've got to get it upright.
COMPUTER: Online and locked.
Rose. Hold on!
Hold on!
No!
COMPUTER: Systems closed.
Take me back. Take me back.
Take me back.
It's stopped working.
He did it.
He closed the breach.
DOCTOR: Rose, ROSE: Last night I had a dream.
DOCTOR: Rose, ROSE: I heard a voice. And it was calling my name.
DOCTOR: Rose, Rose.
Rose.
I had a dream.
I told Mum and Dad and Mickey.
Anyone else would think I was mad, but not those three.
They believed it.
Because they've met the Doctor. So they listened to the dream.
He was calling me, and...
And that night, we packed up.
Got into Dad's old Jeep. And off we went.
Just like the dream said, We followed the voice.
Crossed the water, kept on driving, hundreds and hundreds of mile.
Because he's calling.
DOCTOR: Rose, Here I am, at last.
And this is the story of how I died.
Where are you?
Inside the Tardis.
There's one tiny little gap in the universe Left.
Just about to close.
And it takes a lot of power to send this projection.
I'm in orbit around a supernova.
I'm burning up a sun just to say goodbye.
You look like a ghost.
Hold on.
Can I...?
I'm still just an image. No touch.
~Can't you come through properly?
The whole thing would fracture.
Two universes would collapse. So?
Where are we? Where did the gap come out?
We're in Norway.
Norway. Right.
About 50 miles out of Bergen, it's called Darlig Ulv Stranden.
Dalek?
Dérlig. It's Norwegian for bad.
This translates as Bad Wolf Bay.
How long have we got?
About two minutes, I can't think of what to say.
You've still got Mr Mickey, then.
There's five of us now.
Mum, Dad, Mickey and the baby.
You're not...
No. It's Mum.
She's three months gone. More Tylers on the way.
And what about you, what are you...
Yeah, I'm back working in the shop.
Well, good for you.
Shut up.
Nah, I'm not.
There's still a Torchwood on this planet. It's open for business.
I think I know a thing or two about aliens.
Rose Tyler. Defender of the Earth.
You're dead, officially. Back home.
So many people died that day and you've gone missing.
You're on a list of the dead.
But here you are, living a life, day after day.
The one adventure I can never have, Am I ever going to see you again?
You can't.
What are you going to do?
I've got the Tardis.
Same old life. Last of the Time Lords.
On your own?
 I love you.
Quite right, too.
And I suppose...
if it's my last chance to say it, Rose Tyler...
What?
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Sorry.
(WHIRRING) (SCREAMING) WOMAN: Where did she go?
What?
What?
What?
Who are you?
But...
Where am I?
What?
What the hell is this place?
What?
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) You can't do that, I wasn't...
We're in flight! That is physically impossible. How did...
Tell me where I am. I demand you tell me right now, where am I?
Inside the Tardis.
What?
The Tardis.
What?
The Tardis!
The what?
It's called the Tardis.
That's not even a proper word!
You're just saying things.
How did you get in here?
Well, obviously, when you kidnapped me.
Who was it? Who's paying you? Was it Nerys?
Oh, my God, she's finally got me back.
This has got Nerys written all over it.
Who the hell is Nerys?
Your best friend.
Hold on, wait a minute.
What are you dressed like that for?
I'm going ten-pin bowling.
Why do you think, dumbo?
I was halfway up the aisle! I've waited all my life for this.
I was just seconds away and then you, I don't know, you drugged me or something.
I haven't done anything.
I'm having the police on you.
Me and my husband, as soon as he is my husband, we're gonna sue the living backside off you.
No! Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't!
You're in space.
Outer space. This is my... spaceship.
It's called the Tardis.
How am I breathing?
The Tardis is protecting us.
Who are you?
I'm the Doctor. You?
Donna.
Human?
Yeah.
Is that optional?
Well, it is for me.
You're an alien?
Yeah.
It's freezing with these doors open.
I don't understand it and I understand everything. This can't happen.
There is no way a human being can lock itself onto the Tardis and transport itself inside. It must be...
There's some sort of subatomic connection, something like a temporal field.
Maybe something pulling you into alignment with the chronon shell.
Maybe it's something macrobudding your DNA with the interior matrix.
Maybe a genetic...
What was that for?
(SHOUTING) Get me to the church!
Right, fine. I don't want you here anyway. Where is this wedding?
St Mary's, Haven Road, Chiswick, London, England, Earth, the solar system.
I knew it, acting all innocent. I'm not the first, am I?
How many women have you abducted?
That's my friend's.
Where is she, then?
Popped out for a spacewalk?
She's gone.
Gone where?
I lost her.
Well, you can hurry up and lose me.
How do you mean, lost?
Right. Chiswick.
No, she didn't run away.
We're not talking jitters, she literally vanished.
Now go and check the house and she if she's there, Oh, Angelica, that's not helping, is it? Now smarten up.
Lance, any sign? I've looked all around, I can't find her.
Where the hell did she go?
Showing off, that's what she is.
First day at school, she was sent home for biting.
It's a bit more serious than that.
~She's never disappeared before.
She didn't disappear, it’s a trick.
It's one of her silly little look-at-me party pieces.
What if she's dead?
Oh, don't say that.
I said St Mary's. What sort of Martian are you?
Where’s this?
Something's wrong with her.
It's like she’s recalibrating.
She's digesting. What is it? What have you eaten? What's wrong?
Donna, you've really got to think. Is there anything that might have caused this?
Anything you might have done?
Any sort of alien contact? I can't let you go wandering off. What if you're dangerous?
I mean, have you seen lights in the sky or did you touch something, like, something different?
Something strange or something made out of a piece of metal?
Who are you getting married to? Sure he's human?
He's not a bit overweight with a zip round his forehead, is he?
Donna!
Donna.
Leave me alone, I just want to get married.
~Come back to the Tardis.
No way, that box is too weird.
It's bigger on the inside, that's all.
Oh, that's all?
3:10. I'm gonna miss it.
Why don't you phone them? Tell them where you are.
How do I do that?
Haven't you got a mobile?
I'm in my wedding dress, it doesn't have pockets. Who has pockets?
Have you ever seen a bride with pockets?
When I went to my fitting at Chez Alison, the one thing I forgot to say was, “Give me pockets.” This man you're marrying, what's his name?
Lance.
Good luck, Lance.
0i.
No stupid Martian is going to stop me from getting married, to hell with you.
I'm not... I'm not... I'm not from Mars.
Taxi!
He had his light on!
There's another one.
Taxi.
Oi!
There's one.
Oi!
Do you have this effect on everyone? Why aren't they stopping?
They think I'm in fancy dress.
~Get off the sauce, darling!
They think I'm drunk.
You're fooling no one, mate.
They think I'm in drag.
Hold on, hold on.
St Mary's in Chiswick, just off Haven Road.
It's an emergency. I'm getting married, just hurry up.
That'll cost you, sweetheart. Double rates today.
Oh, my God! Have you got any money?
Erm... no. Haven't you?
Pockets?
And that goes double for your mother!
I'll have him. I've got his number, I'll have him.
Talk about the Christmas spirit.
Is it Christmas?
Well, duh!
Maybe not on Mars but here it's Christmas Eve.
Phone box! We can reverse the charges.
How come you're getting married on Christmas Eve?
Can't bear it, I hate Christmas. Honeymoon, Morocco. Sunshine, lovely.
What's the operator? I've not done this in years. What do you dial? 100?
Just call direct.
What did you do?
Something... Martian. Now phone, I'll get money.
Oh, answer the phone!
Hello?
Oh, no! The battery's gone dead. Has anyone got a charger?
Did you try the hotel? Hello? Hello?
Vicar, is your phone working? Mine's run out.
I've got one wedding about to arrive and another wedding refusing to leave so, yes, I do think it's a police matter.
Mum, get off the phone and listen, I'm in...
Oh, my God, I don't know where I am, it's a street.
And there's WHSmith. But it's definitely Earth.
(BEEPING) Excuse me, I'm begging you.
I'm getting married, | really am, and I'm late and I just need to borrow a tenner and I'll pay you back, I promise, and it's Christmas, DONNA: Taxi!
I want to go to Chiswick.
Thanks for nothing, Spaceman, I'll see you in court.
Donna!
I promise you, mate, I'll give you the rest when we get there.
Oh, I look a mess.
Hurry up.
Hold on a minute, I said Chiswick. You've missed the turning.
Excuse me, we should have turned off back there. We're going the wrong way.
(HORN BLARING) What the hell are you doing? I'm late for the wedding!
My own wedding, do you get that?
Turn around! Turn this cab around right now!
Are you deaf or what?
Oh, my God!
Help me! Help me!
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Help me! Help me!
Help me! Get me out. Help me!
Help me, I'm being driven by a robot!
Behave!
You are kidding me.
Open the door!
Do what?
Open the door!
I can't, it's locked.
Santa's a robot.
Donna, open the door.
What for?
You've got to jump.
I'm a blinking bit jumpy! I'm supposed to be getting married.
Listen to me, you've got to jump.
I'm not jumping on a motorway.
Whatever that thing is, it needs you and whatever it needs you for, it's not good.
Now, come on.
I'm in my wedding dress!
Yes, you look lovely. Come on.
Oh!
I can't do it.
Trust me.
Is that what you said to her? Your friend, the one you lost.
Did she trust you?
Yes, she did.
And she is not dead, she is so alive. Now jump!
(DOCTOR COUGHING) Funny thing is, for a spaceship, she doesn't do that much flying.
We'd better give her a couple of hours. You all right?
It doesn't matter.
Did we miss it?
Yeah.
Well, you can book another date.
Of course we can.
~Still got the honeymoon.
It's just a holiday now.
Yeah, yeah, sorry.
It's not your fault.
Oh, that's a change.
Wish you had a time machine then we could go back and get it right.
Yeah, yeah.
But even if I did, I couldn't go back on someone's personal timeline.
Apparently.
God, you're skinny. This wouldn't fit a rat.
Oh, and you'd better put this on.
Oh, do you have to rub it in?
Those creatures can trace you. This is a bio-damper, it should keep you hidden.
With this ring, I thee bio-damp.
For better or for worse.
Come on then, robot Santas, what are they for?
Oh, your basic robo-scavenger. The Father Christmas stuff is just a disguise.
They're trying to blend in. I met them last Christmas.
Why, what happened then?
Great big spaceship hovering over London, you didn’t notice?
Thad a bit of a hangover.
I spent Christmas day just over there, the Powell Estate, with this...
Family. My friend, she had this family, well...
Still.
Gone now.
Your friend, who was she?
Question is, what do camouflage robot mercenaries want with you?
And how did you get inside the Tardis? I don't know.
What's your job?
I'm a secretary.
Weird. I mean, you're not special, you're not powerful, you're not connected, you're not clever, you're not important.
This friend of yours, just before she left, did she punch you in the face?
Stop bleeping me!
What kind of secretary?
I'm at HC Clements. It's where I met Lance.
I was temping.
I mean, it was all a bit posh really.
I'd spent the last two years at a double glazing firm.
Well I thought I'm never going to fit in here and then he made me a cup of coffee.
I mean, that just doesn’t happen, nobody gets the secretaries a coffee.
And Lance, he's the head of HR. He don't need to bother with me.
But he was nice, he was funny.
She didn't know about that! “She didn't...
And it turns out he thought everyone else was really snotty, too.
That's how it started, me and him. One cup of coffee.
That was it.
When was this?
Six months ago.
Bit quick to get married.
Well, he insisted.
Will you marry me?
And he nagged and he nagged me.
Oh, just think about it. We'd make a great couple and I'll get rid of the dog.
And we could do up that back bedroom.
And he just wore me down and then finally I just gave in.
Please. Oh, please.
Please, please, please, please, please, please.
What does HC Clements do?
Oh, security systems, you know.
Entry codes, ID cards, that sort of thing.
If you ask me, it's a posh name for locksmiths.
Keys...
Anyway, enough of my CV. Come on, it's time to face the consequences.
Oh, this is going to be so shaming.
You can do the explaining, Martian boy.
Yeah, I'm not from Mars.
Oh, I had this great big reception all planned.
Everyone's gonna be heartbroken.
(MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY BY SLADE PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) You had the reception without me?
Donna, what happened to you?
You had the reception without me?
Hello, I'm the Doctor.
They had the reception without me.
Yes, I gathered.
Well, it was all paid for, why not?
Thank you, Nerys.
Well, what were we supposed to do?
I got your silly little message in the end. I'm on Earth? Very funny.
But what the hell happened? How did you do it?
(EVERYONE TALKING AT ONCE) (WHIMPERING) Oh.
Oh.
(LOVE DON'T ROAM PLAYING) Well, I taped the whole thing, they've all had a look.
They said sell it to You've Been Framed, I said, more like the news.
Here we are.
Can't be, play it again.
Clever, mind. Good trick, I'll give her that. I was clapping.
That looks like Huon particles.
What's that, then?
That's impossible, that's ancient.
Huon energy doesn't exist any more, not for billions of years.
It's so old that...
It can't be hidden by a bio-damper.
Donna! Donna, they've found you.
But you said I was safe.
The bio-damper doesn't work. We've got to get everyone out.
Oh, my God, it's all my family.
Out the back door, Maybe not.
We're trapped.
Christmas trees.
What about them?
They kill. Get away from the tree.
Get away from the Christmas trees, everyone get away...
Lance! Lance!
DOCTOR: Stay away from the tree!
Stay away from the tree.
Oh, for God's sake, the man's an idiot. What harm's the Christmas tree gonna...
Oh!
(SCREAMING) Oi, Santa, word of advice.
If you're attacking a man with a sonic screwdriver, don't let him near the sound system.
(PIERCING TONE) It's all right, Stan, you'll be all right.
Michael, Connie.
Sanita, do something useful.
What is it?
What were they?
Just stop wittering, just help him.
Look at that, remote control for the decorations, but there's a second remote control for the robots, They're not scavengers any more. I think someone's taken possession.
Never mind all that, you're a doctor, people have been hurt.
No, they wanted you alive. Look. They're not active now.
All the same, you could help.
Got to think of the bigger picture.
There's still a signal!
Donna, who is he? Who is that man?
(BUZZING) There's someone behind this, directing the roboforms.
But why is it me? What have I done?
If we find the controller, we'll find that out. Oh!
It's up there.
Something in the sky.
Clever, clever, clever boy.
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Little travelling man.
(CACKLING) You shall come to me and the beautiful bride.
Such secrets to unlock.
I shall descend this night.
I shall descend upon this Earth and shine!
I've lost the signal. Donna, we got to get to your office, HC Clements.
I think that's where it all started. Lance! Is he Lance? Lance, can you give me a lift?
To you lot this might just be a locksmith, but HC Clements was bought up 23 years ago by the Torchwood Institute.
Who are they?
They were behind The Battle of Canary Wharf.
Cyberman invasion.
Skies over London full of Daleks?
I was in Spain.
They had Cybermen in Spain.
Scuba diving.
That big picture, Donna, you keep on missing it.
Torchwood was destroyed, but HC Clements stayed in business.
I think someone else came in and took over the operation.
What do they want with me?
Somehow you've been dosed with Huon energy and that's a problem because Huon energy hasn't existed since the Dark Times.
The only place you find a Huon particle now is a remnant in the heart of the Tardis, See, that's what happened.
Say that's the Tardis and that's you.
The particles inside you activated, the two sets of particles magnetise and wap!
You were pulled inside the Tardis.
I'm a pencil inside a mug?
Yes, you are. 4H sums you up.
Lance, what was HC Clements working on?
Anything top secret, special operations, do not enter?
I don't know, I'm in charge of personnel. I wasn't project manager.
Why am I even explaining myself? What the hell are we talking about?
You make keys, that's the point.
And look at this, we're on the third floor. Underneath reception there's a basement, yes?
Then how come when you look in the lift, there's a button marked “lower basement”.
There's a whole floor which doesn't exist on the official plan.
So what's down there?
You telling me this building's got a secret floor?
No, I'm showing you this building's got a secret floor.
It needs a key.
I don't.
Right then, thanks, you two. I can handle this, see you later.
No chance, Martian, You're the man who keeps saving my life.
I ain't letting you out of my sight.
Going down.
Lance?
Maybe I should go to the police.
Inside!
To honour and obey.
Tell me about it, mate.
Oi!
The bride approaches! She is my key.
Where are we? What goes on down here?
Let's find out.
Do you think Mr Clements knows about this place?
The mysterious HC Clements? Oh, I think he’s part of it.
Oh, look, transport.
(DONNA AND THE DOCTOR LAUGHING) Wait here, just need to get my bearings. Don't do anything.
You better come back.
Couldn't get rid of you if I tried.
Donna, have you thought about this properly?
I mean, this is serious.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Oh, I thought July.
Thames flood barrier. Right on top of us.
Torchwood snuck in and built this place underneath.
What, there's like a secret base hidden underneath a major London landmark?
I know. I know, love.
Oh! Look at this, Stunning.
DONNA: What does it do?
Particle extrusion. Hold on.
Brilliant.
They've been manufacturing Huon particles.
Of course, my people got rid of Huons. They unravel the atomic structure.
Your people? Who are they? What company do you represent?
Oh, I'm a freelancer. But this lot are rebuilding them.
They've been using the river.
Extruding them through a flat hydrogen base so they've got the end result...
Huon particles in liquid form.
And that's what's inside me?
Oh, my God!
Genius.
Because the particles are inert, they need something living to catalyse inside and that's you.
Saturate the body and then...
Oh, the wedding! Yes, you're getting married. That's it!
Best day of your life, walking down the aisle. Your body is a battleground!
There's a chemical war inside.
Adrenaline, acetylcholine. Wham go the endorphins! Oh, you're cooking.
You're like a walking oven. A pressure cooker, a microwave, all churning away.
The particles reach boiling point... Shazam!
What did I do this time?
Are you enjoying this?
All right, just tell me, these particles, are they dangerous?
Am I safe?
Yes, Doctor...
if your lot got rid of Huon particles, why did they do that?
Because they were deadly.
Oh, my God. I'll sort it out, Donna.
Whatever's been done to you, I'll reverse it. I'm not about to lose someone else.
(DOOR OPENING) VOICE: Of, she's long since lost.
I have waited so long.
Hibernating at the edge of the universe.
Until the secret heart was uncovered and called out to waken me.
Someone's been digging.
Oh, very Torchwood. Drilled by laser.
How far down does it go?
Down and down. All the way to the centre of the Earth.
Really? Seriously, what for?
Dinosaurs.
What?
Dinosaurs?
What are you on about? Dinosaurs. That film under the Earth with dinosaurs.
Trying to help.
That's not helping.
Such a sweet couple.
Only a madman talks to thin air. And trust me, you don't want to make me mad.
Where are you?
High in the sky.
Floating so high on Christmas night.
DOCTOR: I didn't come all this way to talk on the intercom.
Come on, let's have a look at you.
Who are you with such command?
I'm the Doctor.
Prepare your best medicines, doctor man, for you will be sick at heart.
(HISSING) Racnoss.
That's impossible. You're one of the Racnoss.
Empress of the Racnoss.
If you're the Empress, where's the rest of the Racnoss?
Or are you the only one?
Such a sharp mind.
That's it. The last of your kind.
The Racnoss come from the Dark Times. Billions of years ago. Billions.
They were carnivores. Omnivores. They devoured whole planets.
Racnoss are born starving. Is that our fault?
(HISSING) They eat people?
HC Clements, did he wear those, uh, black and white shoes?
He did! We used to laugh. We used to call him the fat cat in spats.
Oh, my God!
Aye! Christmas dinner.
You shouldn't even exist.
DOCTOR: Way back in history, the Fledgling Empires went to war against the Racnoss.
They were wiped out.
Except for me.
That's what I've got inside me, that Huon energy thing.
Oi! Look at me, lady, I'm talking. Where do I fit in?
How come I get all stacked up with these Huon particles?
Look at me, you. Look me in the eye and tell me.
The bride is so feisty.
Yes, I am.
And I don't know what you are, you big thing.
But a spider's just a spider.
And an axe is an axe, Now, do it!
That was a good one. Your face.
Lance is funny.
What?
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
Lance, don't be so stupid. Get her!
God, she's thick.
Months I've had to put up with her. Months!
A woman who can't even point to Germany on a map.
I don't understand.
How did you meet him?
In the office.
He made you coffee.
What?
Every day I made you coffee.
You had to be dosed with liquid particles over six months, He was poisoning me.
It was all there in the job title. The head of human resources.
This time it's personnel.
But... We were getting married.
Well, I couldn't risk you running off. I had to say yes.
Then I was stuck with a woman who thinks the height of excitement is a new flavoured Pringle.
Oh, I had to sit there and listen to all that yap, yap, yap.
Ooh, Brad and Angelina!
Is Posh pregnant? X Factor. Atkin's diet. Feng shui. Split ends.
Text me, text me, text me.
Dear God, the never-ending fountain of fat, stupid trivia.
I deserve a medal.
Oh, is that what she's offered you?
The Empress of the Racnoss.
What are you? Her consort.
It's better than a night with her.
But I love you.
That's what made it easy.
LANCE: It's like you said, Doctor. The big picture.
What's the point of it all if the human race is nothing?
That's what the Empress can give me.
The chance to... go out there.
To see it. The size of it all.
I think you understand that, don't you, Doctor?
Who is this little physician?
She said Martian.
Oh, I'm sort of homeless.
But the point is, what's down here?
The Racnoss are extinct. What's going to help you 4,000 miles down?
That's just the molten core of the Earth, innit?
I think he wants us to talk.
I think so, too.
Well, tough. All we need is Donna.
Kill this chattering little doctor man.
Don't you hurt him.
No, it's all right.
No, I won't let them.
Ah! Now, except...
Take aim!
Well, I just want to point out the obvious.
They won't hit the bride. They're such very good shots.
(STUTTERING) Just hold on. Hold on just a tick. Just a tiny little, just a... tick.
If you think about it, the particles activated in Donna and drew her inside my spaceship.
So reverse it, the spaceship comes to her.
EMPRESS: Fire!
Off we go, then.
My key!
Oh, do you know what you said before about a time machine?
Well, I lied. And now we're gonna use it.
We need to find out what the Empress of the Racnoss is digging up.
If something's buried at the planet's core, then it must've been there since the beginning.
That's just brilliant. Molto bene! I've always wanted to see this.
Donna, I'm going further back than I've ever been before.
If a key is lost, then another must be cut.
(YELLING) We've arrived. You want to see?
I suppose.
The scanner's a bit small. Maybe your way's best.
Come on.
No human's ever seen this, You'll be the first.
All I wanna see is my bed.
Donna Noble, welcome to the creation of the Earth.
We've gone back 4.6 billion years.
There's no solar system. Not yet.
Only dust and rocks and gas.
That's the sun. Over there. Brand-new.
Just beginning to burn.
Where's the Earth?
All around us.
In the dust.
Puts the wedding in perspective.
Lance was right. We're just tiny.
No, but that's what you do. The human race.
Make sense out of chaos.
Marking it out with weddings and Christmas and calendars.
This whole process is beautiful. But only if it is being observed.
So I came out of all this.
Isn't that brilliant?
I think that's the Isle of Wight.
Eventually, gravity takes hold.
Say, one big rock, heavier than the others, starts to pull other rocks towards it.
All the dust and gas and elements get pulled in, everything piling in until you get...
The Earth.
Now, the question is, what was that first rock?
DONNA: Look.
The Racnoss, Now I have measured the bride's catalysis, I can force feed it.
Drink the particles, become the key!
Hold on, the Racnoss are hiding from the war.
What's it doing?
Exactly what you said.
Oh, they didn't just bury something in the centre of the Earth.
They became the centre of the Earth.
The first rock.
(RUMBLING) What was that? “Trouble.
My wonderful key.
Now, my servants, find him.
What the hell is it doing?
A little trick of mine. Particles pulling particles.
Well, it works in reverse, and they're pulling us back.
Well, can't you stop it? Hasn't it got a handbrake?
Can't you reverse or warp or fade or something?
Back-seat driver. Oh! Wait a minute, The extrapolator.
It can't stop us, but it should give us a good bump!
EMPRESS: The bride shall join her groom.
What a wedding there shall be.
Now!
We're about 200 yards to the right. Come on.
She is close. The holy bride in white.
Find her. Find her!
What do we do?
I don't know. I'm making it up as I go along.
But trust me, I've got history.
I still don't understand.
I'm full of particles, but what for?
There's a Racnoss web at the centre of the Earth, but my people unravelled their power source.
If Huon particles cease to exist, the Racnoss will stop.
They just stayed in hibernation for billions of years, frozen, dead, kaput.
So you're the new key. Brand-new particles, living particles.
They need you to open it and you have never been so quiet.
Oh!
I hate you.
Yeah, I think we've gone bit beyond that now, sweetheart, My golden couple, together at last!
Your awful wedded life!
Tell me, do you want to be released?
BOTH: Yes.
You're supposed to say, “I do.” No chance. “Say it.
I do.
I do!
I don't.
(LAUGHING) Activate the particles.
Purge every last one!
And release!
The secret heart unlocks and they will waken from their sleep of ages.
Who will? What's down there?
How thick are you?
My children, the long lost Racnoss, now reborn to feast on flesh.
The web star shall come to me.
My babies will be hungry. They need sustenance.
Perish the web.
Use her, not me. Use her!
Oh, my funny little lad, but you were quite impolite to your lady friend.
The Empress does not approve.
Lance!
It's Christmas.
Harvest the humans. Reduce them to meat.
EMPRESS: My children are climbing towards me and none shall stop them.
So you might as well unmask, my clever little doctor man.
Oh, well, nice try.
I've got you, Donna.
I'm gonna fall!
You're gonna swing.
(SCREAMING) I've got you.
(CRASHING) (CLATTERING) Oh, sorry.
Thanks for nothing.
The doctor man amuses me.
Empress of the Racnoss, I give you one last chance.
I can find you a planet.
I can find you and your children a place in the universe to coexist.
Take that offer and end this now.
These men are so funny.
What's your answer?
Oh! I'm afraid I have to decline.
Then what happens next is your own doing.
I'll show you what happens next.
At arms!
Take aim!
And...
Relax.
What did you do?
Guess what I've got, Donna.
Pockets, How did that fit in there?
They're bigger on the inside.
Roboforms are not necessary.
My children may feast on Martian flesh.
Oh, but I'm not from Mars.
Then where?
My home planet is far away and long since gone.
But its name lives on.
Gallifrey.
They murdered the Racnoss.
I warned you.
You did this.
No, no. Don't!
No!
No! No! No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
My children!
(EMPRESS SHRIEKING) My children!
My children!
Doctor!
You can stop now.
My children!
Come on, time to find a way out.
Transport me!
Oh, they will suffer. So suffer!
This planet shall be scorched.
What about the Empress?
She's used up all her Huon energy. She's defenceless.
MAN: Orders of Mr Saxon, fire at will.
Fire!
(SCREAMING) There's just one problem.
What is it?
We've drained the Thames.
(FOG HORNS BLOWING) (THE DOCTOR AND DONNA LAUGHING) DOCTOR: There we go. I told you she'd be all right.
Survive anything.
More than I've done.
Well, all the Huon particles are gone.
No damage. You're fine.
Yeah, apart from that.
I missed my wedding, I lost my job and became a widow on the same day.
Sort of.
I couldn't save him.
He deserved it.
No, he didn't.
I better get inside, they'll be worried.
Best Christmas present they could have.
Oh, no, I forgot, you hate Christmas.
Yes, I do.
Even if it's snowing?
I can't believe you did that.
Oh, basic atmospheric excitation.
Merry Christmas.
And you.
So, what will you do with yourself now?
Not getting married, for starters.
And I'm not gonna temp any more. I don't know, travel.
See a bit more of planet Earth, walk in the dust.
Just go out there and do something.
Well, you could always...
What?
.. come with me.
“No.
Okay.
I can't.
No, that's fine.
No, but really, I mean, everything we did today, do you live your life like that?
Not all the time.
I think you do.
And I couldn't.
But you've seen it out there.
It's beautiful.
And it's terrible, That place was flooded and burning and they were dying, and you stood there like, I don't know, a stranger.
And then you made it snow! I mean, you scare me to death.
Well, then.
I'll tell you what I will do, though. Christmas dinner, Oh, come on.
I don't do that sort of thing.
You did it last year, you said so.
And you might as well because Mum always cooks enough for 20.
Alright then. But you go first, better warn them, and don't say I'm a Martian.
I just have to park her properly. She might drift off to the Middle Ages.
I'll see you in a minute.
(WHOOSHING) Doctor!
Doctor!
Blimey, you can shout.
Am | ever gonna see you again?
If I'm lucky.
Just promise me one thing.
Find someone, I don't need anyone.
Yes, you do.
‘Cause sometimes I think you need someone to stop you.
Yeah.
Thanks then, Donna. Good luck.
And just...
be magnificent.
I think I will yeah.
Doctor?
Oh, what is it now?
That friend of yours, what was her name?
Her name was Rose.
(WHOOSHING) I'm the Doctor.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) (MOBILE RINGING) You're up early! What's happening?
It's a nightmare ‘cause Dad won't listen and I'm telling you, Mum's going mental.
Swear to God, Martha, this is epic. You got to get in there and stop him.
How do I do that?
Tell Dad he can't bring her.
(BEEPING) Hold on, that's Leo. I'll call you back.
Martha, if Mum and Dad start to kick off, tell them I don't even want a party. I didn't even ask for one, They can always give me the money instead.
Why do I have to tell them? Why can't you?
Hold on, that's Mum. I'll call you back.
I don't mind your father making a fool of himself in private, but this is Leo's 21st. Everyone is going to be there, and the entire family is going to look ridiculous.
Mum, it's a party. I can't stop Dad from bringing his girlfriend.
(BEEPING) Hold on, that's Dad. I'll call you back.
Martha, now tell your mother.
Leo is my son, and I'm paying for half that party.
I'm entitled to bring who I like.
I know, but think what it's going to look like for Mum if you're standing there with Annalise.
What's wrong with Annalise?
Is that Martha? Say hi!
Hi, Martha! Hi!
Hi, Annalise.
Big kiss! Lots of love! See you at the party, babes!
Now take me shopping, big boy.
Like so!
See?
Oi! Watch it, mate!
I was all right till this morning, and then...
I don't know, I woke up and I felt all dizzy again.
It was worse than when I came in.
Pulse is slightly thready.
Well, let's see what Britain's finest might suggest. Any ideas, Morgenstern?
Er, dizziness could be a sign of early onset diabetes.
Hardly early onset, if you'll forgive me, Miss Finnegan.
Any more ideas? Swales?
Um...
Could recommend a CT scan.
And spend all our money?
Jones?
We could take bloods and check for Méniere's disease, Or we could simply ask the patient.
What did you have for dinner last night?
I had salad.
And the night before? Salad, again.
And salad every night for the past week, contrary to my instructions.
A salt deficiency, that's all.
Simple, honest salt.
Hippocrates himself expounded on the virtues of salt.
Recommended the inhalation of steam from sea water.
Though no doubt if he'd been afflicted with my students, his oaths might have been rather more colourful.
Now then, Mr Smith, a very good morning to you. How are you today?
Oh, not so bad. Still a bit, you know... Blah.
John Smith, admitted yesterday with severe abdominal pains.
Jones, why don't you see what you can find? Amaze me.
It wasn't very clever running around outside, was it?
Sorry?
On Chancellor Street, this morning.
Came up to me and took your tie off.
Really? What did I do that for?
I don't know, you just did.
Not me. I was here in bed. Ask the nurses.
Well, that’s weird ‘cause it looked like you.
Have you got a brother?
No, not any more. Just me.
As time passes and I grow ever more infirm and weary, Miss Jones...
Sorry.
Right.
(HEARTS BEATING) I weep for future generations.
Are you having trouble locating the heart, Miss Jones?
Um, I don't know. Stomach cramps?
That is a symptom, not a diagnosis.
And you rather failed basic techniques by not consulting first with the patient's chart.
That happened to me this morning.
Thad the same thing on the door handle.
And me, in the lift.
Well, it's only to be expected.
There's a thunderstorm moving in and lightning is a form of static electricity, as was first proven by... Anyone?
Benjamin Franklin.
Correct.
My mate, Ben. That was a day and a half. I got rope burns off that kite.
And then I got soaked.
Quite.
And then I got electrocuted!
Moving on.
I think perhaps a visit from psychiatric.
And next, we have Mr...
No, listen, I've worked out a plan.
We tell Annalise that the buffet tonight is 100% carbohydrate, and she won't turn up.
I wish you'd take this seriously.
That's our inheritance she's spending on fake tan.
Tell you what, I'm not that far away.
I'll meet you for a sandwich, we can draw up a battle plan.
What, in this weather? I'm not going out, it's pouring down.
It's not raining here.
(THUNDER RUMBLING) God, that's weird. It's raining right on top of you.
I can see it, but it's dry where I am.
Well, you just got lucky.
No, but it's like in cartoons, when a man's got a cloud over his head.
Yeah, but listen, I'll tell you what we do...
We tell Dad and Annalise to get there early, about 7:30, and we tell Leo to get there at the same time so we can do all that birthday stuff.
We tell Mum to get there for about 8:30-9:00, then that gives me time to have a word with Annalise and...
What?
The rain.
It's only rain.
Martha, have you seen the rain?
Why is everyone fussing about rain?
It's going up.
The rain is going up.
What the hell was that?
Are you all right?
I think so, yeah.
It felt like an earthquake or...
Martha, it's night.
~But it was lunch time...
It's not night.
But it's got to be. It's dark.
We're on the moon!
Can't be, We're on the moon.
We're on the bloody moon.
I'm sorry, miss, no.
Oh, my God.
(SIREN WAILING) Martha? Martha, can you hear me?
Martha?
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) Somebody help! Somebody help me!
Have you seen... I'm sorry, I can't.
All right now, everyone, back to bed.
We've got an emergency, but we'll sort it out. Don't worry.
It's real. It’s really real.
Hold on.
Don't! We'll lose all the air!
But they're not exactly airtight. If the air was gonna get sucked out, it would've happened straightaway, but it didn't.
So, how come?
Very good point!
Brilliant, in fact. What was your name?
Martha.
And it was Jones, wasn't it?
Well, Martha Jones, question is, how are we still breathing?
We can't be!
Obviously we are so don't waste my time.
Martha, what have we got? Is there a balcony on this floor, or a veranda?
By the patients’ lounge, yeah.
You fancy going out?
Okay.
We might die.
We might not.
Good. Come on.
Not her, she'd hold us up.
(DOCTOR INHALING) We've got air.
How does that work?
Just be glad it does.
I've got a party tonight.
It's my brother's 21st.
My mother’s gonna be really... Really...
You okay?
Yeah.
Sure?
Yeah.
Do you want to go back in?
No way.
I mean, we could die any minute, but all the same, it's beautiful.
Do you think?
How many people want to go to the moon? And here we are.
Standing in the Earth light.
What do you think happened?
What do you think?
Extraterrestrial. It's got to be.
I don't know, a few years ago that would've sounded mad, but these days...
That spaceship flying into Big Ben. Christmas. Those Cybermen things.
Thad a cousin, Adeola.
She worked at Canary Wharf.
She never came home.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I was there, in the battle. It was...
I promise you, Mr Smith, we will find a way out.
If we can travel to the moon, then we can travel back.
There's got to be a way.
It's not Smith. That's not my real name.
Who are you, then?
I'm the Doctor.
Me, too, if I ever pass my exams.
What is it then, Dr Smith?
Just the Doctor.
How do you mean, just the Doctor?
Just the Doctor.
What, people call you "the Doctor"?
Yeah.
Well, I'm not. Far as I'm concerned, you've got to earn that title.
Well, I'd better make a start, then. Let's have a look.
There must be some sort of...
Force-field.
Keeping the air in.
But if that's like a bubble sealing us in, that means this is the only air we've got.
What happens when it runs out?
How many people in this hospital?
Don't know, a thousand?
One thousand people, suffocating.
Why would anyone do that?
(RUMBLING) Heads up! Ask him yourself.
MARTHA: Aliens, That's aliens!
Real, proper aliens.
Judoon.
Mr Stoker?
I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to ask, but can you help me?
I think we've gone beyond aspirin, Miss...
Finnegan.
Names! What are names now when something unnameable is marching towards us across the moon?
Two more years, I thought. Two more years and then retire to Florida.
But there is Florida, in the sky. I can see it.
My daughter. She's still in university. I am never going to see her again.
But I need help, Mr Stoker.
I can't do anything!
Oh, I think you can.
What do you two want? It's a bit late to sign for anything.
These are my lovely boys. I prefer not to get my hands dirty.
I'm sorry?
You see, there are great tests to come, and terrible deeds.
Some of them my own.
But if I'm to survive this, I need you.
What are you talking about?
Blood. Specifically, yours.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Will you let go of me! What the hell? Let go!
You see, I was only salt deficient because I'm so very good at absorbing it.
But now I need fire in my veins.
And who better than a consultant, with blood full of salty fats and vintage wines and all those Michelin star sauces?
Who are you?
Oh, I'm a survivor, Mr Stoker.
At any cost.
Look!
I've even brought a straw.
(SCREAMING) Bo! Sco! Fo! Do! No! Kro! Blo! Co! Sho! Ro!
We are citizens of planet Earth. We welcome you in peace.
(GROWLING) Please don’t hurt me. I was just trying to help, I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I was just trying to help, I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.
Language assimilated. Designation, Earth English.
You will be catalogued.
Category, human.
Catalogue all suspects.
Aw, look down there, you've got a little shop.
I like a little shop.
Never mind that. What are Judoon?
They're like police. Well, police-for-hire.
They're more like interplanetary thugs.
And they brought us to the moon?
Neutral territory. According to Galactic Law, they've got no jurisdiction over the Earth so they isolated it.
That rain and lightning, that was them using an H20 Scoop.
Why are you on about, Galactic Law? I mean, where did you get that from?
JUDOON: Human.
If they're police, are we under arrest?
Are we trespassing on the moon or something?
No, but I like that! Good thinking. No, wish it were that simple.
They're making a catalogue, that means they're after something non-human, which is very bad news for me.
Why?
Oh, you're kidding me?
Don't be ridiculous, Stop looking at me like that.
Come on, then.
Troop 5, floor one.
Troop 6, floor two.
Identify humans and find the transgressor.
Find it!
Prepare to be catalogued!
Do what they say. All they want to do is shine this light thing.
It's all right, they're not going to hurt us. Just listen to them.
Witness the crime.
Charge, physical assault. Plea, guilty.
Sentence, execution.
You didn't have to do that.
Justice is swift.
(BUZZING) They've reached the third floor.
What's that thing? ~Sonic screwdriver.
Well, if you're not going to answer me properly.
No, really, it is! It's a screwdriver and it's... sonic.
Look.
What else have you got? A laser spanner?
I did, but it was stolen by Emily Pankhurst. Cheeky woman.
What's wrong with this computer?
Judoon must have locked it down.
Judoon platoon upon the moon.
I was just travelling past, I swear, I was just wandering.
I wasn't looking for trouble. Honestly, I wasn't.
But I noticed these plasma coils around the hospital.
That lightning, that's a plasma coil, it's been building up for two days now.
So I checked in, I thought something was going on inside.
Turns out the plasma coils were the Judoon up above.
What are they looking for?
Something that looks human, but isn't.
Like you, apparently.
Like me, but not me.
Haven't they got a photo?
Might be a shape-changer.
Whatever it is, can't you just leave the Judoon to find it?
If they declare the hospital guilty of harbouring a fugitive, they'll sentence it to execution.
All of us?
Oh, yes.
But if I can find this thing first... Oh!
Do you see? They're thick. Judoon are thick.
They are so completely thick, they've wiped the records!
Oh, that's clever.
What are we looking for?
I don't know.
Say, any patient admitted in the past week with unusual symptoms.
Maybe there's a backup.
Just keep working, I'll go and ask Mr Stoker. He might know.
Mr Stoker...
(SLURPING) Kill her!
I've restored the backup.
I found her!
You did what?
Run!
Quick!
When I say “now”, press the button.
But I don't know which one.
Then find out!
Now!
What did you do?
Increased the radiation by 5,000%. Killed him dead.
But isn't that gonna kill you?
Nah, it's only roentgen radiation.
We used to play with roentgen bricks in the nursery.
It's safe for you to come out. I've absorbed it all.
All I need to do is expel it.
See, if I concentrate, shift the radiation out of my body and into one spot.
(GRUNTS) Say, my left shoe.
Here we go. Here we go. Easy does it.
Out, out, out, out, out, out, out...
Ow, ow, ow!
(EXCLAIMS) Itches, itches, itches, itches!
Hold on.
Done!
You're completely mad.
You're right, I look daft with one shoe.
Barefoot on the moon!
So what is that thing? And where's it from, Planet Zovirax?
It's just a Slab. They're called Slabs.
Basic slave drones, you see.
Solid leather all the way through. Someone has got one hell of a fetish.
But it was that woman, Miss Finnegan.
It was working for her, just like a servant.
My sonic screwdriver!
She was one of the patients, but...
Burnt out my sonic screwdriver!
She had this straw, like some sort of vampire.
I love my sonic screwdriver!
Doctor!
Sorry.
You called me Doctor.
Anyway...
Miss Finnegan is the alien. She was drinking Mr Stoker's blood.
Funny time to take a snack. You'd think she'd be hiding.
Unless... No!
Yes! That's it! Wait a minute.
Yes! Shape-changer, internal shape-changer!
She wasn't drinking blood, she was assimilating it.
JUDOON: Prepare to be catalogued!
(ALL SCREAMING) Human.
If she can assimilate Mr Stoker's blood, mimic the biology, she'll register as human.
We've got to find her and show the Judoon. Come on!
Human.
That's the thing about Slabs. They always travel in pairs.
What about you?
What about me what?
Haven't you got backup? You must have a partner or something.
Humans! We're stuck on the moon, running out of air, with Judoon and a bloodsucking criminal, and you're asking personal questions. Come on.
I like that. "Humans!" I'm still not convinced you're an alien.
Non-human!
Oh, my God, you really are!
And again.
They've done this floor. Come on.
The Judoon are logical and just a little bit thick.
They won't go back to check a floor they've checked already. If we're lucky.
How much oxygen is there?
Not enough for all these people. We're gonna run out.
How you feeling? You all right?
Running on adrenalin.
Welcome to my world.
What about the Judoon?
Great big Lung reserves. It won't slow them down.
Where's Mr Stoker's office?
It's this way.
She's gone. She was here.
Drained him dry. Every last drop.
I was right, she's a Plasmavore.
What's she doing on Earth?
Hiding, on the run. Like Ronald Biggs in Rio de Janeiro.
What's she doing now? She's still not safe.
The Judoon could execute us all. Come on.
Wait a minute, Think, think, think.
If I was a wanted Plasmavore surrounded by police, what would I do?
Oh! She's as clever as me.
Almost.
(CRASHING) Find the non-human! Execute!
Martha, stay here. I need time, you've got to hold them up.
How do I do that?
Just forgive me for this.
It could save a thousand lives and it means nothing. Honestly, nothing.
That was nothing?
Have you seen? There are these things!
These great, big space rhino things.
I mean, rhinos from space, and we're on the moon!
Great, big space rhinos with guns! On the moon!
I only came in for my bunions! Look!
All fixed now, perfectly good treatment, the nurses were lovely.
I said to my wife, "I'd recommend this place to anyone.” But then we end up on the moon! And did I mention the rhinos?
Hold him.
Find the non-human! Execute!
Now, listen, I know who you're looking for.
She's this woman. She calls herself Florence.
Human.
Wait. Non-human trace suspected.
Non-human element confirmed.
Authorise full scan.
(MUMBLES) What are you?
What are you?
That big machine thing, is it supposed to be making that noise?
You wouldn't understand.
But isn't that a magnetic resonance imaging thing?
Like a ginormous sort of a magnet? I did Magnetics GCSE.
Well, I failed, but all the same.
A magnet with its setting now increased to 50,000 tesla.
Ooh, that's a bit strong, isn’t it?
It'll send out a magnetic pulse that'll fry the brainstems of every living thing within 250,000 miles.
Except for me. Safe in this room.
But hold on, hold on. I did Geography GCSE, I passed that one.
Doesn't that distance include the Earth?
Only the side facing the moon. The other half will survive.
Call it my little gift.
Sorry, you'll have to excuse me, I'm a little bit out of my depth.
I've spent the past 15 years working as a postman. Hence the bunion.
Why would you do that?
With everyone dead, the Judoon ships will be mine to make my escape.
No, that's weird. You're talking like you're some sort of an alien.
Quite so.
No! ~Oh, yes.
You're joshing me!
Tam not.
I'm talking to an alien, in a hospital?
What, has this place got an ET department?
It's the perfect hiding place. Blood banks downstairs for a midnight feast.
And all this equipment ready to arm myself with should the police come looking.
So, those rhinos, they're looking for you!
Yes. But I'm hidden.
Oh, right. Maybe that's why they're increasing their scans.
They're doing what?
Big Chief Rhino boy, he said, “No sign of a non-human.
“We must increase our scans up to setting two." Then I must assimilate again.
What does that mean?
I must appear to be human.
Well, you're welcome to come home and meet the wife. She'd be honoured.
We can have cake, Why should I have cake? I've got my little straw.
That's nice. Milkshake? I like banana.
You're quite the funny man.
And yet, I think, laughing on purpose at the darkness, I think it's time you found some peace. Steady him.
What are you doing?
I'm afraid this is going to hurt.
But if it's any consolation, the dead don't tend to remember.
Confirm. Human.
Traces of facial contact with non-human.
Continue the search!
You will need this.
What's that for?
Compensation.
Now, see what you've done? This poor man just died of fright.
Scan him!
Confirmation, deceased.
No, he can't be! Let me through. Let me see him.
Stop. Case closed.
But it was her!
She killed him. She did it. She murdered him!
Judoon have no authority over human crime.
But she's not human!
Oh, but I am. I've been catalogued.
But she's not. She assim...
Wait a minute, You drank his blood? The Doctor's blood!
Oh, I don’t mind. Scan all you like.
Non-human!
But... What?
Confirm analysis.
Oh, but there's a mistake, surely. I'm human.
I'm as human as they come.
He gave his life so they'd find you.
Confirm, Plasmavore. Charged with the crime of murdering the Child Princess of Padrivole Regency Nine.
Well, she deserved it!
Those pink cheeks and those blonde curls and that simpering voice.
She was begging for the bite of a Plasmavore!
Then you confess?
Confess? I'm proud of it!
Slab, stop them!
Verdict, guilty. Sentence, execution.
Enjoy your victory, Judoon.
Because you're going to burn with me! Burn in hell!
Case closed.
But what did she mean, burn with me?
The scanner shouldn't be doing that. She's done something.
(BEEPING RAPIDLY) Scans detect lethal acceleration of mono-magnetic pulse.
Well, do something! Stop it!
Our jurisdiction has ended. Judoon will evacuate.
What? You can't just leave it! What's it gonna do?
All units withdraw!
What about the air? We're running out of air.
You can't go!
That thing's gonna explode, and it's your fault!
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Two hearts!
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
The scanner...
She did something.
Oh! The sonic!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, please.
Come on, Judoon, reverse it.
It's raining, Martha!
It's raining on the moon.
MAN: Pass me the first aid kit.
I said I represent the human race.
I told them, you can't do that. I said...
Martha! Oh, my God, I thought you were dead.
What happened? It was so weird!
The police wouldn't say, they didn't have a clue. I tried phoning.
Mum's on her way, but she can't get through. They've closed off the roads.
There's thousands of people trying to get in.
The whole city's come to a halt.
And Dad phoned, it's on the news and everything. He was crying.
Oh, my God, I've been a mess.
But what happened? I mean, what really happened? Where were you?
MAN ON RADIO: Eyewitness reports from the Royal Hope Hospital continue to pour in, and all seem to be remarkably consistent.
This from medical student Oliver Morgenstern.
I was there, I saw it happen and I feel uniquely privileged.
I looked out at the surface of the moon.
I saw the Earth suspended in space, and it all just proves Mr Saxon right.
We're not alone in the universe.
There's life out there. Wild and extraordinary life.
I am not staying in there to be insulted!
She didn't mean it, sweetheart. She was just saying you look healthy.
No, I did not. I said orange.
Clive, that woman is disrespecting me. She's never liked me.
Oh, I can't think why, after you stole my husband!
I was seduced! I'm entirely innocent. Tell her, babes!
And then she has a go at Martha, practically accused her of making the whole thing up.
Mum, I don't mind. Just leave it.
Oh, "I've been to the moon." As if!
They were drugged. It said so on the news.
Since when did you watch the news? You can't handle Quizmania.
Annalise started it. She did, I heard her.
Tish, don't make it worse.
Come off it, Leo.
What did she buy you? Soap! A75 pence soap!
I'm never talking to your family again!
~Stay! Have a nice party!
Don't you dare!
I'm putting my foot down!
Make a fool of yourself!
This is me, putting my foot down!
God knows you've been doing it for the last 25 years. Why stop now?
Mum, don't. I asked the DJ and he's playing that song later...
I went to the moon today.
Bit more peaceful than down here.
You never even told me who you are.
The Doctor.
But what sort of species? It's not every day I get to ask that.
I'm a Time Lord.
Right. Not pompous at all, then.
I just thought, since you saved my life and I've got a brand-new sonic screwdriver which needs road-testing, you might fancy a trip.
What, into space?
I can't, I've got exams. I've got things to do.
I have to go into town first thing and pay the rent. I got my family going mad.
If it helps, I can travel in time as well.
Get out of here.
I can!
Come on now, that is going too far. I'll prove it.
(WHOOSHING) Told you!
No, but... That was this morning.
But... Did you...
Oh, my God, you can travel in time!
But hold on, if you could see me this morning, why didn't you tell me not to go into work?
Crossing into established events is strictly forbidden.
Except for cheap tricks.
And that's your spaceship?
It's called the Tardis.
Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
Your spaceship’s made of wood.
There's not much room, we'd be a bit intimate.
Take a look.
No, no, no...
But it's just a box.
But it's huge!
How does it do that?
It's wood!
It's like a box with that room just crammed in.
It's bigger on the inside!
Is it? I hadn't noticed.
Alright then, let's get going.
But is there a crew?
Like a navigator and stuff? Where is everyone?
Just me.
All on your own?
Well, sometimes I have guests.
I mean, some friends travelling alongside me.
Thad... It was recently...
Friend of mine.
Rose, her name was. Rose and...
We were together. Anyway...
Where is she now?
With her family. Happy. She's fine, she's...
Not that you're replacing her!
Never said I was, Just one trip. To say thanks. You get one trip then back home.
I'd rather be on my own.
Well, you're the one that kissed me.
That was a genetic transfer.
And if you will wear a tight suit...
Now, don't.
And then travel all the way across the universe just to ask me on a date.
Stop it!
For the record, I'm not remotely interested.
I only go for humans.
Good!
Now then, close down the Gravitic Anomalyser.
Fire up the Helmic Regulator.
And finally, the handbrake.
Ready?
No.
Off we go!
Blimey! It's a bit bumpy!
Welcome aboard, Miss Jones.
It's my pleasure, Mr Smith.
The Globe Theatre, containing the man himself.

@@@@@@
# Her face was like a winter moon # That lights the traveller's way # Her smile was like a summer bloom # That bursts then fades away # My love is night, my love is day # My love, she is my world # Such sweet music shows your blood to be afire.
Why wait we on stale custom for consummation?
Oh, yes! Tonight's the night.
Would you enter, bold sir?
Oh, I would.
Lilith, this cannot be the home of one so beautiful.
Forgive me, this is foul.
Shh.
Sad words suit not upon a lover's tongue.
Your kiss transformed me.
A suitor should meet his beloved's parents.
Mother Doomfinger.
And Mother Bloodtide.
(CACKLING) (SCREAMING) Soon, at the hour of woven words, we shall rise again and this fleeting Earth will perish!
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) (RUMBLING) But how do you travel in time? What makes it go?
Oh, let's take the fun and the mystery out of everything.
Martha, you don't want to know. It just does. Hold on tight!
Blimey! Do you have to pass a test to fly this thing?
Yes, and I failed. Now, make the most of it.
I promised you one trip and one trip only.
Outside this door, brave new world.
Where are we?
Take a look.
After you.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're so kidding me!
Oh, my God, we did it! We travelled in time!
Where are we? No, sorry.
Got to get used to this whole new language. When are we?
Mind out.
Garde 4 ‘eau!
Somewhere before the invention of the toilet. Sorry about that.
I've seen worse. I worked the late-night shift, A&E.
But are we safe? I mean, can we move around and stuff?
Of course we can. Why do you ask?
It's like in the films.
You step on a butterfly, you change the future of the human race.
Tell you what, then. Don't step on any butterflies.
What have butterflies ever done to you?
What if... I don't know.
What if I kill my grandfather?
Are you planning to?
No.
Well, then.
And this is London?
Think so.
Round about, um, ooh, 1599.
Oh, but hold on. Am I all right?
I'm not going to get carted off as a slave, am I?
Why would they do that?
Not exactly white, in case you haven't noticed.
I'm not even human. Just walk about like you own the place. Works for me.
Besides, you'd be surprised.
Elizabethan England, not so different from your time.
Look over there. They've got recycling.
A water cooler moment.
. and the Earth will be consumed by flame!
Global warming. Oh, yes, and entertainment.
Popular entertainment for the masses.
If I'm right, we're just down the river by Southwark.
Right next to...
Oh, yes!
The Globe Theatre!
Brand-new, just opened.
Though, strictly speaking, it's not a globe.
It's a tetradecagon, 14 sides, containing the man himself.
Whoa, you don't mean...
Is Shakespeare in there?
Oh, yes.
Miss Jones, will you accompany me to the theatre?
Mr Smith, I will!
When you get home, you can tell everyone you've seen Shakespeare.
Then I could get sectioned.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING) That's amazing, just amazing. It's worth putting up with the smell.
And those are men dressed as women, yeah?
London never changes.
Where's Shakespeare? I want to see Shakespeare!

The most human human there's ever been.
Now, we're gonna hear him speak.
Always, he chooses the best words. New, beautiful, brilliant words.
Oh, shut your big, fat mouths!
Oh, well.
You should never meet your heroes.
You've got excellent taste, I'll give you that.
Oh, that's a wig.
(ALL LAUGHING) Wind the craft of ancient harm.
The time approaches for our charm.
I know what you're all saying, "Love's Labour's Lost, that's a funny ending, isn’t it?” It just stops. Will the boys get the girls?
Well, don't get your hose in a tangle. You'll find out soon, ALL: When?
Yeah, yeah. All in good time.
You don’t rush a genius.
(ALL LAUGHING) When?
Tomorrow night.
(ALL CHEERING) The premier of my brand-new play, a sequel, no less.
And I call it Love's Labour's Won, (ALL CHEERING) I'm not an expert, but I've never heard of Love's Labour's Won.
Exactly. The lost play. Doesn't exist. I mean, rumours.
It's mentioned in lists of his plays, but never ever turns up, and no one knows why.
Have you got a mini-disc or something?
We can tape it, we can flog it. Sell it when we get home, make a mint.
No.
That would be bad.
Yeah, yeah.
How come it disappeared in the first place?
Well...
Oh, I was just going to give you a quick little trip in the Tardis, but I suppose we could stay a bit longer.
Here you go, Will, drink up.
There's enough beer in this lodgings house to sink the Spanish.
Dolly Bailey, you've saved my life.
I'll do more than that later tonight.
And you, girl, hurry up with the tasks.
The talk of gentlemen's best not overheard.
Yeah, ma'am. Sorry, ma’am.
You must be mad, Will. Love's Labour's Won? We're not ready.
It's supposed to be next week. What made you say that?
You haven't even finished it yet.
I’ve just got the final scene to go. You'll get it by morning.
Hello! Excuse me. Not interrupting, am I? Mr Shakespeare, isn't it?
Oh, no, no, no. Who let you in?
No autographs. No, you can't have yourself sketched with me, and please don't ask where I get my ideas from.
Thanks for the interest. Now be a good boy and shove...
Hey, nonny, nonny!
Sit right down here, next to me.
You two get sewing on them costumes. Off you go.
Come on, lads, I think our William's found his new muse.
Sweet lady.
Such unusual clothes.
So fitted, Erm, verily, forsooth, egads!
No, no, don't do that.
I'm Sir Doctor of Tardis, and this is my companion, Miss Martha Jones.
Interesting. That bit of paper, it's blank.
Oh, that's...
Very clever, that proves it.
Absolute genius.
Hmm.
No, it says right there, "Sir Doctor and Martha Jones." It says so.
I say it’s blank.
Psychic paper. Um... Long story. Oh, I hate starting from scratch.
Psychic? I've never heard that before, and words are my trade.
Who are you exactly? More to the point, who is your delicious blackamoor lady?
What did you say?
Whoops.
Isn't that a word we use nowadays?
An Ethiop girl, a swarth, a Queen of Afric?
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
It's political correctness gone mad.
Martha's from a far off land, Freedonia.
Excuse me. Hold hard a moment.
This is abominable behaviour.
A new play with no warning.
I demand to see a script, Mr Shakespeare.
As Master of the Revels, every new script must be registered at my office and examined by me before it can be performed.
Tomorrow morning, first thing, I'll send it round.
I don't work to your schedule, you work to mine.
The script, now! I can't.
Then tomorrow's performance is cancelled.
It's all go around here, isn't it?
I'm returning to my office for a banning order.
If it's the last thing I do, Love's Labour's Won will never be played.
Ooh! Sorry, sir. Begging your pardon, sir.
Mind you don't hurt that handsome head of yours.
Hold hard, wanton woman!
I shall return later.
Oh, my mothers.
There's one seeks to stop the performance tomorrow.
But it must be tomorrow!
Love's Labour's Won must be performed.
Fear not.
Chant with me.
Water damps the fiercest flame.
Drowns down girls and boys the same.
Well then, mystery solved.
That's Love's Labour's Won over and done with.
I thought it might be something, you know, more mysterious.
(WOMAN SCREAMING) WOMAN: Help me!
It's that Lynley bloke.
What's wrong with him?
Leave it to me, I'm a doctor.
So am I. Near enough.
Now to halt the vital part.
Stab the flesh!
Stop the heart.
Eternal sleep is thine.
Can't get the heart going. Mr Lynley! Come on. Can you hear me?
You're gonna be all right.
(GURGLING) What the hell is that?
I've never seen a death like it. His lungs are full of water. He drowned.
I don't know, like a blow to the heart. A visible blow.
Good mistress, this poor fellow has died from a sudden imbalance of the humours.
A natural, if unfortunate, demise. Call the constable, have him taken away.
Yes, sir. I'll do it, ma'am.
Why are you telling them that?
This lot have still got one foot in the Dark Ages.
If I tell them the truth, they'll panic and think it was witchcraft.
Okay, what was it, then?
Witchcraft.
DOOMFINGER: The potion is prepared.
Now, take it.
Magic words for the playwright's fevered mind.
Shakespeare will release us.
The mind of a genius will unlock the tide of blood.
Upon this night, the work is done.
A muse to pen Love's Labour's Won, I got you a room, Sir Doctor.
You and Miss Jones are just across the landing.
Poor Lynley. So many strange events.
Not least of all, this land of Freedonia where a woman can be a doctor.
Where a woman can be what she likes, And you, Sir Doctor. How can a man so young have eyes so old?
I do a lot of reading.
A trite reply, yeah? That's what I do.
And you, you look at him like you're surprised he exists.
He's as much of a puzzle to you as he is to me.
I think we should say good night.
I must to work. I have a play to complete.
I'll get my answers tomorrow, Doctor, and I'll discover more about you and why this constant performance of yours.
All the world's a stage.
Hmm. I might use that.
Good night, Doctor.
Nighty-night, Shakespeare.
It's not exactly five star, is it?
Oh, it'll do. I've seen worse.
I haven't even got a toothbrush.
Ooh, um...
Contains Venusian spearmint.
So, who's going where? I mean, there's only one bed.
We'll manage. Come on.
So, magic and stuff. That's a surprise.
It's all a bit Harry Potter.
Wait till you read book seven. Oh, I cried!
But is it real, though? I mean, witches, black magic and all that, it's real?
~Course it isn't!
Well, how am I supposed to know?
I've only just started believing in time travel. Give me a break.
Looks like witchcraft, but it isn't.
It can't be. Are you gonna stand there all night?
Budge up a bit, then.
Sorry, there's not much room.
Us two here, same bed. Tongues will wag.
There's such a thing as psychic energy, but a human couldn't channel it like that.
Not without a generator the size of Taunton, and I think we'd have spotted that. No.
There's something I'm missing, Martha.
Something really close.
It's staring me right in the face, and I can't see it.
Rose would know.
A friend of mine, Rose, right now she'd say exactly the right thing.
Still, can't be helped. You're a novice, never mind.
I'll take you back home tomorrow.
Great!
Bind the mind and take the man.
Speed the words to writer's hand.
Will I finished cleaning, just in time for your special treat.
Oh, aye. I'm not the first, then.
I'll take that to aid my flight and you shall speak no more this night.
(SCREAMING) What?
SHAKESPEARE: What was that?
(CACKLING) Her heart gave out.
She died of fright.
Doctor?
What did you see?
A witch.
SHAKESPEARE: Oh, sweet Dolly Bailey.
She sat out three bouts of the plague in this place. We all ran like rats.
But what could have scared her so? She had such enormous spirit.
Rage, rage, against the dying of the light.
I might use that.
You can't, it's someone else's.
But the thing is, Lynley drowned on dry land, Dolly died of fright and they were both connected to you.
You're accusing me?
No, but I saw a witch, big as you like, flying, cackling away, and you've written about witches.
I have? When was that?
Not... Not quite yet.
Peter Streete spoke of witches.
Who's Peter Streete?
Our builder. He sketched the plans for the Globe.
The architect?
Hold on. The architect. The architect! The Globe! Come on!
Columns there, right, and 14 sides.
I've always wondered, but I've never asked.
Tell me, Will, why 14 sides?
It was the shape Peter Streete thought best, that’s all.
He said it carried the sound well.
14?
Why does that ring a bell? 14?
There's 14 lines in a sonnet.
So there is, Good point. Words and shapes following the same design.
14 lines, 14 sides, 14 facets... My head!
Tetradecagon, think, think, think!
Words, letters, numbers, lines!
This is just a theatre!
Oh, yeah, but a theatre's magic, isn’t it?
You should know. You stand on this stage, say the right words with the right emphasis at the right time.
Oh, you can make men weep or cry with joy.
Change them.
You can change peoples’ minds just with words in this place.
And if you exaggerate that...
It's like your police box. Small, wooden box with all that power inside.
Oh! Oh, Martha Jones, I like you. Tell you what, Peter Streete would know.
Can I talk to him?
You won't get an answer.
A month after finishing this place, he lost his mind.
Why, what happened?
He started raving about witches, hearing voices, babbling.
His mind was addled.
Where is he now?
Bedlam.
What's Bedlam?
Bethlem Hospital, the madhouse.
We gotta go there, right now. Come on!
Wait, I'm coming with you. I want to witness this at first hand.
Ralph! The last scene, as promised.
Copy it, hand it around, learn it, speak it.
Back before curtain up, and remember, kid, project!
Eyes and teeth. You never know, the Queen might turn up.
As if. She never does.
So, tell me of Freedonia, where women can be doctors, writers, actors.
This country's ruled by a woman.
Ah, she's royal, that's God's business. Though you are a royal beauty.
Whoa, nelly! I know for a fact you've got a wife in the country.
But, Martha, this is town.
Come on, we can all have a good flirt later!
Is that a promise, Doctor?
Oh, 57 academics just punched the air. Now, move!
Love's Labour's Won.
I don't think much of sequels, they're never as good as the original.
Have you seen this last bit?
Must have been dozing off when he wrote that. I don't even know what it means.
Well, that goes for most of his stuff. Ah, but at least it's my speech.
(LAUGHS) I get centre stage.
“The light of Shadmoch’s hollow moon “doth shine on to a point in space, "betwixt Dravidian shore..." (WIND GUSTING) What was that?
"Dravidian shores, linear 5-9-3-0-1-6..." A spirit stirs the ether.
But too soon, too soon!
Not to fear, my mothers.
‘tis merely a rehearsal of what's to come.
"and strikes the fulsome grove of Rexel 4." By all the saints.
It's a spirit.
(SQUAWKING) It's a vile shade.
(SHRIEKING) I think we should never speak of this again.
Else we'll end up in Bedlam ourselves.
(PATIENTS WAILING) Please, please!
Does my lord Doctor wish some entertainment while he waits?
I can whip these madmen. They'll put on a good show for you.
Bandog and Bedlam.
No, I don't.
Well, wait here, my lords, while I, um...
Make him decent for the lady.
So this is what you call a hospital, yeah?
Where the patients are whipped to entertain the gentry?
And you put your friend in here?
Oh, it's all so different in Freedonia.
But you're clever! Do you honestly think this place is any good?
I've been mad, I've lost my mind.
Fear of this place set me right again. Serves its purpose.
Mad in what way?
You lost your son.
My only boy. The Black Death took him.
I wasn't even there, I didn't know, I'm sorry.
Made me question everything.
The futility of this fleeting existence, to be or not to be.
Oh, that’s quite good.
You should write that down.
Hmm, maybe not. A bit pretentious?
This way, my lord.
(PATIENTS WAILING) They can be dangerous, my lord. Don't know their own strength.
I think it helps if you don't whip them. Now, get out!
Peter.
Peter Streete.
He's the same as he was. You'll get nothing out of him.
Peter.
What is this?
I must see!
That stranger...
He was at the inn with Shakespeare.
I thought then he smelt of something new.
Now he visits the madhouse, The architect!
Peter, I'm the Doctor.
Go into the past.
One year ago.
Let your mind go back.
Back to when everything was fine and shiny.
Everything that happened in this year since happened to somebody else.
It's just a story.
A winter's tale.
Let go.
That's it. That's it.
Just let go.
(GASPING) Tell me the story, Peter.
Tell me about the witches.
Who is this Doctor? Why does he come now at our time of glory?
Doomfinger, transport yourself.
Doom the Doctor.
Doom his hide.
Witches spoke to Peter.
In the night, they whispered, they whispered...
Got Peter to build the Globe to their design, their design!
The 14 walls.
Always 14.
When the work was done...
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY) They snapped poor Peter's wits.
Well, where did Peter see the witches? Where in the city?
Peter, tell me!
You've got to tell me. Where were they?
All Hallows Street, Too many words!
What the hell?
Just one touch of the heart.
No!
A witch! I'm seeing a witch!
Now, who would be next, hmm?
Just one touch.
Oh, I'll stop your frantic hearts.
Poor, fragile mortals.
Let us out! Let us out!
That's not going to work. The whole building's shouting that.
And who would die first, hmm?
Well, if you're looking for volunteers...
No, don't!
Doctor, can you stop her?
No mortal has power over me!
No, but there's a power in words.
If I can find the right one, if | can just know you...
None on Earth has knowledge of us.
Well, it's a good thing I'm here. Now, think, think, think.
Humanoid, female, who uses shapes and words to channel energy...
Ah, 14!
That's it, 14!
The 14 stars of the Rexel planetary configuration!
Creature, I name you Carrionite!
(SHRIEKING) What did you do?
I named her.
The power of a name. That's old magic.
But there's no such thing as magic.
Well, it's just a different sort of science. You lot, you chose mathematics.
Given the right string of numbers, the right equation, you can split the atom.
The Carrionites use words instead.
Use them for what?
The end of the world.
(WHEEZING) He knows us!
He spoke our name!
Then he will know death. He will perish at my hand.
(BELL CHIMING) My mothers, the time approaches.
You must away to the Globe. Go, I will join you.
As soon as this Doctor screams his last.
The Carrionites disappeared way back at the dawn of the universe.
Nobody was sure if they were real or legend.
Well, I'm going for real.
But what do they want?
A new empire on Earth.
A world of bones and blood and witchcraft.
But how?
I'm looking at the man with the words.
Me? But I've done nothing.
Hold on, though. What were you doing last night when that Carrionite was in the room?
Finishing the play.
What happens on the last page?
The boys get the girls, they have a bit of a dance.
It's all as funny and thought-provoking as usual.
Except those last few lines.
Funny thing is, I don't actually remember writing them.
That's it!
They used you. They gave you the final words.
Like a spell, like a code. Love's Labour's Won, it's a weapon!
The right combination of words spoken in the right place with the shape of the Globe as an energy converter!
The play is the thing!
And yes, you can have that.
We left the lovers of Navarre, by cruel chance separated, none to claim his heart, their labours lost.
Now will they find love's labour's won?
All Hallows Street, there it is. Martha, we'll track them down.
Will, you get to the Globe. Whatever you do, stop that play!
I'll do it. All these years, I've been the cleverest man around.
Next to you, I know nothing.
Well, don't complain.
I'm not! It's marvellous.
Good luck, Doctor.
Good luck, Shakespeare.
Once more unto the breach!
I like that!
Wait a minute, that's one of mine.
Oh, just shift!
The eye should have contentment where it rests...
Patience, my sisters. Patience.
.. mewling poor, drooped men...
Stop the play!
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but stop.
This performance must end immediately.
Oh, everyone's a critic.
The wordsmith!
Fear not.
I have the doll.
I'm sorry. You'll get a refund.
But this play must not be performed.
Is he drunk, or what?
Get him out of the way!
You must forgive our irksome Will.
He's been on the beer, and feeling ill.
There is naught can stop us now.
All Hallows Street, Which house?
Thing is, though, am I missing something here?
The world didn't end in 1599, it just didn’t. Look at me, I'm living proof.
Oh, how to explain the mechanics of the infinite temporal flux?
I know, Back to the Future! It's like Back to the Future.
The film?
No, the novelisation. Yes, the film!
Marty McFly goes back and changes history.
And he starts fading away... Oh, my God, am I going to fade?
You and the entire future of the human race.
It ends right now, in 1599, if we don't stop it.
But which house?
(CREAKING) Make that witch house.
I take it we're expected?
Oh, I think death has been waiting for you a very long time.
Right then, it's my turn.
I know how to do this.
I name thee Carrionite!
(GASPS) What did I do wrong? Was it the finger?
Power of a name works only once. Observe.
I gaze upon this bag of bones, and now I name thee, Martha Jones.
What have you done?
Only sleeping, alas.
It's curious, her name has less impact.
She's somehow out of her time.
And as for you, Sir Doctor.
Fascinating.
There is no name, Why would a man hide his title in such despair?
Oh, but look.
There's still one word with a power that aches.
The naming won't work on me.
But your heart grows cold.
The north wind blows and carries down the distant...
Rose.
Oh, big mistake. ‘Cause that name keeps me fighting.
The Carrionites vanished. Where did you go?
The Eternals found the right word to banish us into deep darkness.
Then how did you escape?
New words.
New and glittering.
From a mind like no other.
Shakespeare.
His son perished.
The grief of a genius.
Grief without measure, Madness enough to allow us entrance.
How many of you?
Just the three.
But the play tonight shall restore the rest.
Then the human race will be purged as pestilence.
And from this world we will lead the universe back into the old ways of blood and magic.
Mmm, busy schedule.
But first, you've got to get past me.
Oh, that should be a pleasure.
Considering my enemy has such a handsome shape.
Now, that's one form of magic that's definitely not gonna work on me.
Oh, we'll see.
(SCISSORS SNIPPING) What was that for? What did you do?
Souvenir.
Well, give it back!
Well, that's just cheating.
Behold, Doctor. Men to Carrionites are nothing but puppets.
Now, you might call that magic, I'd call that a DNA replication module.
What use is your science now?
Oh, my God, Doctor!
Don't worry, I've got you.
Hold on, mister. Two hearts?
I'm making a habit of it.
I've only got one heart working!
How do you people cope?
I've got to get the other one started. Hit me! Hit me on the chest!
Other side!
Now, on the back, on the back!
(GRUNTING) Left a bit!
Lovely. There we go. By-da-boom-ba!
Well, what are you standing there for? Come on, the Globe!
The Doctor?
Dead.
The ladies have prepared a show.
Maria means to present Isis to send him from the dewy orb of heaven.
Ah! Here comes Costard.
(ALL CHEERING) Masters.
We're going the wrong way!
No, we're not!
DOCTOR: We're going the wrong way!
Behold the swinish sight of woman's love.
Pish! It's out of season to be heavy disposed.
It is now, my mothers.
The final words to activate the tetradecagon.
Betwixt Dravidian shores and linear 5-9-3-0-1-6-7 point 0-2, and strikes the fulsome grove of Rexel 4, Co-radiating crystal, activate!
The portal opens!
It begins!
I told thee so! I told thee!
Stage door!
(AUDIENCE SHRIEKING IN PANIC) (LAUGHING WICKEDLY) Stop the play! I think that was it. Yeah, I said stop the play!
I hit my head.
Yeah, don't rub it, you'll go bald.
I think that's my cue.
Now begins the millennium of blood!
The Doctor! He lives.
Then watch this world become a blasted heath.
They come, they come!
Come on, Will, history needs you.
But what can I do?
Reverse it!
How am I supposed to do that?
The shape of the Globe gives words power, but you're the wordsmith.
The one true genius, the only man clever enough to do it.
But what words? I have none ready.
You're William Shakespeare!
But these Carrionite phrases, they need such precision.
Trust yourself. When you're locked away in your room, the words just come, don't they? Like magic.
Words of the right sound, the right shape, the right rhythm, words that last forever!
That's what you do, Will. You choose perfect words.
Do it! Improvise!
Close up this din of hateful, dire decay, decomposition of your witches’ plot!
You thieve my brains, consider me your toy, my doting Doctor tells me I am not!
No!
Words of power!
Foul Carrionite spectres, cease your show, between the points...
7-6-1-3-9-0!
7-6-1-3-9-0!
Banished like a tinker's cuss, I say to thee...
Uh...
Expelliarmus!
Expelliarmus!
Expelliarmus!
Good old JK!
(SHRIEKING) The deep darkness!
They are consumed!
Love's Labour's Won, there it goes.
(AUDIENCE GASPING) (HESITANT APPLAUSE) (ALL CHEERING) They think it was all special effects?
Your effect is special, indeed.
It's not your best line.
(SHRIEKING) And I say, a heart for a hart, a dear for a deer.
I don't get it.
Then give me a joke from Freedonia.
Okay, Shakespeare walks into a pub, and the landlord says, "Oi, mate, you're Bard.” (LAUGHING) That's brilliant!
Doesn't make sense, mind you, but never mind that. Come here.
I've only just met you.
The Doctor may never kiss you. Why not entertain a man who will?
I don't know how to tell you this, O Great Genius, but your breath doesn’t half stink.
Good prop store back there!
I'm not sure about this, though.
Reminds me of a Sycorax.
Sycorax. Nice word. I'll have that off you as well.
I should be on 10%. How's your head?
Still aching.
Here, I got you this.
Neck brace, Wear that for a few days until it's better.
Although you might want to keep it, it suits you.
What about the play?
Gone. I looked all over.
Every single copy of Love's Labour's Won went up in the sky.
My lost masterpiece.
You could write it up again.
Yeah, better not, Will.
There's still power in those words. Maybe it should best stay forgotten.
Oh, but I've got new ideas.
Perhaps it's time I wrote about fathers and sons, in memory of my boy, my precious Hamnet.
Hamnet?
That's him.
Ham-net?
What's wrong with that?
Anyway, time we were off.
I've got a nice attic in the Tardis where this lot can scream for all eternity.
And I've got to take Martha back to Freedonia.
You mean travel on through time and space?
You what?
You're from another world, like the Carrionites.
And Martha here's from the future. It's not hard to work out.
That's incredible. You are incredible.
We're alike in many ways, Doctor.
Martha, let me say goodbye to you with a new verse.
A sonnet for my dark lady.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely, more temperate...
Will! “Will!
Will, you'll never believe it. She's here!
She's turned up!
We're the talk of the town.
She heard about last night. She wants us to perform it again.
Who?
Her Majesty. She's here!
(TRUMPETS HERALDING) Queen Elizabeth 1!
Doctor!
What?
My sworn enemy.
What?
Off with his head!
What?
Well, never mind what, just run!
~See you, Will And thanks!
Stop him!
Stop that pernicious Doctor!
Stop! In the name of the Queen!
What have you done to upset her?
How should I know? I haven't met her yet! That's time travel for you.
Still, I can't wait to find out.
That's something to look forward to.
Ooh!
And we're slap-bang in the middle of New New York.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Salutations. This is Sally Calypso with the traffic news at 10:15.
We've got reports of a multiple stack-pile at Junction 509, with a spate of carjackings reported on New 5th Avenue.
So you take care now. Drive safely, (CRASHING) They're gonna get in. There's no stopping them.
The police are on their way, I promise. I've sounded the alarm.
Repeat, this is car 1-@-Hawk-5.
We have a problem, require urgent assistance.
OPERATOR: Thank you for your call. You have been placed on hold.
It's all your fault.
You lied to the computer. You said there were three of us.
You told them three!
Repeat, urgent assistance. Car 1-Q-Hawk-5.
This is an emergency. Help us!
Oh, my God, I'm begging you! Please, help us!
The weather is at 36 degrees, and it's smooth skies all the way home.
This is Sally Calypso signing off. Missing you already.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Just one trip, that's what I said. One trip in the Tardis and then home.
Although, I suppose we could stretch the definition.
Take one trip into the past, one trip into the future.
How do you fancy that?
No complaints from me!
How about a different planet?
Can we go to yours?
No, there's plenty of other places.
Come on. I mean, the planet of the Time Lords.
That's got to be worth a look. What's it like?
It's beautiful, yeah.
Is it like, you know, outer space cities, all spires and stuff?
I suppose it is.
Great big temples and cathedrals?
Yeah.
Lots of planets in the sky?
The sky's a burnt orange.
With a citadel enclosed in a mighty glass dome, shining under the twin suns.
Beyond that, the mountains go on forever.
Slopes of deep red grass, capped with snow.
Can we go there?
Nah! Where's the fun for me? I don't want to go home.
Instead...
This is much better. Year 5000000053. Planet New Earth.
Second home of mankind. 50,000 light years from your old world, and we're slap-bang in the middle of New New York.
Although, technically, it's 15 New Yorks since the original, so it's New New New New New New New New New New New New New New New New York.
One of the most dazzling cities ever built.
Oh, that's nice.
A Time Lord version of dazzling!
A bit of rain never hurt anyone. Come on, let's get under cover.
He has arrived.
What should I do?
Find him before it's too late.
Well, it looks like the same old Earth to me, on a Wednesday afternoon.
Hold on, hold on, let's have a look.
(POUNDING) .. nd the driving should be clear and easy, with 15 extra lanes open for the New New jersey Expressway.
That's more like it! That's the view we had last time.
This must be the lower levels.
Down at the base of the tower. Some sort of undercity.
You've brought me to the slums?
Much more interesting. It's all cocktails and glitter up there.
“This is the real city.
You'd enjoy anything.
That's me. Ah, the rain's stopping. Better and better!
When you say last time, was that you and Rose?
Um, yeah. Yeah, it was. Yeah.
You're taking me to the same planets that you took her?
What's wrong with that?
Nothing. Just ever heard the word "rebound"?
Oh, you should have said! How long have you been there?
Happy. You want happy. Happy!
Customers, customers! We've got customers!
We have business.
(WOMAN SHOUTING) Happy, happy, lovely happy!
Anger. Buy some anger!
It's mellow, makes you feel all bendy and soft all day long.
Don't go to them, they'll rip you off. Do you want some happy?
No, thanks.
Are they selling drugs?
I think they're selling moods.
Same thing, isn’t it?
WOMAN: Over here, sweetheart!
Hey, you, over here! Over here!
Come over here, yeah. And what can I get you, my love?
I want to buy forget. I've got forget, my darling.
What strength? How much do you want forgetting?
It's my mother and father. They went on the motorway.
Oh, that's a swine.
Try this. Forget 43. That's 2 credits.
Sorry, but hold on a minute. What happened to your parents?
They drove off.
Yeah, but they might drive back.
Everyone goes to the motorway in the end.
I've lost them.
But they can't have gone far. You could find them.
No. No, no, don't!
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
Your parents.
Your mother and father. They're on the motorway.
Are they?
That's nice, I'm sorry, I won't keep you.
So that's the human race five billion years in the future?
Off their heads on chemicals.
Sorry. I'm really sorry. We just need three, that’s all.
Let her go! I'm warning you!
It's not our fault!
Whatever you want, I can help. We can help.
But first you've got to let her go! Sorry.
(DOOR SLAMS) (BUZZING) The Doctor is so gonna kill you. Never mind him, I'm gonna kill you myself!
Let go of me!
Give her some sleep.
Don't you dare! Don't put that near me.
It's just sleep. It won't do you any harm if you don't fight it.
That's it, come on. That's it.
Get on board.
Engaging antigravs. Hold on.
Martha!
She's all right, she's breathing. Pulse is fine.
No harm done.
She looks rich. She must have got lost.
Well, she's worth her weight in gold to us.
This is car 4-6-5-Diamond-6. We have three passengers, repeat, three.
Request access to the fast lane.
Access granted.
Oh, yes.
I thought you'd come back. Do you want some happy-happy?
Those people, who were they? Where did they take her?
They've taken her to the motorway.
Looked like carjackers to me.
I'd give up now, darling. You won't see her again.
Used to be thriving, this place. You couldn't move.
But they all go to the motorway in the end.
He kept on saying three, we need three. What did he mean, three?
It's the car-sharing policy, to save fuel.
You get special access if you're carrying three adults.
This motorway, how do I get there?
This motorway, how do I get there?
Straight down the alley, keep going to the end. You cannae miss it.
Tell you what, buy some happy-happy. Then you'll be smiling, my love.
A word of advice to all of you.
Cash up, close down and pack your bags.
Why is that, then?
Because as soon as I've found her alive and well, and I will find her alive and well, then I'm coming back.
And this street is closing. Tonight!
(DISTANT VOICES) MAN: Now you just settle back. It's all gonna be worth it.
WOMAN: ... the view from the windows, you can see all the way out to the...
Open sky. They say the air smells like apple grass. Can you imagine?
MAN: The houses are made of wood.
There are jobs going in the foundries. Everyone says so.
Take me back. Whoever you are, just take me back to my friend.
That's all I want. I won't cause any trouble, just take me back.
I'm sorry. That's not a real gun.
Well, you would say that.
Where do you get a gun from these days?
I wouldn't even know how to fire.
No, nor me.
Okay.
What's your name?
Martha. Martha Jones.
Well, I'm Cheen and this is Milo.
And I swear, we're sorry. We're really, really sorry.
We just needed access to the fast lane, but I promise as soon as we arrive, we'll drop you off, and you can go back and find your friend.
Seriously?
I swear. Look, honesty patch.
All the same, it's still kidnapping. Where are we anyway?
We're on the motorway.
What's that then, fog?
It's exhaust fumes.
We're going out to Brooklyn. Everyone says the air is so much cleaner.
And we couldn't stay at Pharmacy Town because...
Well, ‘cause of me. I'm pregnant.
We only discovered it last week. Scan says it's gonna be a boy.
Right. What do I do now, congratulate my kidnappers?
We're not kidnappers. Not really.
No! You're idiots!
You're having a baby and you're wearing that?
Not any more.
This will be as fast as we can.
We'll take the motorway to the Brooklyn flyover and then it's gonna take a while "cause then there's no fast lane, just ordinary roads, but at least it's direct.
It's only 10 miles.
How long is it gonna take?
About six years.
What?
It'll be just in time for him to start school.
No, sorry, hold on. Six years?
Ten miles in six years? How come?
(HORN HONKING) (COUGHING) (CARS HONKING) Hey! You daft little street strut! What are you doing standing there?
Either get out or get in. Come on!
MAN: Did you ever see the like?
Here you go.
He was just standing there, breathing it in.
There's this story. It says back in the old days, on Junction 47, this woman stood in the exhaust fumes for a solid 20 minutes.
By the time they found her, her head had swollen to 50 feet.
Oh, you're making it up!
A50-foot head. Just think of it.
Imagine picking that nose.
Oh, stop it. That's disgusting.
What, did you never pick your nose?
Bran, we're moving.
Right, I'm there. I'm on it.
(HORNS BLARING) Twenty yards. We're having a good day.
And who might you be, sir? Very well dressed for a hitchhiker.
Thanks. Sorry, I'm the Doctor.
Medical man? My name's Thomas Kincade Brannigan, and this is the bane of my life, the lovely Valerie.
Nice to meet you.
And that's the rest of the family behind you.
Oh, that's nice.
(MEOWING) Hello.
How old are they?
Just two months.
Poor little souls. They've never known the ground beneath their paws.
Children of the motorway.
What, they were born in here?
We couldn't stop.
We heard there were jobs going, out in the laundries on Fire Island.
Thought we'd take a chance.
You've been driving for two months?
Do I look like a teenager? We've been driving for 12 years now.
Sorry?
Yeah, started out as newlyweds. Feels like yesterday.
Feels like 12 years to me.
Ah, sweetheart, but you still love me.
Twelve years? How far did you come? Where did you start?
Battery Park. It's five miles back.
You travelled five miles in 12 years?
I think he's a bit slow.
Where are you from?
Never mind that. I've got to get out!
My friend's in one of these cars. She was taken hostage.
I should get back to the Tardis.
You're too late for that. We've passed the lay-by.
You're a passenger now, sonny Jim.
When's the next lay-by?
Oh, six months.
(HORNS BLARING) How many cars are out there?
I don't think anyone knows.
Here we go. Hungry?
Oh, thanks.
How far down is it to this fast lane?
It's right at the bottom, underneath the traffic jam.
Not many people can afford three passengers, so it's empty down there.
Rumour has it you can reach up to 30 miles per hour.
Wow, that's like, crazy.
But how are you supposed to live inside this thing? It's tiny!
Oh, we stocked up.
We've got self-replicating fuel, muscle stimulants for exercise, there's a chemical toilet at the back and all waste products are recycled as food.
Okay.
Oh, now, a gap. This is brilliant!
Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6 on descent to fast lane. Thank you very much.
I need to talk to the police.
Thank you for your call. You have been placed on hold.
You're the police!
Thank you for your call. You have been placed on hold.
Is there anyone else? I once met the Duke of Manhattan.
Is there any way of getting through to him?
Oh, now, ain't you lordly? I've got to find my friend!
You can't make outside calls. The motorway's completely enclosed.
What about the other cars?
We've got contact with them, yeah. Well, some of them anyway.
They've got to be on your friends’ list. Now, let's see, who's near by?
Ah, the Cassini sisters!
Be still your hearts, my handsome girls. It's Brannigan here.
Get off the line, Brannigan. You're a pest and a menace.
Come on now, sisters, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
You know full well we're not sisters. We're married.
Ooh! Stop that modern talk, I'm an old-fashioned cat.
Now, I've got a hitchhiker here, calls himself the Doctor.
Hello. Sorry, I'm looking for someone called Martha Jones.
She's been carjacked.
She's inside one of these vehicles, but I don't know which one.
Wait a minute, Could I ask what entrance did they use?
Where were we?
Pharmacy Town.
Pharmacy Town, about 20 minutes ago.
Let's have a look.
Just my luck to marry a car-spotter.
In the last half hour, 53 new cars joined from the Pharmacy Town junction.
Anything more specific?
All in good time.
Was she carjacked by two people?
Yes, she was. Yeah.
There we are! Just one of those cars was destined for the fast lane.
That means they had three on board.
And the car number is 4-6-5-Diamond-6.
That's it! So how do we find them?
Ah. Now there I'm afraid I can’t help.
We can call them on this thing. We've got their number, Diamond-6.
Not if they're designated fast lane. It's a different class.
You could try the police.
They put me on hold.
You'll have to keep trying. There's no one else, Thank you.
(ALL HONKING) See? Another ten layers to go, and we're scorching.
(RUMBLING) What's that?
It's coming from underneath.
It's that noise, isn't it? It's like Kate said, the stories, they're true!
What stories?
It's the sound of the air vents, that's all.
Exhaust fumes travel down, so at the base of the tunnel they've got air vents.
No, but the stories are much better.
They say people go missing on the motorway.
Some cars just vanish, never to be seen again, ‘cause there's something living down there in the smoke.
Something huge and hungry.
And if you get lost on the road, it's waiting for you.
(SNARLING) Well, like I said, air vents.
Going down to the next layer.
Except, look out there. Does it look like the air vents are working?
No.
(GROWLING) So what's that, then?
Nah, kids' stuff.
Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6, on descent.
We've got to go to the fast lane. Take me down.
Not in a million years.
You've got three passengers.
I'm still not going.
She's alone and she's lost.
She doesn't even belong on this planet, and it’s all my fault.
I'm asking you, Brannigan, take me down.
That's a no, and that's final.
I'm not risking the children down there.
Why not? What's the risk? What happens down there?
We're not discussing it. The conversation is closed.
So we keep on driving?
Yes, we do.
For how long? Till the journey's end.
Mrs Cassini, this is the Doctor.
Tell me, how long have you been driving on the motorway?
Oh, we were amongst the first.
It's been 23 years now.
And in all that time, have you ever seen a police car?
I'm not sure.
Look at your notes. Any police?
Not as such.
Or an ambulance?
Rescue service? Anything official, ever?
I can't keep a note of everything.
What if there's no one out there?
Stop it. The Cassinis were doing you a favour.
Someone's got to ask, ‘cause you might not talk about it, but it's there, in your eyes.
What if the traffic jam never stops?
There's a whole city above us. The mighty city-state of New New York.
They wouldn't just leave us.
In that case, where are they? Hmm?
What if there's no help coming, not ever?
What if there's nothing?
Just the motorway?
With the cars going round and round and round, never stopping? Forever!
Shut up! Just shut up!
This is Sally Calypso, and it's that time again.
The sun is blazing high in the sky over the New Atlantic.
The perfect setting for the daily contemplation.
You think you know us so well, Doctor.
We are not abandoned. Not while we have each other.
This is for all of you out there on the roads.
We're so sorry.
Drive safe, (OLD RUGGED CROSS PLAYING ON TV MONITOR) # On a hill far away # Stood an old rugged cross # The emblem of suffering and shame ALL: # And I love that old cross # Where the dearest and best # For a world of lost sinners was slain # So I'll cherish the old rugged cross # Rugged cross # Till my trophies at last I lay down # I will cling to the old rugged cross # Rugged cross # And exchange it some day for a crown # Fast lane access. Please drive safely.
We made it. The fast lane.
If you won't take me, I'll go there on my own.
What do you think you're doing?
Finding my own way. I usually do.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Capsule open.
Here we go.
Look after this.
I love that coat. Janis Joplin gave me that coat.
But you can't jump!
If it's any consolation, Valerie, right now I'm having kittens.
This Martha, she must mean an awful lot to you.
Hardly know her.
I was too busy showing off.
And I lied to her.
I couldn't help it, just lied.
Bye, then!
He's completely insane!
That, and a bit magnificent!
Capsule open.
Who the hell are you?
Sorry, motorway foot patrol. I'm doing a survey.
How are you enjoying your motorway?
Well, not very much. Junction 5's been closed for three years.
Thank you, your comments have been noted. Have a nice day!
Capsule open.
Capsule open.
Thank you for your cooperation. Your comments have been noted.
Do you mind if I borrow this? Not my colour, but thank you very much!
Capsule open.
Oh, don't mind me.
Capsule open.
Capsule open.
Try again.
Brooklyn turn off 1, closed.
Try the next one.
Brooklyn turn off 2, closed.
What do we do?
We keep going round, we'll do the whole loop, by the time we come back round, they'll be open.
(GROWLING) You still calling that air vents?
What else could it be?
(GROWLING) What the hell is that?
It's just the hydraulics.
Sounds like it's alive!
It's all exhaust fumes out there. Nothing could breathe in that.
WOMAN: Calling car 4-6-5-Diamond-6. Repeat, calling car 4-6-5-Diamond-6.
This is 4-6-5-Diamond-6. Who's that? Where are you?
I'm in the fast lane, about 5@ yards behind.
Can you get back up? Can you get off the fast lane?
We only have permission to go down. We need the Brooklyn Flyover.
It's closed. Go back up.
We can't. We'll just go round.
Don't you understand? They're closed, they're always closed.
We're stuck down here. There's something else out there in the fog.
Can't you hear it?
(ROARING) That's the air vents.
Jehovah, what are you, some stupid kid?
Get out of here!
(WOMAN SCREAMING) What was that?
We can't move. It got us.
What's happening?
What's got you? What is it?
I don't know...
(ROARING) (SCREAMING) Hello?
Just drive, you idiots!
Get out of here!
No! ~Can you hear me? Hello?
Just drive! Do what she said, get us out of here!
But where?
Just straight ahead! And fast!
What is it? What's out there? What's happening?
Capsule open.
Excuse me! Is that legal?
Sorry, motorway foot patrol.
Whatever. Have you got any water?
Certainly. Never let it be said I've lost my manners.
Is this the last layer?
We're right at the bottom. Nothing below us but the fast lane.
~Can we drive down?
There's only two of us.
You need three to go down. ~Couldn't we cheat?
I'd love to, but it's an automated system. The wheel would lock.
Then excuse me.
You can't jump, it's 1,000 feet down!
No, I just want a look.
(ROARING) What's that noise?
I try not to think about it.
What are those lights? What's down there?
I just need to see.
There must be some sort of ventilation.
If I could just transmit a pulse through this thing, I could trip the system.
Give us a bit of a breeze.
(DRILLING) Just what we need! Pirates!
I'm calling the police!
The Doctor, where is he?
That's it! Might shift the fumes a bit, give us a good look.
(SCREECHING) What are those shapes?
They're alive.
What the hell are they?
Macra.
Go faster! I'm at full speed!
No access above.
But this is an emergency!
Thank you for your call. You have been placed on hold.
Turn everything off!
You've got to be joking!
Listen, it's all fog out there, so how can they see us?
Maybe it's the engine, the sound, or the heat or the light, I don't know.
But if you turn everything off, they might not be able to find us.
What if you're wrong?
It can't be worse than this. Just do it!
(MACRA RETREATING) CHEEN: They've stopped.
Yeah, but they're still out there.
How did you think of that?
I saw it in a film.
They used to do it in submarines.
Trouble is, I can't remember what they did next.
Well, you'd better think of something, ‘cause we've lost the air-con.
If we don't switch the engines back on, we won't be able to breathe.
How long have we got?
Eight minutes maximum.
The Macra used to be the scourge of this galaxy. Gas.
They fed off gas. The filthier, the better.
They built up a small empire using humans as slaves and mining gas for food.
They don’t exactly look like empire-builders to me.
Well, that was billions of years ago.
Billions. They must have devolved down the years. Now they're just beasts.
But they're still hungry, and my friend's down there.
(BANGING) It's like New Times Square in here! For goodness sake!
DOCTOR: I've invented a sport!
Doctor! You're a hard man to find.
No guns! I'm not having guns!
I only brought this in case of pirates.
Doctor, you've got to come with me.
Do I know you?
You haven't aged at all.
Time has been less kind to me.
Novice Hame!
Whoa, hold on. Get off!
Last time we met, you were breeding humans for experimentation.
I've sought forgiveness, Doctor, for so many years under his guidance.
And if you come with me, I might finally be able to redeem myself.
I'm not going anywhere. You've got Macra living underneath this city. Macra!
If my friend's still alive, she's stuck down there!
You've got to come with me right now!
No, you're coming with me. We've got three passengers now.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but the situation is even worse than you can imagine.
Transport.
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!
(DOCTOR GROANING) Rough teleport. Ow!
You can go straight back down and teleport people out, starting with Martha!
I only had the power for one trip.
Then get some more! Where are we?
High above, in the Overcity.
Good, ‘cause you can tell the senate of New New York I'd like a word.
They have got thousands of people trapped on the motorway! Millions!
But you're inside the senate, right now.
May the goddess Santori bless thee.
They died, Doctor.
The city died.
How long has it been like this?
24 years.
All of them? Everyone? What happened?
A new chemical. A new mood.
They called it “bliss”.
Everyone tried it. They couldn't stop.
A virus mutated inside the compound and became airborne.
Everything perished. Even the virus in the end.
It killed the world in seven minutes flat.
There was just enough time to close down the walkways and the flyovers, sealing off the Undercity.
Those people on the motorway aren't lost, Doctor.
They were saved.
So the whole thing down there is running on automatic.
There's not enough power to get them out.
We did all we could to stop the system from choking.
Who's we? How did you survive?
He protected me.
And he has waited for you these long years.
Doctor.
The Face of Boe!
I knew you would come.
Back in the old days, I was made his nurse as penance for my sin.
Old friend, what happened to you?
A failing.
He protected me from the virus by shrouding me in his smoke.
But with no one to maintain it, the city's power died.
The Undercity would have fallen into the sea, So he saved them.
The Face of Boe wired himself into the mainframe.
He's giving his life force just to keep things running.
But there are planets out there. You could have called for help.
The last act of the senate was to declare New Earth unsafe.
The automatic quarantine lasts for 100 years.
(THE FACE OF BOE GASPING) So the two of you stayed here.
On your own for all these years.
We had no choice.
Yes, you did.
Save them, Doctor.
Save them.
How much air is left?
Two minutes, There's always the Doctor.
That friend of mine.
He might think of something.
Martha, no one's coming.
He looked kind of nice.
He's a bit more than that.
Are you and him...
Sometimes I think he likes me, but sometimes I just think he needs someone with him.
I never even asked. Where's home?
A long way away.
I didn't really think. I just followed the Doctor and...
They don't even know where I am.
My mum and dad.
If I died here, they'd never know.
So, um, who is he, then? This Doctor?
I don't know.
Well, not really.
There's so much he never says.
But that means that the only hope right now is a complete stranger.
Well, that's no use!
But it is, though.
Because you haven't seen the things he can do.
Honestly, just trust me. Both of you.
You've got your faith, you've got your songs and your hymns, and I've got the Doctor.
Right.
Systems back online.
Good luck.
And you.
(GROWLING) Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6, it still registers! That's Martha.
I knew she was good. Novice Hame, hold that in place.
Take the residual energy, convert it, feed it through the electricity system.
But there isn't enough power.
Oh, you got power! You got me!
I'm brilliant with computers, just you watch.
Hame, every switch on that bank up to maximum!
I can't power up the city, but all the city needs is people.
So what are you going to do?
This!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
The transformers are blocked. The signal can't get through.
Doctor.
Yeah, hold on, not now.
I give you my last...
(GASPING) Hame, look after him!
Don't you go dying on me, you big old face.
You've got to see this.
The open road. Ha!
What in Jehovah was that?
It's coming from above!
What is it? What's happening?
Hold on, May.
Of all the cats in the kingdom.
What is it?
What is it?
Yes!
It's the sun!
Oh, Brannigan!
Children, it's the sunlight!
Sorry, no Sally Calypso, she was just a hologram. My name's the Doctor.
He's a magician.
And this is an order. Everyone drive up.
Right now.
Is he serious?
I've opened the roof of the motorway. Come on.
Throttle those engines. Drive up.
All of you, the whole Undercity, drive up.
Here we go.
Drive up. Drive up!
We've got to clear that fast lane.
Drive up and get out of the way.
BRANNIGAN: Here we go! Whoo!
Oi! Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6. Martha! Drive up!
“That's the Doctor!
We can't go up, we'll hit the lane!
Do as he says. Go up!
DOCTOR: You've got access above. Now, go!
It's daylight.
Oh, my God, that’s the sky. The real sky!
He did it!
I told you. He did it!
Did I tell you, Doctor, you're not bad, sir? You're not bad at all.
(BOTH EXCLAIMING) You keep driving, Brannigan. All the way up.
‘Cause it's here, just waiting for you.
The city of New New York, and it's yours.
And don't forget, I want that coat back.
I reckon that's a fair bargain, sir.
Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6, I've sent you a flight path, come to the senate.
MARTHA: On my way!
Quite a while since I saw you, Martha Jones.
Doctor!
Doctor?
Over here.
Doctor! What happened out there?
What's that?
It's the Face of Boe. It's all right, come say hello.
And this is Hame. She's a cat. Don't worry.
He's the one that saved you, not me.
My lord gave his life to save the city.
And now he’s dying.
No, don't say that. Not old Boe, plenty of life left.
It’s good to breathe the air once more.
Who is he?
I don't even know.
Legend says the Face of Boe has lived for billions of years.
Isn't that right?
And you're not about to give up now.
Everything has its time.
You know that, old friend, better than most.
The legend says more.
Don't. There's no need for that.
It says that the Face of Boe will speak his final secret to a traveller.
Yeah, but not yet. Who needs secrets, eh?
I have seen so much.
Perhaps too much.
I am the last of my kind, as you are the last of yours, Doctor.
That's why we have to survive.
Both of us.
Don't go.
I must, But know this, Time Lord.
You are not alone.
(SOBBING) All closed down.
Happy?
Happy-happy.
New New York can start again.
And they've got Novice Hame.
Just what every city needs, cats in charge. Come on, time we were off.
But what did he mean, the Face of Boe?
You are not alone?
I don't know.
You've got me. Is that what he meant?
I don't think so.
Sorry.
Then what?
Doesn't matter. Back to the Tardis, off we go.
Right, are you staying? Till you talk to me properly, yes.
He said, "Last of your kind." What does that mean?
It really doesn’t matter.
You don't talk. You never say. Why not?
(CITIZENS SINGING OLD RUGGED CROSS) It's the city.
They're singing.
I lied to you.
‘Cause I liked it.
I could pretend.
Just for a bit, I could imagine they were still alive.
Underneath a burnt orange sky.
I'm not just a Time Lord.
I'm the last of the Time Lords.
The Face of Boe was wrong, there's no one else.
What happened?
There was a war.
A Time War.
The last great Time War.
My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation, and they lost.
They lost. Everyone lost.
They're all gone now.
My family.
My friends. Even that sky.
You should have seen it, that old planet.
The second sun would rise in the south and the mountains would shine.
The leaves on the trees were silver.
When they caught the light every morning, it looked like a forest on fire.
When the autumn came, a breeze would blow through the branches. It sounded like a song...
MARTHA: It's the Statue of Liberty. I've always wanted to go to New York.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(BELL RINGING) Two minutes to curtain up, come on!
MAN: Two minutes to curtain up.
Where's Tallulah?
Where do you think?
Hey, Tallulah, leave him alone!
It's nearly show time, Laszlo, I gotta go.
Just promise me you'll come on Sunday, okay?
My mother will kill me if she doesn't get to meet you.
What if she doesn't like me?
Tallulah, she'll love you just as much as I do.
Oh! You say the sweetest things.
But it's true. Now promise me. Sunday, you'll come?
I promise. Cross my heart.
Oh, here take this, sweetheart. Wear it on stage and think of me.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Tallulah! I'm coming! Quit yelling!
How do I look?
Like an angel.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING) TALLULAH: Wish me luck, Laszlo.
Break a leg, sweetheart.
(SNORTING) Tallulah?
(SNORTING) Who's there?
(SNORTING) Hello?
Hello?
(GRUNTING) Who's there? Who are you?
(GASPING) (SQUEALING) (DOCTOR WHO THEME) (WHOOSHING) Where are we?
Ah! Smell that Atlantic breeze, Nice and cold. Lovely! Martha, have you met my friend?
MARTHA: Is that... Oh, my God, that's the Statue of Liberty!
Gateway to the New World.
“Give me your tired, your poor "Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." That's so brilliant. I've always wanted to go to New York.
I mean, the real New York, not the new, new, new one.
Well, there's the genuine article.
So good, they named it twice.
Mind you, it was New Amsterdam, originally.
Harder to say twice, no wonder it didn't catch on.
New Amsterdam, New Amsterdam.
Wonder what year it is?
‘Cause look, the Empire State Building's not even finished yet.
Work in progress. They've still got a couple of floors to go, and if I know my history, that makes the date somewhere around...
November 1st, 1930.
You're getting good at this.
That's nearly 80 years ago.
It's funny, ‘cause you see those old newsreels, all in black and white, like it's so far away, but here we are.
It's real. It's now.
Come on, you. Where do you want go first?
I think our detour just got longer.
“Hooverville Mystery Deepens." What's Hooverville?
Herbert Hoover, 31st President of the USA, came to power a year ago.
Up till then, New York was a boom town, the Roaring Twenties. And then...
The Wall Street Crash, yeah. When was that, 1929?
Yeah. The whole economy wiped out overnight.
Thousands of people unemployed.
All of a sudden, the huddled masses doubled in number with nowhere to go.
So they ended up here in Central Park.
What, they actually live in the park? In the middle of the city?
Ordinary people lost their jobs, couldn't pay the rent, they lost everything.
There are places like this all over America. No one's helping them.
You only come to Hooverville when there's nowhere else to go.
MAN: You thieving low life!
All morning I wait in the bread line for a single loaf...
I didn't touch it.
Somebody stole it from me...
Cut that out!
Cut it out, right now.
He stole my bread!
That's enough!
Did you take it?
I don't know what happened, he just went crazy.
That's enough!
Now, think real careful before you lie to me.
I'm starving, Solomon.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) We all starving. We all got family somewhere.
No stealing and no fighting. You know the rules.
Thirteen years ago, I fought in the Great War. A lot of us did.
And the only reason we got through because we stuck together.
No matter how bad things get, we still act like human beings.
It's all we got.
Come on.
I suppose that makes you the boss around here.
And who might you be?
He's the Doctor, I'm Martha.
A doctor?
Well, we got stockbrokers, we've got a lawyer, but you're the first doctor.
The neighbourhood gets classier by the day.
How many people live here?
Any one time, hundreds. No place else to go.
But I will say this about Hooverville, we a truly equal society.
Black, white, all the same, all starving.
So you're welcome, both of you.
But tell me, Doctor, you're a man of learning, right?
Explain this to me.
That there is going to be the tallest building in the world.
How come they can do that and we got people starving in the heart of Manhattan?
Right, a little more.
Hoist!
MAN: I'm telling you the men won't stand for it.
I mean, are you out of your mind?
I got five hundred men working seven days a week.
They're flat out, and you want us to go faster?
The new masters demand it.
But we're on schedule. What's the problem?
Another month and we'll be done.
The mast on this building needs extra work completed by tonight.
Tonight? No way. It's impossible.
That's an order.
Yeah?
Well, one word from me, and every man on this site stops work.
So go on, tell your masters that.
If that’s your attitude, I think you should tell them yourself.
Yeah? Well, I ain't afraid of no man in a suit.
These new bosses, what's their names?
I think you could say they're from out of town.
Italians?
Bit further than that.
How much further?
Beyond your imagination.
Oh, what's that supposed to mean? Who are they?
Mr Diagoras, who are we working for?
Behold your masters.
(BELL DINGING) What the hell...
I have been summoned. Explain.
Explain!
It can talk. How does it talk?
And what the hell are they? You gotta be kidding me?
I'm sorry, my lord, but this man is refusing to complete the work.
Then we must replace him.
Is anybody gonna tell me what the hell is happening here?
Use him. Take him for the final experiment.
What's going on? Let go. Let go of me.
Let go of me. Get off of me, you freaks!
Mr Diagoras, will you tell them! Mr Diagoras...
The Empire State Building must be completed in time.
It will be, trust me.
labour is cheap and that man can be replaced.
The plan must not fail We calculate the Gamma strike has accelerated.
We need more bodies immediately!
Yas, master.
So, men going missing. Is this true?
It's true all right.
But what does missing mean?
I mean, people must come and go here all the time.
It's not like anyone's keeping a register.
Come on in.
This is different.
In what way?
Someone takes them, at night.
We hear something, someone calls out for help.
By the time we get there, they're gone. Like they vanish into thin air.
And you're sure someone's taking them?
Doctor, when you've got next to nothing, you hold on to the little you got.
Knife, blanket, you take it with you.
You don't leave bread uneaten, a fire still burning.
Have you been to the police?
Yeah, we tried that. Another deadbeat goes missing, big deal.
So the question is who's taking them and what for?
Solomon! Solomon, Mr Diagoras is here.
I need men, volunteers, I've got a little work for you.
And you sure look like you could use the money.
Yeah, what is the money?
A dollar a day.
(MEN LAUGHING) What's the work?
A little trip down the sewers.
Got a tunnel collapsed, needs clearing and fixing. Any takers?
Uh-uh.
A dollar a day is a slave wage.
MEN: Yeah, yeah!
And men don't always come back up, do they?
Accidents happen.
What do you mean, what sort of accidents?
You don't need the work, that's fine.
Anybody else? Enough with the questions.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm volunteering. I'll go.
TU Kill you for this.
(CHUCKLES) DIAGORAS: Anybody else?
Turn left, go about half a mile, follow tunnel 273, the fall's right ahead of you. You can't miss it.
And when do we get our dollar?
When you come back up.
And if we don't come back up?
Then I got no one to pay.
Don't worry, we'll be back.
Let's hope so.
FRANK: We gotta stick together.
It's easy to get lost. It's like a huge rabbit warren.
You could hide an army down here.
MARTHA: So, what about you, Frank?
You're not from around these parts, are you?
(LAUGHING) Oh, you can talk.
No, I'm Tennessee, born and bred.
So how come you're here?
Oh, my Daddy died, Momma couldn't afford to feed us all, so, I'm the oldest, up to me to feed myself.
So I put on my coat, hitched up here on the railroads.
There's a whole lot of runaways in the camp, younger than me from all over, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas.
Solomon keeps a look out for us.
So, what about you? You're a long way from home.
Yeah, I'm just a hitcher, too.
You stick with me, you'll be all right.
So this Diagoras bloke, who is he, then?
Couple of months ago, he was just another foreman.
Now seems like he's running most of Manhattan.
How'd he manage that, then?
These are strange times.
A man can go from being the king of the hill to the lowest of the low overnight.
Guess for some folks, it works the other way around.
Whoa!
Is it radioactive, or something?
(GAGGING) It's gone off, whatever it is.
And you've got to pick it up.
Shine your torch through it.
Composite organic matter. Martha, medical opinion?
It's not human, I know that.
No. It's not.
And I'll tell you something else.
We must be at least half a mile in, I don't see any signs of a collapse, do you?
So why did Mr Diagoras send us down here?
Where are we now? What's up above?
Well, we're right underneath Manhattan.
DIAGORAS: And here, the crowning glory of the Empire State Building, the mast itself.
1,472 feet above New York.
It's a beautiful thing, sir.
And every single one of us is proud of it.
My wife says it's like a, like a spire reaching into heaven.
Except the gates of heaven need a little decoration.
These plates have gotta be fixed to the mast, right to the base itself.
That's okay. That's not too bad. Shouldn't take too long.
But the work has gotta be finished tonight.
What, are you trying to kill us?
It's not safe!
We're flat out up there. Come on.
Don't argue with me!
But, sir, the men can't work up there at night.
It's freezing. Your hands go numb, you lose your grip, you fall.
You don't get it.
If you won't work, I can replace you like that.
Now take those panels and get going.
What sort of metal is this, anyway?
Don't ask questions. Just go.
I don't care how cold it is, how tired you are, just get out there and finish the job!
The conductor must be complete for our plan to succeed.
Unemployment is such an incentive.
It'll get done, don't worry.
Daleks have no concept of worry.
Yeah? Well, lucky you.
This day is ending.
Humankind is weak, you shelter from the dark.
And yet, you have built all this.
That's progress.
You gotta move with the times or you get left behind.
My planet is gone.
Destroyed in a great war.
Yet, versions of this city stand throughout history.
The human race always continues.
We've had wars. I've been a soldier myself.
And I swore then I'd survive, no matter what.
You have rare ambition.
I want to run this city, whatever it takes. By any means necessary.
You think like a Dalek.
I'll take that as a compliment.
This human is our best option. Bring him to me.
Your loyalty will be rewarded. Come with me.
Prepare the laboratory. The final experiment will begin!
We obey.
Where are we going?
You have been summoned by our leader.
Oh, and about time, too.
(SNORTING) I bring you the human.
I take it you're in charge?
Correct.
Tam Dalek Sec. Leader of the Cult of Skaro.
Then, my Lord Sec, I am honoured to meet you.
Ever since you first made contact with me, transmitting your thoughts into the corners of my mind, tempting me with such images, such ideas, oh, sir, I'd always dreamt that together...
Cease talking.
I just wanna let you know how grateful I am...
I said cease!
Slaves! Secure the human.
But you don't need to do that, I'm on your side.
I'm working with you. I'm your partner! I'm your friend!
We're way beyond half a mile. There's no collapse, nothing.
That Diagoras bloke, was he lying?
Looks like it.
So why'd he want people to come down here?
Solomon, I think it's time you took these two back.
I'll be much quicker on my own.
(SQUEALING) What the hell was that?
Hello?
Shh!
SOLOMON: Frank!
What if it’s one of the folk gone missing?
You'd be scared, half mad down here on your own.
You think they're still alive?
Heck, we ain't seen no bodies down here. Maybe they just got lost.
(SQUEALING) I never heard nobody make a sound like that.
Where's it coming from?
FRANK: Sounds like there's more than one of them.
This way?
No, that way.
Doctor.
Who are you?
FRANK: Are you lost?
Can you understand me?
I've been thinking about folk lost down here.
It's all right, Frank, just stay back. Let me have a look.
He's got a point, though, my mate Frank.
I'd hate to be stuck down here on my own.
We know the way out. Daylight. If you come with us.
Oh, but what are you?
Is that some kind of carnival mask?
No, it's real.
I'm sorry.
But listen to me. I promise I can help.
Who did this to you?
Doctor, I think you'd better get back here.
Doctor!
Actually, good point.
They're following you.
Yeah, I noticed that, thanks.
Right, then, Martha, Frank, Solomon.
MARTHA: What?
I think, um, basically, run!
Where are we going?
This way!
There's a ladder. Come on!
Frank!
Come on, Frank.
Come on.
SOLOMON: I got you.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Frank!
Frank!
No!
We can't go after him. I've got to go back down!
We can't just leave him.
No, I'm not losing anybody else!
Those creatures were from hell! From hell itself!
If we go after him, they'll take us all! There's nothing we can do.
I'm sorry.
All right then, put ‘em up!
Hands in the air and no funny business.
Now, tell me, you shmucks, what have you done with Laszlo?
Who's Laszlo?
Laszlo's my boyfriend.
Was my boyfriend until he disappeared two weeks ago.
No letter, no goodbye, no nothing.
And I'm not stupid. I know some guys are just pigs, but not my Laszlo.
I mean, what kind of guy asks you to meet his mom before he vamooses?
(STAMMERING) Might... might just help if you put that down.
Huh?
Oh, sure.
(EXCLAIMS) Oh, come on, it's not real. It's just a prop.
It was either that or a spear.
What do you think happened to Laszlo?
I wish I knew. One minute he's there, the next, zip, vanished.
Listen, what was your name? Tallulah.
Tallulah.
Three "L's" and an “H".
Right. We can try and find Laszlo, but he's not the only one.
There are people disappearing every night.
And there are creatures. Such creatures...
What do you mean, creatures?
Look, listen, just trust me.
Everyone is in danger. I need to find out exactly what this is.
Because then I'll know exactly what we're fighting.
Yeuch!
How about this? I found it backstage.
Perfect.
It's the capacitors I need.
I'm just rigging up a crude, little DNA scan for this beastie.
If I can get a chromosomal reading, I can find out where it's from.
How about you, Doctor? Where are you from?
I been all over, I never heard anybody talk like you.
Just exactly who are you?
Oh, I'm just sort of passing by.
I'm not a fool, Doctor.
No. Sorry.
I was scared, Doctor.
I let ‘em take Frank ‘cause I was just so scared.
I got to get back to Hooverville.
With these creatures on the loose, we gotta protect ourselves.
And no one else gonna help us. ~Good luck.
I hope you find what you're looking for, for all our sakes, Laszlo, he'd wait for me after the show.
Walk me home, like I was a lady.
He'd leave a flower for me on my dressing table.
Every day, just a single rosebud.
Haven't you reported him missing?
Sure, but he's just a stagehand, who cares?
The management certainly don't.
Can't you kick up a fuss or something?
Okay, so then they fire me.
But they'd listen to you, you're one of the stars.
Oh, honey, I got one song in a back-street revue, and that's only "cause Heidi Chicane broke her ankle, which had nothing to do with me whatever anybody says.
I can't afford to make a fuss.
If I don't make this month's rent, then before you know it, I'm in Hooverville.
Okay, I get it.
It's the Depression, sweetie.
Your heart might break, but the show goes on, ‘cause if it stops, you starve.
Every night I have to go out there, sing, dance, keep going, hoping he's gonna come back.
I'm sorry.
Hey, you're lucky, though. You got yourself a forward-thinking guy with that hot potato in the sharp suit.
Oh, he's not... We're not together.
Oh, sure you are. I've seen the way you look at him. It's obvious.
Not to him.
Oh, I should have realised. He's into musical theatre, huh?
What a waste. Still, you gotta live in hope.
It's the only thing that's kept me going, ‘cause, well, look.
On my dressing table every day still.
Do you think it's Laszlo?
I don't know.
If he's still around, why is he being all secret, like he doesn't want me to see him?
The stories are true. People are being taken.
We lost Frank today.
He was stolen from right in front of me, but no more. I swear to you, no more!
Now, I made a pledge that this place would be a peaceful place, but now it's time to take up arms.
MEN: Yeah!
We need weapons. We need sentries on duty.
We need men prepared to fight.
We got to protect ourselves, ‘cause you know no one else will. Now get moving!
Arm yourselves, come on!
MEN: Yeah!
I can't feel my fingers.
(GRUNTING) (DRILLING) We can't stay here for much longer. We'll fall.
Come on, we're nearly done.
The chromatin solution is ready.
Then our preparations are complete.
What are you doing? Preparations for what?
This is the final experiment.
What do you mean? Do you mean like those pig-men things?
You're not gonna turn me into one of those. Oh, God, please don't!
The Pig Slaves are primitive.
The final experiment is greater by far.
But how does that involve me?
We need your flesh. Bring him to me.
Halt! This action contradicts the Dalek imperative.
Daleks are supreme. Humans are weak.
But there are millions of humans and only four of us.
If we are supreme, why are we not victorious?
The Cult of Skaro was created by the Emperor for this very purpose, to imagine new ways of survival.
But we must remain pure.
No, Dalek Thay! Our purity has brought us to extinction!
We must adapt to survive.
You have all made sacrifices.
And now I will sacrifice myself for the greater cause, for the future of Dalek-kind. Now bring me the human!
But I don't understand. What do you mean? Get off of me.
Behold the true Dalek form.
Now join with me.
No! Get off me! I did everything you asked of me! No!
That's it, just need to heat you up.
Girls, it's show time!
Lois, you spoil my sashay tonight, I'm gonna punch you.
Quit complaining, Myrna.
~Go buy yourself some glasses.
Come on, honey, take a look.
Ever been on stage before?
Oh, little bit, you know, Shakespeare.
How dull is that? Come and see a real show!
This is artificial!
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen...
They genetically engineered it.
Whoever this is, oh, you're clever.
ANNOUNCER: With Heaven and Hell.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING) (MUSIC PLAYING) # You lured me in with your cold grey eyes # Your simple smile your bewitching lies # One and one and one is three # My bad, bad angel # The devil and me # You put the devil in me # You put the devil in me # You put the devil in me # My bad, bad angel # You put the devil in me # (AUDIENCE WHISTLING) What are you doing?
(EXCLAIMS) What are you doing?
You're on my tail. Get off my tail!
Fundamental DNA type 467-989.
989. Hold on, now that means planet of origin...
Skaro.
Get off the stage, you're spoiling it.
But look, over there!
(SCREAMING) Hey!
Wait!
But you're different to the others. Just wait.
(CLANKING) It was like something out of a movie show.
Oh, that face. I ain't never gonna sleep.
Where is she? Where's Martha?
I don't know. She ran off the stage.
(GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Martha!
Oh, where are you going?
They've taken her.
Who's taken her? What are you doing?
I said what the hell are you doing?
(MUMBLING) Crazy guy...
No, no, no, no way. You're not coming.
Tell me what's going on.
There's nothing you can do, go back.
Look, whoever's taken Martha they could have taken Laszlo, couldn't they?
Tallulah, you're not safe down here.
Then that's my problem.
Come on. Which way?
This way.
Let me go!
Martha.
You're alive, Oh, I thought we'd lost you. Alright, all right, we're moving!
Where are they taking us?
I don't know.
But we can find out what's going on down here.
When you say they've taken her, who's they, exactly?
And who are you, anyway? I never asked.
“Shh.
Okay, okay.
Shh!
I mean, you're a handsome enough...
(MUFFLED SCREAM) No, no, no.
They survive. They always survive, while I lose everything.
That metal thing, what was it?
It's called a Dalek.
And it's not just metal, it's alive.
You're kidding me.
Do I look like I'm kidding?
Inside that shell there's a creature born to hate, who's only thought is to destroy everything and everyone that isn't a Dalek too.
They won't stop until it's killed every human being alive.
But if that's not a human being, that kind of implies it's from outer space.
Yet again, that’s a no with the kidding. Oy!
Well, what's it doing here in New York?
Stop the process. Dalek Sec is failing!
No! The experiment must continue.
Administer the solution!
We must evolve, Evolve! Evolve!
Every second you're down here, you're in danger. I'm taking you back right now.
(SCREAMING) Where's Martha? What have you done with her?
What have you done with Martha?
I didn't take her.
Can you remember your name?
Don't look at me.
Do you know where she is?
Stay back! Don’t look at me.
What happened to you?
They made me a monster.
Who did?
The masters, The Daleks. Why?
They needed slaves.
They needed slaves to steal more people, so they created us, part animal, part human.
l escaped before they got my mind but it was still too late.
Do you know what happened to Martha?
They took her. It's my fault, she was following me.
Were you in the theatre?
I never...
“Yes, Why? Why were you there?
I never wanted you to see me like this.
Why me? What I got to do with this?
Were you following me? Is that why you were there?
Yes.
Who are you?
I was lonely.
Who are you?
I needed to see you.
Who are you?
I'm sorry.
No, wait.
Let me look at you.
Laszlo?
My Laszlo?
What have they done to you?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Laszlo, can you show me where they are?
But they'll kill you.
If I don't stop them, they'll kill everyone.
Then follow me.
What are they keeping us here for?
I don't know.
Got a nasty feeling we're being kept in the larder.
(SNORTING) What are they doing? What's wrong? What's wrong?
Silence! Silence!
What the hell is that?
You will form a line! Move! Move!
Just do what it says, everyone, okay? Just obey.
The female is wise, Obey!
Report!
These are strong specimens.
They will help the Dalek cause.
Dalek.
What is the status of the final experiment?
The Dalekenium is in place. The energy conductor is now complete.
Then I will extract prisoners for selection.
Intelligence scan  initiate.
Reading brainwaves. Low intelligence.
You calling me stupid?
Silence!
This one will become a Pig Slave. Next.
No, let go of me! I'm not becoming one of them.
No, let me go!
Intelligence scan  initiate.
They're divided into two groups: high intelligence and low intelligence.
The low intelligence are taken to become Pig Slaves, like me.
But that's not fair! “Shh!
You're the smartest guy I ever dated.
And the others?
They're taken to the laboratory.
Why? What for?
I don't know.
The masters only call it the final experiment.
Superior intelligence.
Intelligence scan  initiate.
Superior intelligence.
This one will become part of the final experiment.
You can't just experiment on people. It's insane! It's inhuman!
We are not human.
Prisoners of high intelligence will be taken to the Transgenic Laboratory.
Look out, they're moving.
Doctor. Doctor, quickly!
I'm not coming. I've got an idea. You go.
Laszlo, come on.
Can you remember the way?
Yeah, I think so.
Then go, please.
But, Laszlo, you've got to come with me.
Where would I go?
Tallulah, I'm begging you. Just save yourself, just run. Just go!
Go.
Keep walking.
I am so glad to see you.
Yeah, well, you can kiss me later. You, too, Frank, if you want.
Report!
Dalek Sec is entering the final stage of evolution.
Scan him. Prepare for birth, Evolution?
What's wrong with old Charlie Boy over there?
DOCTOR: Ask them.
What, me? Don't be daft.
I don't exactly want to get noticed. Ask them what's going on.
Daleks, I demand to be told.
What is this final experiment?
Report!
You will bear witness, To what?
This is the dawn of a new age.
What does that mean?
We are the only four Daleks in existence.
So the species must evolve.
A life outside the shell.
The children of Skaro must walk again.
What is it?
I am a human Dalek.
Tam your future.
Move, move, move, move, move!
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Martha, have you met my friend?
MARTHA: Always wanted to go to New York.
November Its, 1930.
You only come to Hooverville when there's nowhere else to go.
Men going missing, is this true?
Laszlo?
DALEK: The Empire State Building must be completed in time.
Are you trying to kill us?
Don't argue with me!
This human is our best option.
No!
The Final Experiment will begin.
The children of Skaro must walk again.
What is it?
I am a human Dalek.
These humans will become like me.
Prepare them for hybridisation.
(PIG SLAVES SNORTING) MARTHA: Leave me alone. Don't you dare!
(HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN PLAYING) What is that sound?
Ah, well now, that would be me.
Hello. Surprise! Boo! Etcetera.
Doctor?
The enemy of the Daleks!
Exterminate!
Wait!
Well, then, a new form of Dalek.
Fascinating and very clever.
The Cult of Skaro escaped your slaughter.
How did you end up in 1930?
Emergency temporal shift.
Oh, that must've roasted up your power cells, eh?
Time was, four Daleks could've conquered the world!
But instead, you're skulking away, hidden in the dark, experimenting.
All of which results in you.
I am Dalek in human form.
But what does it feel like?
You can talk to me, Dalek Sec.
It is Dalek Sec, isn't it, that's your name?
You've got a name and a mind of your own.
Tell me what you're thinking right now.
I feel humanity.
Good, that's good.
I feel everything we wanted from mankind, which is ambition, hatred, aggression and war.
Such a genius for war...
No, that's not what humanity means.
I think it does!
At heart, this species is so very Dalek.
Alright, so what have you achieved, then, with this Final Experiment, eh? Nothing!
‘Cause I can show you what you're missing with this thing.
A simple, little radio.
What is the purpose of that device?
Well, exactly.
It plays music. What's the point of that?
Oh, with music, you can dance to it, sing with it, fall in love to it.
Unless you're a Dalek, of course. Then it's all just noise.
(SHRILL BUZZING) “Run!
Protect the hybrid!
Protect! Protect! Protect!
Report status, Pain. Pain of the flesh like no Dalek has felt for thousands of years.
The Doctor has escaped!
DALEK SEC: Then find him! Find him!
Find the Doctor. The prisoners must be recaptured.
Come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
And you, Tallulah, run!
What's happened to Laszlo?
Come on, everyone up! Come on! Come on!
They have ascended.
Return to base!
Request information. What is your opinion of Dalek Sec?
We were created to follow him.
But you have doubts?
Affirmative, SOLOMON: These Daleks, they sound like the stuff of nightmares.
And they want to breed?
They're splicing themselves on to human bodies.
And, if I'm right, they've got a farm of breeding stock, right here in Hooverville. You've got to get everyone out.
Hooverville's the lowest place a man can fall.
There's nowhere else to go.
I'm sorry, Solomon, you've got to scatter, go anywhere, get on to the railroads, travel across state, just get out of New York.
There's got to be a way to reason with these things.
There's not a chance.
You ain't seen ‘em, boss.
Daleks are bad enough at any time, but right now, they're vulnerable.
That makes them more dangerous than ever.
(SNORTING) They're coming! They're coming!
A sentry must have seen something.
They're here, I've seen them! Monsters! They're monsters!
It's started.
We're under attack! Everyone to arms!
I'm ready, boss.
But all of you, find a weapon! Use anything!
Come back! We've got to stick together. It's not safe out there, come back!
(SNORTING) WOMAN: Hurry, hurry! Come on!
We need to get out of the park.
We can't.
They're on all sides. They're driving everyone back towards us.
TALLULAH: We're trapped.
Then we stand together!
Gather round! Everybody come to me!
You there, Jethro, Harry, Seamus, stay together.
They can't take all of us!
If we can just hold them off till daylight...
Oh, Martha, they're just the foot soldiers.
Oh, my God!
What in this world...
It's the devil. A devil in the sky.
God save us all, it's damnation.
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that!
That's not gonna work.
Establish visual contact.
Commence the attack.
There's more than one of them.
(ALL SCREAMING) The humans will surrender!
Leave them alone, they've done nothing to you!
We have located the Doctor.
No, Solomon, stay back!
I'm told that I'm addressing the Daleks. Is that right?
DALEK SEC: Observe humanity.
For all their faults, they have such courage.
From what I hear, you're outcasts, too.
Solomon, don't.
Doctor, this is my township.
SOLOMON: You will respect my authority.
Just let me try.
Daleks, ain't we the same? Underneath, ain't we all kin?
‘Cause you see, I've just discovered, this past day, that God's universe is a thousand times the size I thought it was.
And that scares me. Oh, yeah, terrifies me right down to the bone.
But surely, it's got to give me hope, hope that, maybe together, we can make a better tomorrow.
So I beg you now, if you have any compassion in your hearts, then you'll meet with us and stop this fight.
Well?
What do you say?
Exterminate.
(SCREAMING) Solomon!
No! Solomon!
They killed him. They just shot him on the spot.
Daleks!
Alright. So it's my turn.
Then kill me.
Kill me, if it'll stop you attacking these people.
I will be the destroyer of our greatest enemy!
Then do it! Do it! Just do it!
Do it!
Exterminate.
Stop! I command you, stop!
I do not understand. It is the Doctor!
But I want him alive.
The urge to kill is too strong.
I have decided. The Doctor must live.
And you will obey me!
Tobey.
What's going on?
DALEK SEC: Bring him to me.
You will follow.
No. You can't go.
I've got to go. The Daleks just changed their minds, Daleks never change their minds.
But what about us?
One condition.
If I come with you, you spare the lives of everyone here.
Do you hear me?
Obey the Doctor.
Humans will be spared. Doctor, follow.
Then I'm coming with you.
Martha, stay here.
Do what you do best. People are hurt, you can help them.
Let me go.
Oh, and can I just say thank you very much.
You saved the Doctor. Why?
He's a genius and we can use him.
The future of the Daleks might well depend upon the Doctor.
MAN: Somebody help me!
Here you go, I got some more on the boil.
Thanks.
You'll be all right, it's just a cut. Try and keep it clean.
Thanks.
So what about us? What do we do now?
The Doctor gave me this.
He must've had a reason.
What's that for?
It gets you into places. Buildings and things.
But where?
He must want me to go somewhere, but what am I supposed to do?
Those people were defenceless!
You only wanted me, but no, that wasn't enough for you, you had to start killing, ‘cause that's the only thing a Dalek's good for.
The deaths were wrong.
I'm sorry?
That man, their leader, Solomon, he showed courage.
And that's good?
That's excellent.
Is it me, or are you just becoming a little bit more human?
You are the last of your kind.
And now I am the first of mine.
What do you want me for?
We tried everything to survive.
When we found ourselves stranded in this ignorant age, first we tried growing new Dalek embryos, but their flesh was too weak.
Yeah, I found one of your experiments just left to die out there in the dark.
It forced us to conclude what is the greatest resource of this planet?
Its people.
We stole them.
We stole human beings for our purpose.
Look inside.
This is the true extent of the Final Experiment.
Is he dead?
Near death.
With his mind wiped, ready to be filled with new ideas.
Dalek ideas.
The human Dalek race.
All of these people... How many?
We have caverns beyond this storing more than 1,000.
Is there any way to restore them, to make them human again?
Everything that they were has been lost.
So they're like shells.
You got empty human beings ready to be converted.
That's gonna take a hell of a lot of power.
This planet hasn't even split the atom yet.
How are you going to do it?
DALEK SEC: Open the conductor plan.
Wait a minute, Down in the sewers, the Daleks mentioned this energy conductor.
What does that mean?
I don't know. Maybe like a lightning conductor, or...
Dalekanium!
Oh!
They said the Dalekanium was in place.
In place where?
Frank might know.
Right.
Frank?
Hmm?
That Mr Diagoras, he was like some sort of fixer, yeah?
~Get you jobs all over town?
Yeah, he could find a profit anywhere.
But where, though? What sort of things?
You name it.
We're all so desperate for work, you'd just hope Diagoras would pick you something good.
Building work, that pays the best.
But what sort of building work?
Mainly building that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Empire State Building.
We're right underneath that. I worked that out already, thanks.
But what, you've hijacked the whole building?
We needed an energy conductor.
What for?
I am the genetic template.
My altered DNA was to be administered to each human body.
A strong enough blast of gamma radiation can splice the Dalek and human genetic codes and waken each body from its sleep.
Gamma radiation? What...
Oh, the sun. You're using the sun.
Soon, the greatest solar flare for 1,000 years will hit the Earth.
Gamma radiation will be drawn to the energy conductor.
And when it strikes...
The army wakes.
I still don't know what you need me for.
Your genius.
Consider a pure Dalek.
Intelligent but emotionless.
Removing the emotions makes you stronger.
That's what your creator thought all those years ago.
He was wrong.
He was what?
It makes us lesser than our enemies.
We must return to the flesh and also the heart.
You wouldn't be the supreme beings any more.
And that is good.
That is incorrect!
Daleks are supreme!
No!
Not any more.
But that is our purpose!
Then our purpose is wrong!
Where has our quest for supremacy led us?
To this. Hiding in the sewers on a primitive world.
Just four of us left.
If we do not change now, then we deserve extinction.
So you want to change everything that makes a Dalek a Dalek?
If you can help me.
I've always wanted to go to the Empire State!
I never imagined it quite like this, though.
Where are we headed, anyway?
The top, where they're still building.
Hey, how come those guys just let us through?
How does that thing work?
Psychic paper, shows them whatever I want them to think.
According to this, we're two engineers and an architect.
Your knowledge of genetic engineering is even greater than ours.
The new race must be ready by the time the solar flare erupts.
But you're the template. I thought they were getting a dose of you.
I want to change the gene sequence.
To make them even more human.
Humans are the great survivors. We need that ability.
Hold on a minute, though.
There's no way this lot are gonna let you do it.
I am their leader.
Oh, and that's enough for you, is it?
Daleks must follow orders.
Dalek Sec commands. We obey.
If you don't help me, nothing will change.
There's no room on Earth for another race of people.
You have your Tardis.
Take us across the stars.
Find us a new home and allow the new Daleks to start again.
When's that solar flare?
Eleven minutes.
Right, then!
Better get to work!
Look at this place!
Top of the world!
Okay, now this looks good.
Hey, look at the date.
These designs were issued today.
They must have changed something last minute.
MARTHA: You mean the Daleks changed something?
Yeah, could be.
The ones underneath, they're from before.
That means whatever they changed must be on this top sheet but not on this one.
We need to check one against the other.
All right.
The height of this place. This is amazing!
Careful! We're 100 floors up, don't go wandering off.
I just wanna see.
New York City.
If aliens had to come to Earth, oh, no wonder they came here.
There's no point in chromosomal grafting, it's too erratic.
We need to split the genome and force the new Dalek human sequence right into the cortex.
We need more chromatin solution.
The Pig Slaves have it These Pig Slaves, what happens to them in the grand plan?
Nothing. They're just simple beasts. Their life span is limited.
None survive beyond a few weeks.
Power up the line feeds.
Laszlo, I can't undo what they've done to you.
But they won't do it to anyone else.
Do you trust him?
I know that one man can change the course of history.
The right idea, in the right place, at the right time, that’s all it takes.
I've got to believe it's possible.
I'll go and keep an eye out, make sure we're safe up here.
Don't want nobody butting in.
There's a hell of a storm moving in.
I wish the Doctor was here. He'd know what we're looking for.
So tell me.
Where did you and him first hook up?
It was in hospital. Sort of.
‘Course, him being a doctor.
Actually, I'm the doctor.
Well, kind of.
You're a physician?
Really?
I was training. Still am, if I ever get back home.
You could be doctors together. What a partnership!
Ah, such a shame.
If only he wasn't so different, you know what I mean?
Oh, you have no idea how different he really is.
Yeah, he's a man, sweetheart. That's different enough.
He had this companion a while back, this friend.
And ever since then, he's been on his own.
But you know, sometimes, I say something, or do something, and he looks at me and I just sort of think that he's not seeing me.
He's just remembering.
Oh, listen, sweetheart, you want to get all sad, you want to have a contest with me and Laszlo?
No.
But listen, if the Doctor's with Laszlo now, there's every chance that he could get him out.
And then what?
Don't talk crazy. There's no future for me and him.
Those Dalek things took that away.
The one good thing I had in my life and they destroyed it.
The line feeds are ready.
Then it's all systems go!
The solar flare is imminent.
The radiation will reach Earth in a matter of minutes.
And we'll be ready for it.
That compound will allow the gene bonds to reconfigure in a brand new pattern.
Power up!
Start the line feeds, There goes the gene solution. The life blood.
Gotcha! Look!
There, on the mast, those little lines, they're new.
They've added something, see?
Added what?
Dalekanium!
Dalekanium!
(ALARM BLARING) What's that?
What's happening? Is there a malfunction?
Answer me!
No, no, no. The gene feed!
They're overriding the gene feed.
Impossible!
They cannot disobey orders.
The Doctor will step away from the controls.
Stop! You will not fire!
He is an enemy of the Daleks.
And so are you.
I am your commander. I am Dalek Sec!
You have lost your authority.
You are no longer a Dalek.
What have you done? What's going into the gene feed?
The new bodies will be 100% Dalek.
No! You can't do this!
Pig Slaves, restrain Dalek Sec and the Doctor.
DALEK SEC: Release me!
I created you! I am your master!
DALEK: Solar flare approaching!
Prepare to intercept!
There's the lift.
After you.
DALEK: The Doctor is escaping. Stop him! Stop him!
We've only got minutes before the gamma radiation reaches the earth.
We need to get to the top of the building.
Laszlo, what's wrong?
Out of breath. It's nothing.
We escaped them, Doctor, that's all that matters.
You have betrayed me.
You told us to imagine.
And we imagined your irrelevance.
I was your leader! I am Dalek Sec!
Obey me!
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Doctor!
First floor, perfumery.
I never thought I'd see you again!
No stopping me.
We've worked it out. We know what they've done.
There's Dalekanium on the mast and it's good to see you, too, by the way.
Oh, come here!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
See, never waste time with a hug!
Deadlock seal, I can't stop it.
Where's it going?
Back down to the Daleks and they aren't gonna leave us alone up here.
What's the time?
11:15.
Six minutes to go! I've got to remove the Dalekanium before the gamma radiation hits.
Gammon radiation? What the heck is that?
Oh, that's high.
That's very... Blimey, that's high.
And we've got to go even higher.
That's the mast, up there, look.
There's three pieces of Dalekanium on the base. We've got to get ‘em off.
That's not we, that's just me.
I'm not gonna just stand here and watch you.
No, you're gonna have your hands full anyway.
I'm sorry, Martha, but you've got to fight.
Confirm time until solar intercept.
Gamma strike, four minutes and counting!
(BUZZING) Pig Slaves will take the lift! Find the Doctor! Kill him!
(PIG SLAVES SNORTING) The lift's coming up.
I should have brought that gun.
Tallulah, stay back. You, too, Martha.
If they send Pig Slaves, they're trained to kill.
The Doctor needs me to fight, I'm not going anywhere.
But they're savages. I should know.
They're trained to slit your throat with their bare teeth, Laszlo, what is it?
No, it's nothing, I'm fine. Just leave me.
Oh, honey, you're burning up.
What's wrong with you? Tell me!
One man down, we ain't even started yet.
It's not looking good, Frank. “No.
We're gonna get slaughtered.
Wait a minute, Lightning!
You'll be all right, sweetheart. Don't you worry.
What the hell are you two clowns doing?
Even if the Doctor stops the Dalekanium, this place is still gonna get hit.
Great big bolt of lightning! Electricity all down the building!
Connect this to the lift, and they get zapped!
Oh, my God, that could work!
Then give us a hand!
Gamma strike imminent. In 40 rels, 39, 38, 57...
TALLULAH: Is that gonna work?
It's got to!
I got it all piped up to the scaffolding outside.
Come here, Frank, just sit in the middle.
Don't touch anything metal!
FRANK: Okay.
(SCREAMING) I can't!
12, 11, 10...
Zero! Gamma strike!
(SCREAMING) The army awakes.
You did it, Martha.
They used to be like Laszlo. They were people.
And I killed them.
No. The Daleks killed them.
Long ago.
What about the Doctor?
You will identify.
Tam a Dalek.
Excellent!
Begin the invasion of Manhattan.
The population will be converted into Daleks.
And from this island, we will conquer the world!
Assume battle positions! Take arms!
Doctor!
Doctor?
Look what we found.
Halfway down.
You're getting careless.
Oh, my head!
Hiya.
Hi.
You survived, then.
So did you.
Just about.
I can't help noticing there's Dalekanium still attached.
War demands strategy. I am designated Controller!
That was to be my position.
You are unfit!
Connect me to the military computer. I will coordinate all units.
DOCTOR: The Daleks will have gone straight to a war footing.
They'll be using the sewer system.
Spreading the soldiers out underneath Manhattan.
How do we stop them?
There's only one chance.
I got in the way.
That gamma strike went zapping through me first.
Yeah, but what does that mean?
We need to draw fire.
Before they can attack New York, I need to face them.
Where can I draw them out?
Think, think, think, think, think.
I need some sort of space, somewhere safe, somewhere out of the way.
Tallulah! That's me, three L's and an H!
The theatre! It's right above them!
And what, it's gone midnight. Can you get us inside?
Don't see why not.
Is there another lift?
We came up in the service elevator.
That'll do! Allons-y!
DALEK: Report status!
Maximum efficiency! Tam now ready for full-scale war!
Control over Dalek humans?
Connection confirmed!
All soldiers will take heed!
Weapons will be primed!
This should do it. Here we go.
There ain't nothing more creepy than a theatre in the dark.
Listen, Doctor, I know you've got a thing for show tunes, but there's a time and a place, huh?
Laszlo? What's wrong?
Nothing. It's just so hot.
But it's freezing in here.
Doctor, what's happening to him?
Not now, Tallulah, sorry.
What are you doing?
If the Daleks are going to war, they'll want to find their number one enemy.
I'm just telling them where I am.
Sonic device detected!
The Doctor survived!
Find him and exterminate!
I'm telling you to go. Frank can take you back to Hooverville.
And I'm telling you, I'm not going.
Martha! That's an order!
Who are you then, some sort of Dalek?
(CRASHING) Doctor! Oh, my God!
Well, I guess that's them, then, huh?
Humans with Dalek DNA?
It's all right. Alright, just stay calm.
Don't antagonise them.
But what of the Dalek masters?
Where are they?
Doctor located! Advance! Advance!
(SCREAMING) DALEK: The Doctor will stand before the Daleks.
You will die, Doctor. It's the beginning of a new age.
Planet Earth will become new Skaro!
Oh, and what a world.
With anything just the slightest bit different ground into the dirt.
That's Dalek Sec! Don't you remember?
The cleverest Dalek ever and look what you've done to him.
Is that your new empire? Hmm?
Is that the foundation for a whole new civilisation?
My Daleks, just understand this.
If you choose death and destruction, then death and destruction will choose you.
Incorrect! We always survive.
Now we will destroy our greatest enemy, the Doctor.
DALEK SEC: But he can help you.
The Doctor must die!
No, I beg you, don't...
Exterminate!
(SCREAMING) Your own leader.
The only creature who might have led you out of the darkness, and you destroyed him.
Did you see what they did? Huh?
Do you see what a Dalek really is?
Warning! Dalek humans show increased levels of serotonin!
If I'm gonna die, let's give the new boys a shot, what do you think, eh?
The Dalek humans. Their first blood.
Go on! Baptise them!
Dalek humans, take aim.
What are you waiting for? Give the command!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Obey! Dalek humans will obey!
They're not firing.
What have you done?
You will obey!
Exterminate!
Why?
Daleks do not question orders!
But why?
You will stop this!
But why?
You must not question!
But you are not our master. And we... We are not Daleks.
DOCTOR: No, you're not.
And you never will be.
Sorry.
I got in the way of the lightning strike.
Time Lord DNA got all mixed up.
Just that little bit of freedom.
If they will not obey, then they must die.
(SCREAMING) Get down!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Destroy the hybrids! Destroy and exterminate!
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. You did it.
You're free, The Dalek humans are failures! Destruct! Destruct! Destruct!
(BUZZING) No!
They can't, they can't, they can't!
What happened? What was that?
They killed them, rather than let them live.
An entire species.
Genocide.
Only two of the Daleks have been destroyed.
One of the Dalek masters must still be alive.
Oh, yes.
In the whole universe, just one.
Now what?
You will be exterminated!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just think about it, Dalek what-was-your-name?
Dalek Caan.
Dalek Caan.
Your entire species has been wiped out and now the Cult of Skaro has been eradicated, leaving only you.
Right now, you're facing the only man in the universe who might show you some compassion.
‘Cause I've just seen one genocide.
I won't cause another.
Caan, let me help you.
What do you say?
Emergency temporal shift!
(EXCLAIMS) Doctor! Doctor!
He's sick.
(WHEEZING) It's okay. You're all right.
(LASZLO GRUNTING) It's his heart. It's racing like mad. I've never seen anything like it.
TALLULAH: What is it, Doctor?
What's the matter with him?
He says he can't breathe. What is it?
It's time, sweetheart.
What do you mean, "time"? What are you talking about?
None of the slaves survive for long. Most of them only live for a few weeks.
I was lucky.
I held on ‘cause I had you.
But now...
I'm dying, Tallulah.
No, you're not. Not now, after all this.
Doctor, can't you do something?
Oh, Tallulah, with three L's and an H, just you watch me. What do I need?
Oh, I don't know, how about a great, big genetic laboratory?
Oh, look! I've got one!
Laszlo, just you hold on!
There's been too many deaths today. Way too many people have died.
Brand-new creatures and wise old men and age-old enemies.
And I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, I am not having one more death! You got that? Not one!
Tallulah, out of the way.
The Doctor is in!
Well, I talked to them and I told them what Solomon would've said, and I reckon I shamed one or two of them.
What did they say?
They said yes.
They'll give you a home, Laszlo.
I mean, don't imagine people ain't gonna stare.
I can't promise you'll be at peace.
But, in the end, that is what Hooverville is for.
People who ain't got nowhere else.
Thank you.
LI can't thank you enough.
MARTHA: Do you reckon it's gonna work?
Those two?
I don't know.
Anywhere else in the universe, I might worry about them.
But New York? That's what this city's good at.
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses and maybe the odd Pig Slave-Dalek mutant hybrid, too.
The pig and the showgirl!
The pig and the showgirl.
Just proves it, I suppose. There's someone for everyone.
Maybe.
I meant to say, I'm sorry.
What for?
Just ‘cause that Dalek got away. I know what that means to you.
Mmm.
Do you think you'll ever see it again?
Oh, yes.
One day.
Tonight, I'm going to perform a miracle.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
There we go. Perfect landing.
Which isn't easy in such a tight spot.
You should be used to tight spots by now.
Where are we?
The end of the line.
No place like it.
Home?
You took me home?
Back to the morning after we left.
So you've only been gone about 12 hours. No time at all, really.
But all the stuff we've done, Shakespeare, New New York, old New York.
Yep. All in one night.
Relatively speaking, everything should be just as it was.
Books, CDs, laundry.
So, back where you were, as promised.
This is it?
Yeah, I should probably...
(PHONE RINGING) MARTHA: Hi, I'm out. Leave a message.
I'm sorry.
WOMAN: Martha, are you there? Pick it up, will you?
It's Mum. It'll wait.
All right, then. Pretend that you're out if you like.
I was only calling to say that your sister's on TV.
On the news of all things. Just thought you might be interested.
The details are top secret...
How could Tish end up on the news?
.. but I can tell you that tonight, I will demonstrate a device which will...
She got a new job doing PR for some research lab.
With the push of a single button, I will change what it means to be human.
REPORTER: Professor! Professor!
Sorry. You were saying you should...
Yes, yes. I should.
One trip we said.
Yeah.
I suppose things just kind of escalated.
Mmm. Seems to happen to me a lot.
Thank you. For everything.
It was my pleasure.
(WHOOSHING) (WHOOSHING) No, I'm sorry. Did he say he was going to change what it means to be human?
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Are you sure it's safe?
There were some issues. They've been resolved.
I'm confident I'm in no serious danger.
That's comforting, Richard, but it wasn't just you I was worried about.
Your concern is touching.
The people in that room will represent billions of pounds worth of potential investment.
Mr Saxon wants to be sure they like what they see.
Don't worry. Our friend will get his money's worth.
You wanted to see the guest list for tonight, Professor?
Yes, thank you, Letitia.
(SNIFFING) That's an interesting perfume. What's it called?
Soap.
Oh, black tie.
Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens.
It's not the outfit, that's just you.
Anyway, I think it suits you in a James Bond kind of way.
James Bond? Really?
Oh, look, they've got nibbles! I love nibbles, Hello! Tish!
You look great.
So, what do you think? Impressive, isn't it?
Very.
And two nights out in a row for you.
That's dangerously close to a social life.
If I keep this up, I'll end up in all the gossip columns.
You might, actually. You should keep an eye out for photographers. And Mum.
She's coming, too. Even dragging Leo along with her.
Leo? In black tie? That I must see.
This is the Doctor. “Hello, Is he with you?
Yeah.
But he's not on the list. How did he get in?
He's my plus one.
So this Lazarus, he's your boss?
Professor Lazarus, yes. I'm part of his executive staff.
She's in the PR department.
I'm head of the PR department, actually.
You're joking!
I put this whole thing together.
So do you know what the Professor's going to be doing tonight?
That looks like it might be a sonic micro-field manipulator.
He's a science geek. I should've known.
Got to get back to work now. I'll catch up with you later.
Science geek? What's that mean?
That you're obsessively enthusiastic about it.
Oh. Nice.
Your father's caused me enough heartache already with his menopause and his trophy girlfriend.
Yeah, Mum, I know.
It was just something he said last night.
Martha.
Mum.
Oh.
Alright, what's the occasion?
What do you mean? I'm just pleased to see you, that's all.
But you saw me last night.
I know, I just missed you.
You're looking good, Leo.
Yeah, if anyone asks me to fetch them a drink, I'll swing for them.
You disappeared last night. I.
.. just went home.
On your own?
This is a friend of mine, the Doctor.
Doctor what?
No, it's just the Doctor.
We've been doing some work together.
All right.
Lovely to meet you, Mrs Jones. Heard a lot about you.
Have you? What've you heard, then?
Well, you know, that you're Martha's mother and...
Um...
No, actually, that's about it. We haven't had much time to chat.
You know, been busy.
Busy? Doing what exactly?
Oh. You know. Stuff.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Professor Richard Lazarus, and tonight I'm going to perform a miracle.
It is, I believe, the most important advance since Rutherford split the atom.
The biggest leap since Armstrong stood on the moon.
Tonight you will watch and wonder.
But tomorrow, you will wake to a world which will be changed forever.
(DEVICE SCREECHING) (ALARM BLARING) Something's wrong. It's overloading.
Somebody stop him! Get him away from those controls!
If this goes up, it'll take the whole building with it! Is that what you want?
DOCTOR: Get it open.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Tam Richard Lazarus.
I am 76 years old and I am reborn!
He did it. He actually did it!
That can't be the same guy. It's impossible. It must be a trick.
Oh, it's not a trick. I wish it were.
What just happened, then?
He just changed what it means to be human.
Excuse me.
That was the most astonishing thing I've ever seen.
Look at you!
This is only the beginning.
We're not just making history, we're shaping the future, too.
Think of the money we'll make.
People will sell their souls to be transformed like that.
And I'll be first in line.
Richard!
I'm famished.
Energy deficit. Always happens with this kind of process.
You talk as if you see this every day, Mr...?
Doctor. And, well, no, not every day, but I have some experience with this kind of transformation.
That's not possible.
Using hypersonic sound waves to create a state of resonance, that's inspired.
You understand the theory, then?
Enough to know that you couldn't possibly have allowed for all the variables.
No experiment is entirely without risk.
That thing nearly exploded.
You might as well have stepped into a blender.
You're not qualified to comment.
If I hadn't stopped it, it would've exploded.
Then I thank you, Doctor. But that's a simple engineering issue.
What happened inside the capsule was exactly what was supposed to happen.
No more, no less.
You've no way of knowing that until you've run proper tests.
Look at me! You can see what happened. I'm all the proof you need.
The device will be properly certified before we start to operate commercially.
Commercially? You are joking? That'll cause chaos.
Not chaos, change.
A chance for humanity to evolve, to improve.
This isn't about improving, this is about you and your customers living a little longer.
Not a little longer, Doctor, a lot longer.
Perhaps indefinitely.
Richard, we have things to discuss. Upstairs.
Goodbye, Doctor.
In a few years, you'll look back and laugh at how wrong you were.
Oh, he's out of his depth.
He's no idea the damage he might've done.
So what do we do now?
Now...
Well, this building must be full of laboratories. I say we do our own tests.
Lucky I've just collected a DNA sample then, isn’t it?
Oh, Martha Jones, you're a star!
I grew up over there. Tiny flat above a butcher's shop.
It'll have a blue plaque soon.
~"Richard Lazarus lived here." It's gone.
Destroyed in the war. The bombing.
Of course.
1940. Do you remember?
Night after night. Explosions.
Guns. Firestorms.
My parents had sent me to the country by then.
When the sirens went, we'd go to the cathedral there.
We used to shelter in the crypt.
The living cowering among the dead.
But look what you've built here now.
You've laid the foundations for an empire.
An empire we can rule together.
What's wrong?
Look at yourself, woman.
Amazing.
What?
Lazarus' DNA.
I can't see anything different.
Look at it.
Oh, my God!
Did that just change?
But it can't have.
But it did.
It's impossible.
And that's two impossible things we've seen so far tonight.
Don't you love it when that happens?
That means Lazarus has changed his own molecular patterns.
Hypersonic sound waves to destabilise the cell structure.
Then a metagenic program to manipulate the coding in the protein strands.
Basically, he hacked into his own genes and instructed them to rejuvenate.
But they're still mutating now.
Because he missed something.
Something in his DNA that's been activated and won't let him stabilise.
Something that's trying to change him.
Change him into what?
I don't know.
But I think we need to find out.
That woman said they were going upstairs.
Let's go.
It's me who made all this possible.
This is my triumph and I will not be denied.
Not by you. Not after everything I've done.
(SCOFFS) You backed me because you saw profit. Your concern was financial.
You want the money as much as I do.
We had a plan.
When the device is ready, I'll be rejuvenated, too.
We could be rich and young and together.
You think I'd waste another lifetime on you?
Did that process make you even more cruel?
No, my love, that I learned from you. You have a gift for it.
Then you'll know that I'll protect my involvement in the project.
I'm sure Mr Saxon will be interested...
What's going on?
It must just be...
What is it?
I'll be fine in a moment. It's probably just cramp.
Richard?
Is it some kind of seizure?
What should I do? I don't understand. What's happening?
Richard?
(GROWLING) Tish, have you seen Martha and that Doctor anywhere?
Not since the demonstration.
Do you know anything about him? Has she ever mentioned him before?
Not to me.
The way she followed him...
She's a doctor. She was just doing her job.
She's not a doctor yet. Never will be if she doesn't stay focused.
Look, she’s found a bloke. So what?
There's something's going on, Leo. I can feel it.
Letitia Jones. I'd recognise the smell of that soap anywhere.
Professor.
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen. You'll have to excuse me while I take care of Letitia here. I've been neglecting her.
This is his office all right. ~So where is he?
Don't know. Let's try back at the... reception.
Is that Lady Thaw?
Used to be.
It's just a shell, had all the life-energy drained out of her.
Like squeezing the juice out of an orange.
Lazarus!
Could be.
~So he's changed already.
Not necessarily.
You saw the DNA, it was fluctuating. The process must demand energy.
This might not have been enough.
So he might do this again?
Mmm.
(TISH LAUGHING) You seem very young to have such a responsible position.
Have you much experience?
Not really.
But the interview panel thought I had all the necessary attributes.
How perceptive of them.
So, where are you taking me?
Up to the roof. It's a lovely evening. I thought I'd show you the view.
It's extraordinary.
Like a lot of things round here, then.
I can't see him.
He can't be far. Keep looking.
You all right, Marth? I think Mum wants to talk to you.
Have you seen Lazarus anywhere?
He was getting cosy with Tish a couple of minutes ago.
With Tish?
Ah, Doctor.
Where did they go? Upstairs, I think. Why?
Doctor... I'm speaking to you!
Not now, Mum!
I think you need one of these.
Thank you. That's very kind of you.
Do you know that man?
No. He's a friend of my daughter's.
Perhaps she should choose her friends more carefully.
Where are they?
The fluctuating DNA will give off an energy signature.
I might be able to pick it up.
Got him.
Where?
But this is the top floor. The roof!
That clock tower is beautiful all lit up like that.
It's Southwark Cathedral. One of the oldest churches in London.
Been around even longer than I have.
But you're looking pretty good for your age.
Thank you.
Can I?
Of course.
I still can't take it in. I'm still adjusting myself.
I've been working toward it for so many years, it's hard to believe the moment's finally arrived.
And is it like you expected?
I find that nothing's ever exactly like you expect.
There's always something to surprise you.
Between the idea and the reality, between the motion and the act...
Falls the shadow.
So, the mysterious Doctor knows his Eliot.
I'm impressed.
Martha, what are you doing here? Tish, get away from him.
What? Don't tell me what to do.
I wouldn't have thought you had time for poetry, Lazarus.
What with you being so busy defying the laws of nature and everything.
You're right, Doctor.
One lifetime's been too short for me to do everything Id like.
How much more I'll get done in two or three or four.
It doesn't work like that.
Some people live more in 20 years than others do in 80.
It's not the time that matters, it's the person.
But if it's the right person, what a gift that would be.
Or what a curse.
Look at what you've done to yourself.
Who are you to judge me?
Over here, Tish.
You have to spoil everything, don't you?
Every time I find someone nice, you have to try and find fault.
Tish, he's a monster!
I know the age thing's a bit freaky, but it works for Catherine Zeta-Jones.
(LAZARUS GASPING) (FLESH TEARING) What is that?
DOCTOR: Run!
(LAZARUS GROWLING) Are you okay?
I was gonna snog him!
WOMAN ON PA: Security One.
(ALARM BLARING) Security One. Security One.
What's happening?
An intrusion.
It triggers a security lockdown. Kills most of the power.
Stops the lifts, seals the exits.
He must be breaking through that door.
The stairs. Come on!
(DOOR BREAKING) He's inside!
We haven't got much time!
Tish, is there another way out of here?
There's an exit in the corner, but it'll be locked now.
Martha, setting 54. Hurry.
Listen to me! You people are in serious danger.
You need to get out of here right now!
Don't be ridiculous. The biggest danger here is choking on an olive.
(GLASS SHATTERING) (ROARING) LEO: Mum, get back!
Leo!
Over here. This way! Everyone down the stairs now. Hurry!
No! Get away from her!
Leo? Leo?
Lazarus! Leave them alone, Martha.
Come on, stay with me.
What's the point? You can’t control it. The mutation's too strong.
Killing those people won't help you. You're a fool.
A vain old man who thought he could defy nature.
Only nature got her own back, didn't she?
You're a joke, Lazarus!
A footnote in the history of failure!
(ROARING) What's the Doctor doing?
He's trying to buy us some time.
Let's not waste it. Leo, look at me. Focus on me. Let's see your eyes.
Okay, he's got concussion. Mum, you'll need to help him downstairs.
This'll keep the swelling down. Go, I'll be right behind you.
Tish, move. We need to get out of here.
LAZARUS: It's no good, Doctor. You can't stop me.
Is that the same arrogance you had when you swore that nothing had gone wrong with your device?
The arrogance is yours. You can't stand in the way of progress.
You call feeding on innocent people progress?
You're delusional!
It is a necessary sacrifice.
That's not your decision to make.
TISH: We can't get out! We're trapped!
There must be an override switch. Where's the security desk? Tish!
There.
(DOOR OPENING) LAZARUS: Peek-a-boo.
Oh. Hello.
I've got to go back.
You can't.
You saw what that thing did. It kill you.
I don't care. I have to go.
It's that Doctor, isn't it?
That's what's happened to you. That's why you've changed.
He was biding us time, Martha.
Time for you to get out, too.
I'm not leaving him.
Martha!
(BANGING) (DOOR BREAKING) (GLASS SHATTERING) More hide and seek, Doctor? How disappointing.
Why don't you come out and face me?
Have you looked in the mirror lately?
Why would I want to face that, hmm?
What are you doing here?
I'm returning this.
I thought you might need it.
How did you...
I heard the explosion. I guessed it was you.
I blasted Lazarus.
Did you kill him?
More sort of annoyed him, I'd say.
She'll be all right.
The Doctor and her, they'll look out for each other.
She turned her back on us, went in there with that thing.
For him.
He must be some guy.
Maybe she loves him.
She just met him.
Is your daughter still in there with the Doctor?
Do you know him?
He's dangerous.
There are things you should know.
What things?
(WHISPERING) What now? We've just gone round in a circle.
We can't lead him outside. Come on, get in.
Are we hiding?
No, he knows we're here.
But this is his masterpiece.
I'm betting he won't destroy it, not even to get at us.
But we're trapped.
Well, yeah, that is a slight problem.
You mean you don't have a plan?
Yes, The plan was to get inside here.
Then what?
Well, then I'd come up with another plan.
In your own time, then.
Hey! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Here we are.
What are you going to do with that?
Improvise.
I still don't understand where that thing came from. Is it alien?
No. For once, it’s strictly human in origin.
Human? How can it be human?
Probably from dormant genes in Lazarus' DNA.
The energy field in this thing must've reactivated them.
Looks like they're becoming dominant.
So it's a throwback.
Some option that evolution rejected for you millions of years ago.
But the potential is still there, locked away in your genes, forgotten about until Lazarus unlocked it by mistake.
It's like Pandora's box.
Exactly. Nice shoes, by the way.
Doctor, what's happening?
Sounds like he's switched the machine on.
That's not good, is it?
I was hoping it was going to take him a little bit longer to work that out.
I don't want to hurry you, but...
I know. Nearly done.
What are you doing?
Trying to set the capsule to reflect energy rather than receive it.
Will that kill him?
When he transforms, he's three times the size, cellular triplication, so he's spreading himself thin.
We're going to end up like him!
Just one more.
I thought we were going to go through the blender then.
It really shouldn't take that long just to reverse the polarity.
I must be a bit out of practice.
Oh, God. He seems so human again.
It's kind of pitiful.
Eliot saw that, too.
This is the way the world ends.
Not with a bang but a whimper.
She's here. Oh, she’s all right.
Oh, Mrs Jones. We still haven't finished our chat.
Keep away from my daughter.
Mum, what are you doing?
Always the mothers. Every time.
He is dangerous. I've been told things.
What are you talking about?
Look around you. Nothing but death and destruction.
This isn't his fault. He saved us. All of us.
It was Tish who invited everyone to this thing in the first place so I'd say, technically, it's her fault.
(CRASHING) Leave him.
Martha?
Not you, too.
Sorry.
Lazarus, back from the dead. Should've known really.
Where's he gone?
That way. The church.
Cathedral.
It's Southwark Cathedral. He told me.
Do you think he's in here?
Where would you go if you were looking for sanctuary?
I came here before.
A lifetime ago.
I thought I was going to die then. In fact, I was sure of it.
I sat here, just a child.
The sound of planes and bombs outside.
The Blitz.
You've read about it.
I was there.
You're too young.
So are you.
In the morning the fires had died, but I was still alive, I swore I'd never face death like that again.
So defenceless, I would arm myself. Fight back. Defeat it.
That's what you were trying to do today?
That's what I did today.
What about the other people who died?
They were nothing.
I changed the course of history.
Any of them might've done, too.
You think history's only made with equations?
Facing death is part of being human. You can't change that.
No, Doctor, Avoiding death, that's being human.
It's our strongest impulse, to cling to life with every fibre of being.
I'm only doing what everyone before me has tried to do.
I've simply been more successful.
Look at yourself. You're mutating.
You've no control over it. You call that a success?
I call it progress.
I'm more now than I was.
More than just an ordinary human.
There's no such thing as an ordinary human.
He's going to change again any minute.
I know.
If I could get him up into the bell tower somehow, I've an idea that might work.
Up there?
You're so sentimental, Doctor. Maybe you are older than you look.
I'm old enough to know that a longer life isn't always a better one.
In the end, you just get tired.
Tired of the struggle.
Tired of losing everyone that matters to you.
Tired of watching everything turn to dust.
If you live long enough, Lazarus, the only certainty left is that you'll end up alone.
That's a price worth paying.
Is it?
I will feed soon.
I'm not going to let that happen.
You've not been able to stop me so far.
Leave him, Lazarus.
He's old and bitter.
I thought you had a taste for fresher meat.
Martha, no.
What are you doing?
Keeping you out of trouble.
Doctor, the tower!
Did you hear that?
He's changed again. Keep moving. We've got to lead him up.
(LAZARUS GROWLING) Where are they?
Martha?
Doctor!
Take him to the top, the very top of the bell tower, do you hear me?
Up to the top?
Martha?
And then what?
Martha, come on!
Hypersonic sound waves, inspired.
There's nowhere else to go. We're trapped!
This is where he said to bring him.
Right, so we're not trapped, we're bait.
He knows what he's doing. We have to trust him.
Ladies.
Stay behind me.
If he takes me, make a run for it. Head back down the stairs.
You should have enough time.
But...
Just do it, Tish!
(MARTHA AND TISH SCREAM) I hope there's a good acoustic in here.
Martha!
(SCREAMING) Hold on!
Get away from her!
We need to turn this up to 11.
I've got you! Hold on.
Martha!
I'm okay. We're both okay!
Thanks.
It's your Doctor you should be thanking.
I told you he'd think of something.
He cut it a bit fine though, didn’t he?
He always does. It's more fun that way.
Who is he?
He's...
He's the Doctor.
I didn't know you could play.
Well, you know, if you hang around with Beethoven, you're bound to pick a few things up.
Mmm.
Especially about playing loud.
Sorry?
Something else that just kind of escalated, then.
I can see a pattern developing.
You should take more care in the future. And the past.
And whatever other time period you find yourself in.
It's been fun, though, hasn't it?
Yes!
So what do you say? One more trip?
No.
Sorry.
What do you mean? I thought you liked it.
I do, but I can't go on like this. “One more trip.” It's not fair.
What are you talking about?
I don't want to be a passenger any more, someone that you take along for a treat.
That's how you still see me. I'd rather stay here.
Okay, then, if that's what you want.
Right. Well, we've already said goodbye once today.
It's probably best if you just go.
What is it?
Well, I said okay.
Sorry? ~Okay.
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Well, you were never really just a passenger, were you?
(PHONE RINGING) Hi, I'm out. Leave a message.
Martha, it’s your mother. Please phone me back.
I'm begging you. I know who this Doctor really is.
I know he's dangerous. You're going to get yourself killed.
Please trust me. This information comes from Harold Saxon himself.
You're not safe, Distress signal. Locking on.
Now that is hot. If you can't stand the heat...
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Well, there we go, universal roaming.
Never have to worry about a signal again.
No way. This is too mad.
You're telling me I can phone anyone anywhere in space and time on my mobile?
As long as you know the area code. Frequent flyers’ privilege.
Go on, try it.
(ALARM BLARING) Distress signal. Clocking off. Might be a bit of...
turbulence. Sorry. Come on, Martha, let's take a look.
COMPUTER: Automated distress signal transmitted.
Now, that is hot.
COMPUTER: Automated distress signal transmitted.
It's like a sauna in here, Venting systems working at full pelt, trying to cool down wherever it is we are. Well, if you can’t stand the heat...
“That's better.
SCANNELL: Oi, you two!
Get out of there!
Seal that door now!
Who are you? What are you doing on my ship?
Are you police?
Why would we be police?
We got your distress signal.
If this is a ship, why can't I hear any engines?
It went dead four minutes ago.
So maybe we should stop chatting and get to Engineering, Captain.
(ALARM BLARING) COMPUTER: Secure closure active, What?
The ship's gone mad.
Who activated secure closure? I nearly got locked into area 27.
Who are you?
He's the Doctor and I'm Martha. Hello.
COMPUTER: Impact projection, 42 minutes, 27 seconds.
We'll get out of this, I promise.
Doctor.
Forty two minutes until what?
Doctor!
Look!
KATH: Forty two minutes until we crash into the sun.
How many crew members on board?
Seven, including us.
We transfer cargo across the galaxy. Everything's automated.
We just keep the ship...
Call the others. I'll get you out!
What's he doing?
Doctor, don't!
But my ship's in there!
In the vent chamber?
It's our lifeboat.
It's lava.
Temperature's going mad in there. Up 3,000 degrees in 10 seconds and still rising.
Channelling the air.
The closer we get to the sun, the hotter that room's gonna get.
We're stuck here.
So we fix the engines.
We steer the ship away from the sun. Simple. Engineering down here, is it?
Yes, ~COMPUTER: Impact in 40:26.
Blimey. Do you always leave things in such a mess?
Oh, my God.
The hell happened?
Oh, it's wrecked.
Pretty efficiently, too. Someone knew what they were doing.
Where's Korwin? Has anyone heard from him or Ashton?
No.
MARTHA: Do you mean someone did this on purpose?
Korwin, Ashton, where are you?
Korwin, can you answer?
Where the hell is he? He should be up here.
Oh, we're in the Toragy system. Lovely.
You're a long way from home, Martha, half a universe away.
Yeah, feels it.
And you're still using energy scoops for fusion. Hasn't that been outlawed yet?
We're due to upgrade next docking. Scan all engine reports.
(BEEPING) No response.
What?
They're burnt out. The controls are wrecked.
I can't get them back online.
Oh, come on, auxiliary engines. Every craft's got auxiliaries.
KATH: We don't have access from here.
The auxiliary controls are in the front of the ship.
There are 29 password-sealed doors between us and them.
You'll never get there on time.
Can't you override the doors?
No, sealed closure means what it says. They're all deadlock sealed.
So a sonic screwdriver's no use, Nothing's any use. We've got no engines, no time and no chance.
Oh, listen to you! Defeated before you even started.
Where's your Dunkirk spirit? Who's got the door passwords?
They're randomly generated. Reckon I'd know most of them.
Sorry. Riley Vashtee.
Then what are you waiting for, Riley Vashtee? Get on it.
Well, it's a two-person job.
One to take this for the questions.
The other to carry this.
The oldest and cheapest security system around, eh, Captain?
Reliable and simple. Just like you, eh, Riley?
Try to be helpful, get abuse. Nice. Tl help you. Make myself useful.
It's remotely controlled by the computer panel.
That's why it needs two.
Oi, be careful.
You, too.
(OVER PA) McDonnell, it's Ashton.
Where are you? Is Korwin with you?
Get up to the med centre now.
COMPUTER: Impact in 34:31.
I've got to stop it!
Korwin, it's Abi.
Open your eyes. I need to take a look at you.
Korwin! What's happened? Is he okay?
Help! Help me! It's burning me!
How long's he been like this?
Ashton just brought him in.
What are you doing to him?
Don't get too close.
Don't be stupid. He's my husband.
And he's just sabotaged our ship.
What?
He went mad.
He put the ship under secure closure.
Then he sent a heat pulse to melt the control.
No way! He wouldn't do that.
I saw it happen, Captain.
Korwin? Korwin, open your eyes for me a second.
I can't.
Yeah, of course you can. Go on.
Don't make me look at you. Please.
Alright, all right, all right, just relax. Sedative.
What's wrong with him?
Rising body temperature, unusual energy readings.
Stasis chamber. I do love a good stasis chamber.
Keep him sedated in there. Regulate the body temperature.
And just for fun, run a bio-scan, a tissue profile and a metabolic detail.
Just doing them now.
Oh, you're good. Anyone else presenting these symptoms?
Not so far.
Well, that's something.
Will someone tell me what is the matter with him?
Some sort of infection. We'll know more after the test results.
Now, Allons-y! Back downstairs, eh? See about those engines. Go.
Hey! Go.
Call us if there's news. Any questions?
Yeah. Who are you? I'm the Doctor.
COMPUTER: Heat shield failing at 25%, Impact in 32:50.
Hurry up, will you?
All right. Fix the clamp on.
What are you typing?
These doors’ trip code is the answer to a random question set by the crew.
Nine tours back, we got drunk, thought them up.
Reckoning was, if we're hijacked, we're the only ones who know all the answers.
So you type in the right answer...
This sends a remote pulse to the clamp.
But we only get one chance per door. Get it wrong, the whole system freezes.
Better not get it wrong, then.
Okay.
"Date of SS Pentallian’s first flight?” That's all right. Go!
“Yes!
Twenty eight more to go!
(MARTHA LAUGHING) Abi, how's Korwin doing? Any results from the bio-scan?
He's under heavy sedation.
I'm just trying to make sense of this data.
Give me a couple of minutes and I'll let you know.
Martha, Riley, how are you doing?
Area 29, at the door to 28.
Yeah, you've got to move faster.
We're doing our best.
“Find the next number in the sequence: 313, 331, 367." What?
You said the crew knew all the answers, The crew's changed since we set the questions.
You're joking.
379.
MARTHA: What?
It's a sequence of happy primes. 379.
Happy what?
Just enter it.
Are you sure? We only get one chance.
Any number that reduces to one when you take the sum of the square of its digits and continue iterating until it yields one is a happy number.
Any number that doesn't, isn't. A happy prime is a number that's both happy and prime. Now type it in!
I don't know. Talk about dumbing down.
Don't they teach recreational mathematics any more?
(BEEPING) We're through!
DOCTOR: Keep moving fast as you can.
And, Martha, be careful. There may be something else onboard the ship.
Any time you want to unnerve me, feel free.
Will do, thanks.
COMPUTER: Impact in 30:50.
I can't believe our lives depend on some stupid pub quiz.
Is that the next one?
Oh, this is a nightmare.
"Classical music, who had the most pre-download number ones, “Elvis Presley or The Bee-atles?” How are we supposed to know that?
We need a backup in case they don't reach the auxiliary engine in time.
Come on, think. Resources. What have we got?
MARTHA: Doctor?
What is it now?
Who had the most number ones, Elvis or The Beatles?
That's pre-download.
Elvis.
No, The Beatles! No, wait...
Oh, what was that remix?
I don't know. I am a bit busy.
Fine. I'll ask someone else.
Now, where was I? Here Comes the Sun. No, resources.
So, the power's still working.
The generator's going. If we can harness that... Ah!
Use the generator to jumpstart the ship.
Exactly. At the very least, it will buy some more time.
That is brilliant.
I know. See?
Tiny glimmer of hope.
If it works.
Oh, believe me, you're gonna make it work.
That told him.
COMPUTER: Impact in 29:46.
(MOBILE RINGING) Hello?
Mum, it's me. It's Martha. Wow!
Where are you? Don't you check your messages? I've been calling you.
Actually, a bit busy. I need you to do something for me.
No, listen to me. We have to talk about the Doctor.
Mum, please, not now! I need you to look something up on the Internet.
Do it yourself. You've got a computer.
Oh, just do it, will you?
Please.
When did you get so rude?
I'll tell you when. Ever since you met that man.
I need to know who has more number ones, The Beatles or Elvis.
Hang on. The mouse is unplugged.
(GROANING) Okay, hang on. What is this, pub quiz?
Yeah, pub quiz.
Using your mobile is cheating.
Have you found it?
There's over 400,000 results. Give me a minute.
COMPUTER: Impact in 28:50.
Doctor, these readings are starting to scare me.
What do you mean?
Look, Korwin's body is changing.
His whole biological make-up... It's impossible.
(BEEPING) This is med centre. Urgent assistance requested. Urgent assistance!
Stay here! Keep working!
Urgent assistance!
Abi, they're on their way.
What's happening to you?
(IN ALIEN VOICE) Burn with me.
(OVER PA) Burn with me.
Captain? I told you to stay in Engineering.
I only take orders from one person round here.
Oh, is he always this cheery?
Elvis.
What?
Really? Elvis!
Burn with me.
Korwin, you're sick.
Burn with me!
Mum, you're a star.
Now, we need to have a serious...
What was that?
I've got to go.
Doctor, what were those screams?
Concentrate on those doors. You gotta keep moving forward!
COMPUTER: Impact in 27:06.
Korwin's gone.
Oh, my God.
Tell me that's not Lerner.
Endothermic vaporisation.
I've never seen one this ferocious.
"Burn with me." That's what we heard Korwin say.
What?
Do you think... No way.
Scannell, tell him. Korwin is not a killer.
He can't vaporise people. He's human. These bio-scan results.
Internal temperature, 100 degrees.
Body oxygen replaced by hydrogen. Your husband hasn't been infected.
He's been overwhelmed.
The test results are wrong.
What is it, though? A parasite? A mutagenic virus?
Something that needs a host body, but how did it get inside him?
Stop talking like he's some kind of experiment.
Where's this ship been? Have you made planetfall recently?
Docked with any other vessels? Any sort of external contact at all?
What is this, an interrogation?
We've got to stop him before he kills again.
We're just a cargo ship.
Doctor, if you give her a minute...
I'm fine. I need to warn the crew.
Everybody listen to me. Something has infected Korwin.
We think he killed Abi Lerner.
None of you must go anywhere near him. Is that clear?
ASHTON: Understood, Captain.
Erina, get back here with that equipment.
Whatever you say, boss.
“Go there. Come back. Fetch this. Carry these. Make drinks. Sweep up.” Please, kill me now.
Burn with me.
Burn with me.
COMPUTER: Impact in 24:51.
Is the infection permanent? Can you cure him?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me, Doctor.
Eleven years we've been married. We chose this ship together.
He keeps me honest. So don't want false hope.
The parasite’s too aggressive. Your husband's gone.
There's no way back. Sorry.
Thank you.
Are you certain nothing happened to provoke this?
Nobody's working on anything secret? ‘Cause it's vital that you tell me.
I know every inch of this ship.
I know every detail of my crew's lives. There is nothing.
Then why is this thing so interested in you?
I wish I knew.
MARTHA: Doctor, we've moved to area 17.
Keep going. You've got to get to area 1 and reboot those engines.
(DOOR OPENING) You got those tools, Erina? ‘Cause I'm...
(EXCLAIMING) Korwin, it's me. We're mates.
They are getting too far. We must share the light.
COMPUTER: Heat shields failing at 20%.

Everything on this ship is so cheap.
(DOOR OPENING) Who's there?
MARTHA: Is that Korwin? RILEY: No, wait a minute.
Oh, Ashton, what are you doing?
(IN ALIEN VOICE) Burn with me.
Well, if you want to help...
Burn with me.
Burn with me.
No! Come on!
What is happening on this ship?
Never mind that. Where are we?
COMPUTER: Airlock field. Jettison escape pod.
Does it mean us? Doctor!
COMPUTER: Pod jettison initiated.
Doctor, we're stuck in an escape pod of the area-17 airlock.
One of the crew's trying to jettison us. You've got to help us!
Tell me you can stop it.
Why is this happening?
Stay here.
I mean it this time. Don't start those engines!
He's picking us off one by one.
COMPUTER: jettison held.
Thank you.
COMPUTER: Jettison reactivated.
Come on.
Sierpinski sequence. This'll get him.
COMPUTER: Jettison held. Escape pod stabilised.
You're pretty good.
Ashton!
Someone's hacked at the systems.
I can't re-root the generators.
There's no way I'm gonna be able to jumpstart the ship.
SCANNELL: Who the hell did that?
Korwin?
What are you? Why are you killing my crew?
What did you do to him? What have you done to my husband?
You recognise me. Korwin, you know me.
It's Kath, your wife.
My wife?
That's right.
You're still in there. I'm your wife.
It's your fault.
That's enough!
What do you want? Why this ship? Tell me.
(SCREAMING) COMPUTER: jettison activated.
He's crushed the circuit. I can’t stop it. I can't stop it!
What do you mean, it's my fault?
It's your fault. Now burn with me.
(KORWIN SHRIEKING) What are you doing?
Freezing him. Ice vents.
You'll kill him!
Come on, let's see you.
I want to know what you really are.
COMPUTER: Airlock sealed.
McDonnell, Ashton's heading in your direction.
He's been infected, just like Korwin.
Korwin's dead, Doctor.
Everything's locked.
COMPUTER: Airlock decompression completed.
Jettisoning pod.
(BEEPING) Doctor! I'll save you.
Martha, it's too late.
Doctor! I'll save you.
I can't hear you.
(INAUDIBLE) Sorry.
COMPUTER: Impact in 17:05.
What did he mean, your fault?
What are you doing? Don't touch him. He's infected.
We don't know how it spreads.
You murdered him.
He was about to kill you.
He recognised me.
You heard the Doctor. It isn't Korwin any more.
The Doctor doesn't know. None of us know.
So what are you gonna do? Stay there until we burn?
‘Cause without you, none of us stand a chance of getting out of here.
DOCTOR: Scannell, I need a spacesuit in area 17 now!
What for?
Just get down here!
Well, go on. Do what he says.
Ashton's still out there. I'll deal with him.
The wonderful world of space travel.
The prettier it looks, the more likely it is to kill you.
He'll come for us.
No, it's too late.
Our heat shields will pack in any minute and then we go into free fall.
We'll fall into the sun way before he has a chance to do anything.
You don't know the Doctor. I believe in him.
Then you're lucky. I've never found anyone worth believing in.
No girlfriend? Boyfriend?
The job doesn’t lend itself to stable relationships.
Family, then?
My dad's dead.
I haven't seen my mum in six years.
She didn’t want me to sign on for cargo tours.
Things were said, and since then, all silent.
She wanted to hold on to me. I know that. God, she’s so stubborn.
Yeah, well, that's families.
What about you?
Full works. Mum, dad, dad’s girlfriend, brother, sister. There's no silence there, So much noise.
God, they'll never know.
I'll just have disappeared, and they'll always be waiting.
Call them.
Ashton!
(GROANING) I can't let you do this.
You're wasting your breath, Scannell.
You're not gonna stop me.
You want to open an airlock in flight on a ship spinning into the sun. No one can survive that.
Oh, just you watch.
You open that airlock, it's suicide.
This close to the sun, the shields will barely protect you.
If I can boost the magnetic lock on the ship's exterior, it should re-magnetise the pod. Now, while I'm out there, you've got to get the rest of those doors open. We need those auxiliary engines.
Doctor, will you listen. They're too far away. It's too late.
I'm not gonna lose her.

It's me again. Sorry about earlier.
Is everything all right?
Yeah. Of course.
Martha?
Mum...
You know I love you, don't you?
Of course, I do.
What's brought this on?
I never say it.
I never get the time or never think of it, and then...
I really love you.
Tell Dad, Leo and Tish that I love them, too.
Martha, what's wrong?
Nothing, promise.
Where are you? Just out.
With anyone nice?
Some mates.
What mates?
Mum, can we not just talk?
Of course. What do you want to talk about?
I don't know. Anything.
What you had for breakfast, what you watched on telly last night, how much you're gonna kill Dad next time you see him, just anything.
Is the Doctor with you? Is he there now?
Mum, just leave it.
It's a simple enough question.
I better go.
No, Martha, wait.
See ya, Mum.

What's happened?
It's your fault, Captain McDonnell.
Riley, get down to area 10 and help Scannell with the doors.
Go!
You mined that sun, stripped its surface for cheap fuel.
You should have scanned for life!
I don't understand.
Doctor, what are you talking about?
That's sun's alive, a living organism.
They scooped out its heart, used it for fuel and now it's screaming!
What do you mean? How can a sun be alive? Why is he saying that?
Because it's living in me.
Oh, my God.
Humans!
You grab whatever's nearest and bleed it dry!
You should've scanned!
It takes too long. We'd be caught.
Fusion scoops are illegal.
Martha, you've got to freeze me, quickly.
What?
Stasis chamber.
Look, you've got to take me to below 200. Freeze it out of me.
It'll use me to kill you if you don't.

Or did I say orange?
Come on!
Martha, where are you?
It's all right. I'm here.
Just setting everything up. Stasis chamber, minus 200, yeah?
But you don't know how this equipment works. You'll kill him.
Nobody can survive those temperatures.
He's not human. If he says he can survive, then he can.
Let me help you, then.
You've done enough damage.
Ten seconds. That's all I'll be able to take.
Martha!
Yeah?
It's burning me up. I can't control it.
If you don't get rid of it, I could kill you. I could kill you all.
I'm scared. I'm so scared.
Just stay calm.
You saved me. Now I return the favour. Just believe in me.
It's burning. Kill me. Then it won't happen.
That's enough. I've got you.
There's this process... this thing that happens if I'm about to die...
Shh! Quiet now, ‘cause that is not going to happen.

Off we go.
Ah! They're following us.
How can they do that? You've got a time machine.
Stolen technology. They've got a time agent's vortex manipulator.
They can follow us wherever we go.
Right across the universe. They're never going to stop.
Unless... I'll have to do it.
Martha, you trust me, don't you?
Of course I do, Cause it all depends on you.
What does? What am I supposed to do?
Take this watch because my life depends on it.
This watch, Martha, this watch is...
(KNOCK ON DOOR) Come in.
Pardon me, Mr Smith, you're not dressed yet. I can come back later.
No, it’s all right, it’s all right, put it down.
I was...
Sorry, sorry.
Sometimes I have these extraordinary dreams.
What about, sir?
I dream I'm this...
adventurer.
This daredevil, a madman.
"The Doctor", I'm called.
And last night, I dreamt that you were there, as my... companion.
A teacher and a housemaid, sir? That's impossible.
I'm a man from another world, you know.
Well, then it can't be true ‘cause there's no such thing.
This thing, the watch...
It's funny how dreams slip away.
But I do remember one thing.
It all took place in the future.
In the year of our Lord, 2007.
I can prove that wrong for you, sir.
Here's the morning paper.
It's Monday November 10, 1913, and you're completely human, sir.
As human as they come.
Mmm. That's me.
Completely human.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Headmaster.
“The French were all but spent, “with only two battalions of the old guard remaining.
“The final reserve force was charged with protecting Napoleon.
“But by evening, the advance of the allied troops "had forced them to retreat." Morning, sir.
Yes, hi.
Head in the clouds, that one. I don't know why you're so sweet on him.
He's just kind to me, that's all.
Not everyone's that considerate, what with me being...
A Londoner?
Exactly. Good old London town!
(BOTH LAUGHING) Now then, you two.
You're not paid to have fun, are you? Put a little backbone into it.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
You there. What's your name again?
Martha, sir. Martha Jones.
Well, tell me then, Jones, with hands like those, how can you tell when something's clean?
(LAUGHING) That's very funny, sir.
Careful now, don't tense about it.
I'd like to smack my bucket over his head.
Oh, I wish!
Just think, though.
Ina few years’ time, boys like that will be running the country.
1913.
They might not.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Oh, good morning, Mr Smith.
Oh! Here we go.
Let me help you.
No, no, I've got it, no.
Er... Just to retrieve... So, if you could take these...
Thank you.
There we are.
Good.
No harm done.
So, how was Jenkins?
Oh, just a cold, nothing serious.
I think he's missing his mother more than anything.
Ah, can't have that.
He received a letter this morning, so he's a lot more chipper.
I appear to be holding your books.
Yes, so you are, sorry. Sorry.
Yes, just let me...
No, why don't I take half?
Brilliant idea. Brilliant. Perfect. Division of labour.
We make quite a team.
Don't we just?
So these books, were they being taken in any particular direction?
Yes, um, this way.
I always say, Matron, you give the boys a good head of steam, they'll soon wear themselves out.
Truth be told, when it's just you and me, I'd much rather you call me Nurse Redfern.
Matron sounds rather, well, matronly.
Ah! Nurse Redfern it is, then.
Though we've known each other all of two months, you could even say Joan.
Joan?
That's my name.
Well, obviously.
And it's John, isn’t it?
Yes, it is, yes.
Have you seen this, John? The annual dance at the village hall tomorrow?
It's nothing formal, but rather fun by all accounts.
Do you think you'll go?
I hadn't thought about it.
It's been ages since I've been to a dance, only no one's asked me.
Well, I should imagine that you'd be...
I mean... I mean, I never thought you'd be one for...
There's no reason why you shouldn't, if you do, you may not...
I probably won't, but even if I did, then I...
I couldn't, um... I wouldn't want to...
The stairs.
What about the stairs?
They're right behind you.
(GROANS) Stop it. I get boys causing less fuss than this.
But it hurts, Is he all right?
Excuse me, Martha.
It's hardly good form to enter a master's study without knocking.
Sorry. You're right, yeah.
But is he all right? They said you fell down the stairs, sir.
It was just a tumble, that's all.
Have you checked for concussion? I have, And I dare say I know a lot more about it than you.
Sorry. I'll just tidy your things.
I was just telling Nurse Redfern, Matron, about my dreams. They are quite remarkable tales.
I keep imagining that I'm someone else and that I'm hiding.
Hiding. In what way?
Erm...
They're almost every night and...
This is going to sound silly. Tell me.
I dream, quite often, that...
That I have two hearts, Well then, I can be the judge of that. Let's find out.
(HEART BEATING) I can confirm the diagnosis. Just one heart. Singular.
I have, um, I have written down some of these dreams in the form of fiction.
Not that it would be of any interest. I'd be very interested.
Yeah? Well...
Never actually shown it to anyone before.
"A Journal of Impossible Things.” Look at these creatures. Such imagination.
Oh. It's become quite a hobby.
Oh.
It's wonderful.
You have quite an eye for the pretty girls.
Oh, no, no, she's just an invention. This character Rose. | call her Rose.
Seems to disappear later on.
Oh, that's the box, the blue box. It's always there.
Like a magic carpet...
This fun little box that transports me to faraway places.
Like a doorway?
Mmm.
I sometimes think how magical life would be if stories like this were true.
JOAN: If only.
It's just a dream.
Ma'am.
That book.
Oh, I'll look after it, don't worry.
He did say I could read it.
But it's silly, that's all.
Just stories.
Who is he, Martha?
I'm sorry?
It's like he's left the kettle on, like he knows he has something to get back to, but he can't remember what.
It's just him.
You arrived with him, didn't you?
He found you employment here at the school, isn't that right?
I used to work for the family. He just sort of inherited me.
Well, I'd be careful. If you don't mind my saying, you sometimes seem a little familiar with him.
Best remember your position.
Yes, ma'am.
Ah, Latimer, here you are.
Latin translation.
Blasted Catullus. I want it done by morning.
Yes, sir.
And no mistakes.
I want it written in my best handwriting.
Listen, Father says he’s been promoted. That means more money.
Might end up in a better school.
Ah, you should enjoy it, sir.
My uncle had a six-month posting in Johannesburg.
Says it was the most beautiful countryside on God's earth.
What are you talking about?
Africa.
Your father.
Have you been reading my post?
What?
Who said Africa?
I've only just read the word myself.
How did you know that? I haven't...
Have you been spying on me?
No. I just guessed.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm good at guessing, that's all.
Idiot.
Sometimes I say things and they turn out to be correct.
Just little things. Tiny things. I can’t help it.
It's just some sort of luck.
Right. Well, never mind that little toad. Who's for beer?
You've got beer?
No, but Baxter's hidden a secret supply in Blackdown Woods, Well, what are you waiting for?
Make sure the bursar's down the pub before you go past his window.
A bottle for everyone, is it?
And none for the filth.
And hurry back, Baines. I'm parched.
Ooh, it's freezing out here. Why can't we have a drink inside the pub?
Don't be ridiculous. You do get these notions.
It's all very well those suffragettes, but that's London. That's miles away.
Don't you want to scream sometimes, having to bow and scrape and behave?
Don't you just want to tell them?
I don't know.
Things must be different in your country.
Well, they are. Thank God I'm not staying here.
You keep saying that.
Just you wait. One more month and I'm as free as the wind.
Wish you could come with me, Jenny. You'd love it.
Where you gonna go?
Anywhere.
Just look up there.
Imagine you could go all the way out to the stars.
You don't half say mad things.
That's where I'm going. Into the sky, all the way out.
Hmm!
Did you see that?
See what?
Did you see it, though?
Right up there, just for a second.
Martha, there's nothing there.
Matron, are you all right?
Did you see that? There was something in the woods.
“This light.
Anything wrong, ladies?
Far too cold to be standing round in the dark.
JOAN: There. There. Look, in the sky.
Oh, that's beautiful.
All gone. Commonly known as a meteorite.
It's just rocks falling to the ground, that's all.
Came down in the woods.
No, no, they always look close, but actually they're miles off.
Nothing left but a cinder.
Now, I should escort you back to the school.
Ladies?
No, we're fine, thanks.
Then I shall bid you good night.
Jenny, where was that?
On the horizon, where the light was headed.
That's by Coopers Field.
You can’t just run off! It's dark. You'll break a leg!
I say, hello?
Some kind of aeroplane?
You chaps all right?
What? That's... That's impossible.
Some kind of door.
(ECHOING) Hello?
Is there anyone there?
There you are. Nothing there. I told you so.
And that's Coopers Field?
As far as the eye can see, and no falling star.
Now, come on, I'm frozen to the bone. Let's go.
As your Mr Smith says, “Nothing to see." But I don't understand. Who are you?
MALE VOICE: We are the Family.
FEMALE VOICE: Far more important, who are you, little thing?
My name's Baines. Jeremy Baines. Please, can I go?
FEMALE VOICE: I'm so sorry, Baines, Jeremy Baines, but I don’t think you can ever leave.
But who are you? Why can't I see you?
MALE VOICE: Why would you want to see us?
I want to know what you look like.
FEMALE VOICE: Of, that's easily answered because very soon, we will look so familiar.
Where is he? Promises a beer and then vanishes into the night.
There he is. Let him in.
Well, Baines, you dolt. Thought you'd been caught by the rozzers.
Well, then?
Where is it, man? Where's the blessed beer?
There was no beer. It was gone.
Damn it all, I've been waiting.
Pretty poor show, Baines, I have to say.
(SNIFFS) What's the matter with you? Caught the sniffles out there?
Yes, I must have. It was cold.
Very cold.
Well, don't spread it about. I don't want your germs.
Come on, might as well get some sleep.
Come on, chaps, maybe tomorrow. Jackson's got some beer in the pavilion.
Hello.
Talking to a machine.
DOCTOR: Get down!
Ah! They're following us.
They can follow us wherever we go.
Right across the universe. They're never gonna stop.
Martha, you trust me, don't you?
Of course I do, ‘Cause it all depends on you.
Martha, this watch is me.
Right, okay, gotcha.
No! Hold on! Completely lost.
Those creatures are hunters. They can sniff out anyone.
And me being a Time Lord, well, I'm unique.
They can track me down across the whole of time and space.
Huh. And the good news is?
They can smell me, they haven't seen me, and their life supplies are running out, so we hide.
Wait for them to die.
But they can track us down.
That's why I've got to do it.
I have to stop being a Time Lord.
I'm gonna become human.
Never thought I'd use this.
All the times I've wondered.
What does it do?
Chameleon Arch.
Rewrites my biology.
It literally changes every single cell in my body. I've set it to human.
The Tardis will take care of everything.
Invent a life story for me, find me a setting and integrate.
It can't do the same for you. You'll just have to improvise.
I should have just enough residual awareness to let you in.
Hold on, if you're going to rewrite every cell, isn't it going to hurt?
Oh, yeah. It'll hurt.
Is this working?
Martha, before I change, here's a list of instructions for when I'm human.
One, don't let me hurt anyone.
We can't have that, but you know what humans are like.
Two, don’t worry about the Tardis.
I'll put it on emergency power so they can't detect it. Just let it hide away.
Four... No.
Wait a minute. Three, no getting involved in big historical events.
Four, you. Don't let me abandon you.
And five...
But there was a meteor, a shooting star, what am I supposed to do then?
And 23, if anything goes wrong, if they find us, Martha, then you know what to do.
Open the watch.
Everything I am is kept safe in there.
I've put a perception filter on it so the human me won't think anything of it.
To him, it’s just a watch. But don't open it unless you have to.
‘Cause once it’s open, then the Family will be able to find me.
It's all down to you, Martha, Your choice.
Oh! And thank you.
I wish you'd come back.
(KNOCKING) (KNOCKING) You told me to come and collect that book, sir.
Good lad, yes, yes!
The Definitive Account of Mafeking by Aitchinson Price.
Where did I put it?
And I wanted a little word. Your marks aren't quite good enough.
I'm top 10 in my class, sir.
Now, be honest, Timothy. You should be the very top.
You're a clever boy. You seem to be hiding it.
Where is that book?
And I know why. Keeping your head low avoids the mockery of your classmates.
But no man should hide himself, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
You're clever.
FEMALE VOICE: Time Lord.
You should be proud of it. Use it.
(WHISPERING VOICES) Time Lord.
FEMALE VOICE: Timothy, hide us.
DOCTOR: The secret lies within. I'm trapped. I'm caged.
Inside the cold, in the dark, waiting.
FEMALE VOICE: Reach out, boy, Reach out. DOCTOR: Always waiting.
Fascinating details about the siege, really quite remarkable.
Are you all right?
Yes, sir. Fine, sir.
Right, then. Good.
And remember, use that brain of yours.
The power of a Time Lord.
You're really not looking yourself, old chap. Anything bothering you?
No, sir. Thank you, sir.
DOCTOR: You are not alone. Keep me hidden.
(WHISPERING VOICES) FEMALE VOICE: Burn with the light. Burn and turn!
MAN: Now, boys, come along now.
Classes are ready...
Come along, Jenkins.
BAINES: There is a trace, but somehow scattered.
The scent is confused.
Nevertheless, we'd best arm ourselves.
Activate the soldiers.
That is my property! And you are trespassing on my land!
Come on, who's in there?
Is it one of those idiot boys from the school, is it? Eh?
Come on. I suppose...
Well, how did you...
No! No! Help me!
Help me!
(SCREAMS) SMITH: Concentrate.
Hutchinson, excellent work.
Cease fire!
Good day to you, Headmaster.
Your crew's on fine form today, Mr Smith.
Excuse me, Headmaster. We could do a lot better.
Latimer's being deliberately shoddy.
I'm trying my best.
You need to be better than the best.
Those targets are tribesmen from the Dark Continent.
That's exactly the problem, sir. They only have spears.
Oh, dear me.
Latimer takes it upon himself to make us realise how wrong we all are.
I hope, Latimer, that one day you may have a just and proper war in which to prove yourself.
Now, resume firing.
(BOMB WHISTLING) Under the wire!
Keep your heads down!
One minute past the hour. It's now.
Hutchinson, this is the time. It's now.
Stoppage. Immediate action.
Didn't I tell you, sir? The stupid boy's useless.
Permission to give Latimer a beating, sir.
It's your class, Mr Smith.
Permission granted.
Right. Come with me, you little oik.
(SNIFFS) Anything the matter, Baines?
I thought... No, sir, nothing, sir.
As you were, Mr Smith.
Er, Pemberton, Smythe, Wicks, take post.
Ah!
Nurse Redfern.
I'll give you back your journal when next I see you.
No, no, no, you don't have to.
If you'll excuse me, Mr Smith, I was just thinking about the day my husband was shot.
His name was Oliver. He died at the Battle of Spion Kop.
We were childhood sweethearts.
But, you see, I was angry with the army for such a long time.
And you still are.
I find myself as part of that school, watching boys learn how to kill.
Don't you think discipline is good for them?
Does it have to be such military discipline?
If there's another war, those boys won't find it so amusing.
Well, Great Britain's at peace, long may it reign.
In your journal, in one of your stories, you wrote about next year, 1914.
It was just a dream.
All those images of mud and wire.
You told of a shadow. A shadow falling across the entire world.
Well, then, we can be thankful it's not true.
I'll admit, mankind doesn't need warfare and bloodshed to prove itself.
Everyday life can provide honour and valour and...
Let's hope that from now on this country can find its heroes in smaller places.
In the most ordinary of...
Of deeds.
(WOMAN SCREAMS) (BABY CRYING) Are you all right?
Lucky.
That was luck?
Miss Redfern, might I invite you to the village dance this evening as my guest?
You extraordinary man!
Oh, it's all becoming clear now. The Doctor is the man you'd like to be, doing impossible things with cricket balls.
Well, I discovered a talent, that's certainly true.
But the Doctor has an eye for the ladies.
“The devil!
A girl at every fireplace.
Ah! Now, there I have to protest, Joan. That is hardly me.
Says the man dancing with me tonight.
That scarecrow’s all askew.
Ever the artist. Where did you learn to draw?
Gallifrey.
Is that in Ireland?
Yes, it must be.
You're not Irish.
Not at all, no. My father, Sidney, was a watchmaker from Nottingham and my mother, Verity, was...
Well, she was a nurse, actually.
Oh?
We make such good wives.
Really? Right.
Yes.
Well, my work is done, what do you think?
Masterpiece.
All sorts of skills today.
Can I see?
Oh, goodness. Do I look like that?
Are you sure that's not me?
No, it's certainly this page. You like it?
You've made me far too beautiful.
Well, that's how I see you.
Widows aren't supposed to be beautiful.
I think the world would rather we stopped.
Is that fair?
That we stop?
That's not fair at all.
I've never, um...
(DOOR OPENING) Martha, what have I told you about entering unannounced?
Wasn't on the list.
(VIDEO FAST FORWARDING) Four, you. Don't let me abandon you.
That's no good.
What about the stuff you didn't tell me? What about women?
Oh, no, you didn't think of that.
What the hell am I supposed to do, then?
Thank you.
You had to, didn't you?
You had to go and fall in love with a human.
And it wasn't me.
FEMALE VOICE: The darkness is coming.
DOCTOR: Keep me away from the false and empty man.
MALE VOICE: The last of the Time Lords, the last of that wise and ancient race.
(VOICES MINGLING) Who's that playing silly beggars? Nearly broke me neck.
Who's that, then? Is that you, Saul?
(JENNY WHIMPERING) I don't understand.
It's Mr Clark, isn't it?
What have I done wrong?
Nothing at all.
In fact, you're just what we need, girl.
She works at the school.
And whatever's happening seems to be centred around that establishment.
The faintest of traces, but they all lead back there.
It's Baines, isn't it?
This isn't very funny, sir.
Just shut up, stop talking, cease and desist. There's a good girl!
Mother of mine is dying to meet you.
And here she is.
Stop mocking me, sir!
No!
Mother of mine just needs a shape.
We go through shapes so very fast.
Yours is perfectly adequate.
If a little grim.
Mother of mine, embrace her.
You look wonderful.
You'd best give me some warning. Um... Can you actually dance?
Um... I'm not certain.
There's a surprise.
Is there anything you're certain about?
Yes. Yes.
There you are. Come look what I've got.
Mr Pool didn't want his afternoon tea, so cook said I could have it.
And there's enough for two. What are you standing there for?
Are you all right?
I must have a cold coming on.
Problem is, I keep thinking about them, but I don't know what to do.
Thinking about who?
Mr Smith and Matron, ‘cause it's never gonna last, he's gonna leave in a few weeks.
Why?
It's like his contract comes to an end and she's going to be heartbroken.
Leave for where?
All sorts of places.
Oh, I wish I could tell you, Jenny, but it's complicated.
In what way?
I just can't.
It sounds so interesting. Tell me. Tell me now.
Would you like some tea?
Yes, thanks.
I could put a nice bit of gravy in the pot and some mutton.
Or sardines and jam, how about that?
I like the sound of that.
Right. Hold on a tick.
They've found us! “This is ridiculous.
Martha, I've warned you.
They've found us and I've seen them!
They look like people, like us, like normal.
I'm sorry, but you've got to open the watch.
Where is it?
Oh, my God! Where's it gone? Where's the watch?
What are you talking about?
You had a watch, a fob watch, right there.
Did I? I don't remember.
I can't think what concern it is of yours.
But we need it. Oh, my God, Doctor.
We're hiding from aliens and they've got Jenny and they've possessed her or copied her or something, and you've got to tell me, where's the watch?
Oh, I see.
Cultural differences, It must be so confusing for you.
Martha, this is what we call a story.
Oh, you complete...
This is not you. This is 1913.
Good. This is 1913.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, but I've got to snap you out of this.
Martha!
Wake up! You're coming back to the Tardis with me.
How dare you! I'm not going anywhere with an insane servant.
Martha, you are dismissed. You will leave these premises immediately.
Now, get out!
The nerve of it! The absolute cheek!
You think I'm a fantasist, what about her?
The funny thing is, you did have a fob watch.
Right there. Don't you remember?
Oh! Sorry!
Sorry!
Martha?
Not now, Tim, I'm busy!
Mr Smith?
No one home.
The maid was definitely hiding something.
A secret around this Mr Smith.
We both scented him, though, he was plain and simply human.
But maybe he knows something.
Where is he?
She's infatuated. You're a dangerous man.
You've taken my arm in public.
I'm very scared.
Spare a penny for the veterans of the Crimea, sir?
Yes, of course. There you are, then.
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your partners for a waltz.
You can dance.
Quite surprised myself.
Oh, I say! Sorry.
I think this might help.
That makes it easy, Son of mine, because Daughter of mine's already there.
We've been invited to the dance.
Oh, staff entrance I think, miss.
Yeah, well, think again, mate.
Please don't. Not again.
He's different from any other man you've ever met, right?
Yes.
And sometimes he says these strange things, like people and places you've never heard of, yeah?
But it's deeper than that.
Sometimes when you look in his eyes, you know, you just know that there's something else in there.
Something hidden.
Right behind the eyes, something hidden away.
In the dark.
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.
I don't mean to be rude, but the awful thing is it doesn’t even matter what you think.
But you're nice and you're lucky.
And I just wanted to say sorry for what I'm about to do.
Oh, now, really, Martha, this is getting out of hand.
I must insist that you leave.
Do you know what this is?
Name it.
Go on, name it.
John, what is that silly thing?
John?
You're not John Smith.
You're called the Doctor.
The man in your journal, he's real.
He's you.
Evening, all! Spare a penny, sir?
I didn’t spare you.
You will be silent!
All of you!
I said, silent!
Mr Clark, what's going on?
Mr Smith, everything I told you, just forget it.
Don't say anything.
We asked for silence!
Now then, we have a few questions for Mr Smith.
No, better than that.
The teacher, he's the Doctor.
I heard them talking.
You took human form.
Of course I'm human! I was born human, as were you, Baines!
And Jenny and you, Mr Clark.
What is going on? This is madness!
Ooh, and a human brain, too. Simple, thick and dull.
But he's no good like this.
We need a Time Lord.
Easily done.
(ALL GASP) Change back.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Change back!
I literally do not know...
Get off me!
She's your friend, isn't she?
Doesn't this scare you enough to change back?
I don't know what you mean!
Wait a minute, The maid told me about Smith and the matron.
That woman, there.
Then let's have you!
Have you enjoyed it, Doctor? Being human?
Has it taught you wonderful things? Are you better, richer, wiser?
Then let's see you answer this.
Which one of them do you want us to kill?
Maid or matron?
Your friend or your lover?
Your choice, We are the Family of Blood.
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING) Save us.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
DOCTOR: Get down!
Ah! They're following us.
And the good news is?
Their life spans are running out, so we hide, wait for them to die.
I have to stop being a Time Lord. I'm going to become human.
Chameleon Arch. Rewrites my biology.
"A Journal of Impossible Things.” Such imagination!
It's become quite a hobby.
He's different from any man you've ever met, right?
Yes.
He had to go and fall in love with a human. And it wasn't me.
If they find us, Martha, open the watch.
Sometimes I say things and they turn out to be correct.
They've found us.
Oh, my God! Where's the watch?
What are you talking about?
This is not you. This is 1913.
Change back!
We need a Time Lord.
Which one of them do you want us to kill?
Doesn't this scare you enough to change back?
Your friend or your lover?
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) JENNY: Make your decision, Mr Smith.
BAINES: Perhaps if that human heart breaks, the Time Lord will emerge.
Time Lord. Tim!
(SCREAMING) All right!
One more move and I shoot.
Oh, the maid is full of fire!
And you can shut up!
Careful, Son of mine.
She's all for you so that you can live forever.
Shoot you down.
Try it. We'll die together.
Would you really pull the trigger?
Looks too scared.
Scared and holding a gun is a good combination.
Do you want to risk it?
Doctor, get everyone out. There's a door at the side.
It's over there. Go on!
MARTHA: Do it, Mr Smith, I mean you!
Do what she said. Everybody out now!
Don't argue, Mr Jackson. They're mad, that's all we need to know.
Susan, Miss Cooper, outside, all of you!
Move yourself, boy. Back to the school, quickly!
And you, go on, just shift.
What about you?
Mr Smith, I think you should escort your lady friend to safety, don't you?
Mr Hicks, warn the village. Get everyone out.
Latimer, get back to the school. Tell the headmaster...
Don't touch me! You're as bad as them.
Don't try anything. I'm warning you, or sonny boy gets it.
She's almost brave, this one.
I should have taken her form.
Much more fun, so much spirit.
What happened to Jenny? Has she gone?
She is consumed. Her body's mine.
You mean she's dead?
Yes, and she went with precious little dignity.
All that screaming.
BAINES: Get the gun!
Good work, soldier.
Don't just stand there, move! God, you're rubbish as a human. Come on!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) (WEAPON FIRING) Run! Ah, this is super. We've been in hiding for too long.
This is sport!
I can smell the schoolteacher. He's gone back to his academy.
And what do we know about her?
This body has traces of memory. Was once her friend.
Martha would go walking to the west.
Husband of mine, follow the maid's scent.
Go to the west. Find out what she was keeping secret.
Soldiers!
As for you, Mother of mine, let's go to school.
What are you doing?
Maybe one man can't fight them, but this school teaches us to stand together.
Take arms! Take arms!
Stop doing that!
You want me to fight, don't you?
Take arms! Take arms!
I say, sir, what's the matter?
Enemy at the door, Hutchinson, enemy at the door.
Take arms!
They're sounding the alarms.
I wouldn't be so pleased, Son of mine.
These bodies are silly and wet, they can damage and die.
That's why we need the Time Lord.
Indeed, they will have guns. Perhaps a little caution.
Sister of mine, you're such a small little thing.
Find a way in and spy on them.
You can't do this, Doctor. Mr Smith!
Maintain position over the stable yard.
They're just boys, you can't ask them to fight.
They don't stand a chance!
They are cadets, Miss Jones.
They are trained to defend the King and all his citizens and properties.
What in thunder's name is this?
Before I devise an excellent and endless series of punishments for each and every one of you, could someone explain, very simply and immediately, exactly what is going on?
Headmaster, I have to report, the school is under attack.
Really? Is that so?
Perhaps you and I should have a word in private.
No, I promise you, sir. I was in the village with Matron.
It's Baines, sir, Jeremy Baines, and Mr Clark from Oakham Farm.
They've gone mad, sir. They've got guns.
They've already murdered people in the village. I saw it happen.
Matron, is that so?
I'm afraid it's true, sir.
Murder? On our own soil?
I saw it, yes.
Perhaps you did well then, Mr Smith.
And what makes you think the danger is coming here?
Well, sir, they said, um...
Baines threatened Mr Smith, sir.
Said he'd follow him. We don't know why.
Very well.
You boys remain on guard, Mr Snell, telephone for the police.
Mr Phillips, with me. We shall investigate.
No! It's not safe out there.
Mr Smith, it seems your favourite servant is giving me advice.
You will control her, sir.
Got to find that watch.
DOCTOR: Hold me, keep me safe.
Keep me dark, keep me closed.
The time is not right, not yet.
Not while the Family is abroad. Danger!
So, Baines, and one of the cleaning staff. There's always a woman involved.
Am I to gather that some practical joke has got out of hand?
Headmaster, sir. Good evening, sir. Come to give me a caning, sir?
Would you like that, sir?
Keep a civil tongue, boy.
Now, come on, everyone. I suspect alcohol has played its part in this.
Let's all just calm down.
Who are these friends of yours, Baines, in fancy dress?
Do you like them, Mr Phillips? I made them myself.
I'm ever so good at science, sir. Look.
Molecular fringe animation, fashioned in the shape of straw men.
My own private army, sir. It's ever so good, sir.
Baines, step apart from this company and come inside with me.
No, sir. You, sir, you will send us Mr John Smith.
That's all we want, sir, Mr John Smith, and whatever he's done with his Time Lord consciousness.
Then we'd be very happy to leave you alone.
You speak with someone else's voice, Baines. Who might that be?
We are the Family of Blood.
Mr Smith said there had been deaths.
Yes, sir, and they were good, sir.
Well, I warn you, the school is armed.
All your little tin soldiers.
But tell me, sir, will they thank you?
I don't understand.
What do you know of history, sir? What do you know of next year?
You're not making sense, Baines.
1914, sir.
Because the Family has travelled far and wide looking for Mr Smith, and, oh, the things we have seen.
War is coming.
In foreign fields, war of the whole wide world with all your boys falling down in the mud.
Do you think they will thank the man who taught them it was glorious?
Don't you forget, boy, I have been a soldier.
Twas in South Africa. I used my dead mates for sandbags.
I fought with the butt of my rifle when the bullets ran out, and I would go back there tomorrow for King and country.
Etcetera, etcetera.
Run along, Headmaster. Run back to school.
And send us Mr Smith!
(JENNY LAUGHING) Mr Phillips has been murdered. Mr Smith, can you tell me why?
Honestly, sir, I have no idea.
And the telephone line has been disconnected. We are on our own.
Well, if we have to make a fight of it, then make a fight we shall.
Hutchinson, we'll build a barricade within the courtyards.
Fortify the entrances, build our defences.
Gentlemen, in the name of the King we shall stand against them.
ALL: Yes, sir. BOY: Right, come on. Let's get moving.
Down!
Barricade the kitchens. Secure the passageway to the stables.
You little coward.
You will do your duty, Latimer, with the rest of us.
Sandbags to the north and west!
Williams, you take charge. Pemberton, load the spare magazines with bullets.
SMITH: Take the magazine cut-off out.
They've got an army.
So do we.
Soldiers.
Soldiers!
Ashington, we need water for the Vickers gun. See to it.
Faster, all of you, faster.
Lockley, when firing commences, you're in charge of the gathering.
Peterson, that's not acceptable. Report to your senior officer.
War comes to England a year in advance.
LUCY: Family of mine, wait. Hold the soldiers back.
The Time Lord is playing some sort of trick.
BAINES: Discover him, Sister of mine.
I know it sounds mad, but when the Doctor became human, he took the alien part of himself and he stored it inside the watch.
It's not really a watch, it just looks like a watch.
And "alien" means not from abroad, I take it?
The man you call John Smith, he was born on another world.
A different species.
Yeah.
Then tell me, in this fairy tale, who are you?
Just a friend.
I'm not... I mean, you haven't got a rival, as much as I might...
Just his friend.
And human, I take it?
Human, don't worry. More than that, I don't just follow him around, I'm training to be a doctor.
Not an alien doctor, a proper doctor, a doctor of medicine.
Well, that certainly is nonsense.
Women might train to be doctors, but hardly the skivwy and hardly one of your colour.
Oh, do you think?
Bones of the hand.
Carpal bones, proximal row: scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform.
Distal row: trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate.
Then the metacarpal bones extending in three distinct phalanges: proximal, middle, distal.
Well, you read that in a book.
Yes, to pass my exams!
~Can't you see this is true?
I must go.
If we find that watch, we can stop them.
Those boys are going to fight.
I might not be a doctor, but I'm still their nurse.
They need me.
Son of mine, Wife of mine.
Father of mine, what have you found?
His Tardis.
The Doctor can't escape.
You're with Armitage and Thwaites, they know the drill.
Joan, it's not safe.
I'm doing my duty, just as much as you.
Fine evening we've had together.
Not quite as planned.
Tell me about Nottingham.
Sorry?
That's where you were brought up, tell me about it.
Well, it lies on the River Leen with its southern boundary following the course of the River Trent, which flows from Stoke to the Humber.
That sounds like an encyclopaedia. Where did you live?
Broadmarsh Street, adjacent to Hockley Terrace in the district of Radford Parade.
More than facts, When you were a child, where did you play?
All those secret little places, the dens and hideaways that only a child knows.
Tell me, John, please, tell me.
How can you think I'm not real?
When I kissed you, was that a lie?
No, it wasn't, no.
But this Doctor sounds like some... Some romantic lost prince.
Would you rather that?
Am I not enough?
No, that's not true, never.
I've got to go.
Martha was right about one thing. Those boys, they're children.
John Smith wouldn't want them to fight, never mind the Doctor.
The John Smith I was getting to know, he knows it's wrong.
Doesn't he?
Mr Smith, if you please!
What choice do I have?
Get those bags piled up, filth.
They're going to mean the difference between life and death for us.
Not for you and me.
What are you babbling about?
We go to battle together.
We fight alongside.
I've seen it. Not here, not now.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you and I both survive this.
And maybe...
Maybe I was given this watch so I could help.
I'm sorry.
Latimer, you filthy coward!
Oh, yes, sir, every time.
What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?
VOICES: Beware!
Beware of what?
VOICES: Her!
Keep away.
Who are you?
I saw you at the dance.
You were with that family, you're one of them.
What are you hiding?
Nothing.
What have you got there?
Nothing.
Show me, little boy.
I reckon, whatever you are, you're still in the shape of a girl.
How strong is she, do you think?
Does she really want to see this?
Time Lord!
Inside the device.
Everything he is, concealed away in the hands of a schoolboy.
But now we know that's all we need to find, the boy and the watch.
What are we waiting for? Attack!
(BANGING) Stand to!
(BANGING) At post!
BOY: Enemy approaching, sir.
(BANGING) Steady.
Find the biting point.
Fear...
Fire!
Cease fire!
Just straw.
Like he said. Straw!
Then no one is dead, sir. We killed no one.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Stand to!
You, child, come out of the way! Come into the school!
You don't know who's out there, It's the Cartwright girl, isn’t it? Come here, come to me.
Mr Rocastle, please, don't go near her.
You were told to be quiet.
Just listen to me, she's part of it.
Matron, tell him.
I think... I don't know, I think you should stay back, Headmaster.
Mr Smith.
She was with Baines in the village.
Mr Smith, I've seen many strange sights this night, but there is no cause on God's earth that would allow me to see this child in the field of battle, sir.
Come with me.
You're funny.
That's right. Now, take my hand.
So funny.
Now, who's going to shoot me? Any of you, really?
Put down your guns.
But, sir, the Headmaster.
I'll not see this happen, not any more.
You will retreat in an orderly fashion back through the school.
Hutchinson, lead the way.
But, sir...
I said, lead the way.
Well, go on, then. Run!
BAINES: Soldiers!
Come on!
BAINES: Reanimate!
Let's go, quick as you can!
Don't go to the village, it's not safe!
And you, ladies.
Not till we've got the boys out.
One of these boys has got the watch.
JENNY: This one?
No.
This one?
No.
JENNY: This one?
No.
Get off me! I said get off!
Ah! This one, is that him?
No.
Right, then we can kill this lot.
MALE VOICE: Lord of time.
That's him.
Upstairs!
Well, don't just stand there, outside! Come on, out!
I insist, the pair of you, just go!
If there are any more boys inside, I'll find them.
I think... Retreat!
CLARK: Doctor!
Doctor!
Come back, Doctor. Come home!
Come and claim your prize.
Out you come, Doctor, there's a good boy.
Come to the Family.
Time to end it now!
MARTHA: You recognise it, don't you?
JENNY: Come out, Doctor!
Come to us.
I've never seen it in my life.
Do you remember its name?
I'm sorry, John, but you wrote about it.
The blue box, you dreamt of a blue box.
I'm not...
I'm John Smith. That's all I want to be, John Smith!
With his life and his job.
And his love. Why can’t I be John Smith? Isn't he a good man?
Yes, yes, he is.
Why can't I stay?
But we need the Doctor.
And what am I, then? Nothing?
I'm just a story.
One more phase and we won't have to hunt.
The Doctor, Mr Smith, the boy, the watch, they will come to us.
BAINES: Soldiers, guard this thing.
This way, I think I know somewhere we can hide.
We've got to keep going.
Just listen to me for once, John.
Now, follow me.
BAINES: Power up. Fully armed and ready.
Mother, Father and Sister of mine, prepare the armaments.
I doubt that England is ready for this.
Fix targets, and counting down.
Here we are. It should be empty.
Oh, it's been a long time since I've run that far.
But who lives here?
If I'm right, no one.
Hello?
No one home. We should be safe here.
Whose house is it, though?
The Cartwrights’.
That little girl at the school, she's Lucy Cartwright, or she's taken Lucy Cartwright's form. If she came home this afternoon, and if the parents tried to stop their little girl, then...
they were vanished.
Stone cold.
How easily I accept these ideas.
I must go to them before anyone else dies.
You can't.
Martha, there must be something we can do.
Not without the watch.
You're this Doctor's companion, can't you help?
What exactly do you do for him? Why does he need you?
Because he's lonely.
And that's what you want me to become?
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) What if it's them?
I'm not an expert, but I don't think scarecrows knock.
I brought you this.
MARTHA: Hold it.
I won't.
Please, just hold it.
It told me to find you. It wants to be held.
You've had this watch all this time? Why didn't you return it?
Because it was waiting.
Then because I was so scared of the Doctor.
Why?
Because I've seen him.
He's like fire and ice and rage.
He's like the night and the storm and the heart of the sun.
Stop it.
He's ancient and forever.
He burns at the centre of time, and he can see the turn of the universe, Stop it! I said stop it.
And he's wonderful.
I've still got this, the journal.
Those are just stories.
Now we know that's not true. Perhaps there's something in here...
(EXPLOSION) What the hell?
This will flush him out, this will do it!
Super, super fun!
JOAN: They're destroying the village.
The watch!
John, don't.
DOCTOR: Closer.
~Can you hear it?
Like he's asleep.
Waiting to waken.
Why did he speak to me?
Oh, low level telepathic field, you were born with it.
Just an extra synaptic engram, causing...
Is that how he talks? “That's him!
All you have to do is open it, and he's back.
(EXPLOSION) You knew this all along and yet you watched while Miss Redfern and I...
I didn't know how to stop you.
He gave me a list of things to watch out for, but that wasn't included.
Falling in love? That didn't even occur to him?
No.
Then what sort of man is that?
And now you expect me to die?
It was always going to end, though.
The Doctor said the Family has got a limited life span, that's why they need to consume a Time Lord.
Otherwise, three months and they die.
Like mayflies, he said.
So your job was to execute me?
People are dying out there.
They need him, and I need him.
‘Cause you've got no idea what he's like.
I've only just met him, it wasn't even that long ago, but...
He is everything.
He's just everything to me, and he doesn't even look at me, but I don't care.
‘Cause I love him to bits, And I hope to God he won't remember me saying this.
It's getting closer.
I should have thought of it before. I can give them this!
Just the watch.
Then they can leave and I can stay as I am.
You can't do that!
If they want the Doctor, they can have him.
He'll never let you do it.
And if they get what they want, then...
Then it all ends in destruction.
I never read to the end.
Those creatures will live forever, to breed and conquer.
A war across the stars, for every child.
Martha, Timothy, would you leave us alone, please?
(SOBBING) If I could do this instead of you, then I would.
I'd hoped...
But my hopes aren't important.
He won't love you.
If he's not you, then I don't want him to.
I had one husband and he died and...
I never thought, ever again...
And then you.
You're So...
And it was real, I wasn't...
I really thought...
Let me see.
Blasted thing.
Blasted, blasted thing.
I can't even hear it, it says nothing to me.
(BABY CRYING) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) They're all safe, aren't they?
The children, the grandchildren.
Everyone's safe.
Everyone's safe.
And they all send their love, John.
Well, then.
It's time.
Thank you.
Did you see?
The Time Lord has such adventures.
But he could never have a life like that.
And yet I could.
What are you going to do?
We'll blast them into dust, then fuse the dust into glass then shatter them all over again!
Just...
Just stop the bombardment.
That's all I'm asking. I'll do anything you want, just stop.
Say please.
Please.
(CONTROLS DEACTIVATING) Wait a minute, Still human.
Look, I can't pretend to understand, not for a second, but I want you to know, I'm innocent in all this.
He made me John Smith. It's not like I had any control over it.
He didn't just make himself human, he made himself an idiot.
Same thing, isn’t it?
I don't care about this Doctor and your family, I just want you to go!
So I've made my choice.
You can have him.
Just take it, please, take him away!
At last!
Don't think that's saved your life!
Family of mine, now we shall have the lives of a Time Lord.
It's empty!
Where's it gone?
You tell me!
Oh, I think the explanation might be you've been fooled by a simple olfactory misdirection.
A little bit like ventriloquism of the nose.
It's an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy.
But it has got to be said, I don't like the look of that hydrokinometer.
It seems to be indicating you've got energy feedback all the way through the retrostabilisers, feeding back into the primary heat converters.
Oh!
‘Cause if there's one thing you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't have let me press all those buttons.
But, in fairness, I will give you one word of advice.
Run.
(ALARM SOUNDING) Get out! Get out!
BAINES: He never raised his voice, that was the worst thing.
The fury of the Time Lord.
And then we discovered why, why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he'd run away from us and hidden, He was being kind.
He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains forged in the heart of a dwarf star.
He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy, to be imprisoned there forever.
He still visits my sister, once a year, every year.
I wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is, can you see?
He trapped her inside a mirror.
Every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you, just for a second, that’s her.
That's always her.
As for me, I was suspended in time, and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England as their protector.
We wanted to live forever.
So the Doctor made sure that we did.
Is it done?
It's done.
The police and the army are at school.
Parents have come to take the boys home.
I should go. They'll have so many questions.
I'm not sure what to say.
Oh.
You look the same.
Goodness, you must forgive my rudeness. I...
I find it difficult to look at you.
Doctor, must call you Doctor.
Where is he?
John Smith.
He's in here, somewhere.
Like a story.
Could you change back? Yes.
Will you? “No.
I see.
Well, then.
He was braver than you, in the end.
That ordinary man.
You chose to change, he chose to die, Come with me.
Sorry?
Travel with me.
As what?
My companion.
But that's not fair.
What must I look like to you, Doctor?
I must seem so very small. “No.
We could start again. I'd like that.
You and me, we could try, at least.
‘Cause everything that John Smith is and was, I'm capable of that, too.
can't.
Please come with me.
I can't.
Why not?
John Smith is dead, and you look like him.
But he's here.
Inside.
If you look in my eyes...
Answer me this, just one question, that's all.
If the Doctor had never visited us, never chosen this place on a whim, would anyone here have died?
You can go.
Right, then, molto bene.
How was she?
Time we moved on.
If you want, I could go and...
Time we moved on.
Erm, meant to say, back there last night, I would've said anything to get you to change.
Oh, yeah, course you would.
I wasn't really...
No, no, no.
Good.
Fine.
So there we are, then.
There we are, then, yes.
And I never said.
Thanks for looking after me.
Doctor, Martha.
Tim Timothy Tim!
I just wanted to say goodbye, and thank you.
Because I've seen the future, and I now know what must be done, It's coming, isn't it? The biggest war ever.
You don't have to fight. I think we do.
But you could get hurt.
So could you, travelling around with him, but it's not going to stop you.
Tim, I'd be honoured if you'd take this.
I can't hear anything.
No, it's just a watch now. But keep it with you for good luck.
Look after yourself.
You'll like this bit.
(WHOOSHING) SOLDIER: Incoming!
DOCTOR: In June, 1914, an archduke of Austria was shot by a Serbian.
And this then lead, through nations having treaties with nations, like a line of dominoes falling, to some boys from England walking together in France on a terrible day.
One minute past the hour.
It's now.
Hutchinson, this is the time, it's now.
(SHELL WHISTLING) To the right, to the right!
We made it.
Thank you, Doctor.
Come on, old chap.
Leave me. I'm not going to make it.
Oh, yes you are.
Didn't I promise you all those years ago?
Now, come on, and that's an order!
. they went with songs to the battle. They were young, straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.
They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted.
They fell with their faces to the foe.
They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old.
Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.
Don't blink.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(GRUNTING) (DOCTOR WHO THEME) Kathy?
DOCTOR: Listen, your life could depend on this.
Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead.
They are fast. Faster than you can believe.
Don't turn your back, don't look away and don’t blink.
Good luck.
(MOBILE RINGING) Hello?
Bit freaked. Need to talk. Making you a coffee.
Sally Sparrow, it's 1:00 in the morning.
Do you think I'm going out at 1:00 in the morning?
No.
I'm in the kitchen. What's that on all those screens in your front room?
(SIGHING) Oh, God.
(TOILET FLUSHING) Oh, God. Sally, you've met my brother Larry, haven't you?
No.
You're about to.
(DOOR OPENING) Okay.
Not sure, but really, really hoping...
Pants?
No.
Put them on! Put them on! I hate you!
What are you thinking?
Sorry. My useless brother.
Sally? What's wrong?
What's happened?
Okay. Let's investigate. You and me, girl investigators.
Love it. Hey! Sparrow and Nightingale.
That so works.
Bit ITV.
I know!
What did you come here for anyway?
I love old things. They make me feel sad.
What's good about sad?
It's happy for deep people.
The weeping angel.
KATHY: Wouldn't have that in my garden.
It's moved.
It's what?
Since yesterday. I'm sure of it. It's closer.
It's got closer to the house.
How can my name be written here?
How is that possible?
(DOORBELL RINGING) Who'd come here?
What are you doing?
It could be a burglar.
A burglar who rings the doorbell?
Okay. I'll stay here in case of...
In case of?
Incidents?
Okay.
I'm looking for Sally Sparrow.
How did you know I'd be here?
I was told to bring this letter on this date at this exact time to Sally Sparrow.
Looks old. It is old.
I'm sorry, do you have anything with a photograph on it, like a driving licence?
(RATTLING) No one knew I was coming here. I didn’t tell anyone.
How could anyone have known?
MAN: It's all a bit complicated. I'm not sure I understand it myself.
Yes. Sorry, I feel really stupid. I was told to make absolutely sure.
It's so hard to tell with these little photographs, isn’t it?
Apparently.
Well, here goes, I suppose.
Funny feeling after all these years.
Who's it from?
Well, that's a long story, actually. ~Give me a name.
Katherine Wainwright.
But she specified I should tell you that, prior to marriage, she was called Kathy Nightingale.
(BANGING) Kathy?
Kathy. Yes.
Katherine Costello Nightingale.
Is this a joke?
Joke?
Kathy, is this you?
Very funny. Kathy?
Kathy? Kathy?
Please.
You need to take this. I promised.
Excuse me. Where am I?
I was in London. I was in the middle of London.
You're in Hull.
No, I'm not.
“This is Hull.
No, it isn't.
“You're in Hull. I'm not in Hull. Stop saying Hull.
Who are you? Why are you here?
I made a promise.
Who to?
My grandmother. Katherine Costello Nightingale.
Don't have that in London. There's no call for it. It's all Hull.
1920?
Your grandmother? “Yes.
She died 20 years ago.
Huh.
~So they're related?
Sorry?
My Kathy, your grandmother. They're practically identical.
Where you going?
My dearest Sally Sparrow, if my grandson has done as he promises he will, then as you read these words, it has been mere minutes since we last spoke.
For you. For me, it has been over 60 years.
The third of the photographs is of my children.
The youngest is Sally. I named her after you, of course.
This is sick.
This is totally sick.
Kathy? Kathy!
Kathy?
(FLUTTERING) (DOOR CLOSING) No, wait. Hang on!
I suppose, unless I live to a really exceptional old age, I will be long gone as you read this.
Don't feel sorry for me. I have led a good and full life.
I've loved a good man and been well loved in return.
You would have liked Ben.
He was the very first person I met in 1920.
Are you following me?
Yeah.
Are you going to stop following me?
No, I don't think so, To take one breath in 2007 and the next in 1920 is a strange way to start a new life, but a new life is exactly what I've always wanted.
1902.
You told him you were 18, you lying cow.
My mum and dad are gone by your time, so really there's only Lawrence to tell.
He works at the DVD store on Queen Street.
I don't know what you're gonna say to him, but I know you'll think of something.
Just tell him I love him.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Lawrence Nightingale.
In the back.
Hello?
Martha!
Sorry.
Quite possibly.
Afraid so, Oh. Hello.
Can I help you? “Hi, 38.
Just a moment.
Hang on. We've met, haven't we?
It'll come to you.
Oh, my God. “There it is.
Sorry. Sorry, again, about the whole...
Message from your sister.
Oh, okay.
What? What is it? What's the message?
She's had to go away for a bit.
Where?
Just a work thing. Nothing to worry about.
Okay.
And...
And... And what?
She loves you.
She what?
She said to say... She just sort of mentioned it.
She loves you. There, that's nice, isn't it?
Is she ill?
No! No.
Am I ill?
No.
Is this a trick?
No. She loves you.
People don't understand time. It's not what you think it is.
Who is this guy?
Sorry, the pause thing keeps slipping.
Stupid thing.
Last night at Kathy's, you had him on all those screens, that same guy.
Talking about, I don't know, blinking or something.
Yeah, the bit about the blinking’s great.
I was just checking to see if they were all the same.
What were the same?
What is this? Who is he?
An Easter egg.
Excuse me?
Like a DVD extra, yeah?
You know how on DVDs they put extras, you know, documentaries and stuff?
Sometimes they put on hidden ones and they call them Easter eggs.
You have to go looking for them, follow a bunch of clues on the menu screen.
Complicated.
Sorry.
It's interesting, actually. He is on 17 different DVDs.
There are 17 totally unrelated DVDs all with him on, always hidden away, always a secret. Not even the publishers know.
I've talked to the manufacturers, right? They don't even know.
He's like... He's a ghost DVD extra.
Just shows up where he's not supposed to be.
But only on those. Those 17.
Well, what does he do?
Just sits there, making random remarks.
It's like we're hearing half a conversation.
Me and the guys are always trying to work out the other half.
When you say you and the guys, you mean the internet, don't you?
How'd you know?
Spooky, isn't it?
Very complicated.
Lawrence, need you.
Excuse me a sec.
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.
It started well, that sentence.
It got away from me, yeah.
Okay, that was weird. Like you can hear me.
Well, I can hear you.
Okay, that's enough.
I've had enough now. I've had a long day and I've had bloody enough.
Sorry, bad day.
Got you the list.
What?
The 17 DVDs. I thought you might be interested.
Yeah. Great. Thanks.
Go to the police, you stupid woman.
Why does nobody ever just go to the police?
Look, I know how mad I'm sounding.
Shall we try it from the beginning this time?
Okay, there's this house, a big, old house, been empty for years, falling apart, Wester Drumlins, out by the estate.
You've probably seen it.
Wester Drumlins?
Yes, Could you just wait here for a minute?
Oh.
Okay. Cracking up now.
Hi. DI Billy Shipton. Wester Drumlins, that's mine.
Can't talk to you now, got a thing I can't be late for, so if you could just...
Hello.
Hello, Er, Marcie, can you tell them I'm going to be late for that thing?
All of them?
Over the last two years, yeah.
They all still have personal items in them and a couple still had the motor running.
So over the last two years, the owners of all of these vehicles have driven up to Wester Drumlins house, parked outside and just disappeared?
What's that? “Ah.
The pride of the Wester Drumlins collection.
We found that there, too, Somebody's idea of a joke, I suppose.
But what is it? What's a police box?
Well, it's a special kind of phone box for policemen.
They used to have them all over, but this isn't a real one.
The phone is just a dummy and the windows are the wrong size.
Can't even get in it.
Ordinary Yale lock, but nothing fits.
But that's not the big question.
See, you're missing the big question.
Okay, what's the big question?
Will you have a drink with me? I'm sorry?
Drink? You, me, now?
Aren't you on duty, Detective Inspector Shipton?
Nope. Knocked off before I Left.
Told them I had a family crisis.
Why?
Because life is short and you are hot. Drink?
No.
Ever?
Maybe.
Phone number?
Moving rather fast, DI Shipton.
Billy. I'm off duty.
Aren't you just?
Is that your phone number?
Just my phone number.
Not a promise, not a guarantee, not an IOU, just a phone number.
And that’s Sally... Sally Shipton.
Sparrow! Sally Sparrow.
Ah.
Okay, going now. Don't look at me.
I'll phone you.
Don't look at me.
Phone you tomorrow.
Don't look at me.
Might even phone you tonight.
Don't look at me.
Definitely gonna phone you, gorgeous girl.
Definitely better.
SHIPTON: Ordinary Yale lock, but nothing fits.
DOCTOR: Welcome.
Where am I?
1969, Not bad, as it goes. You've got the moon landing to look forward to.
Oh, the moon landing's brilliant! We went four times.
Back when we had transport.
Working on it.
How did I get here?
Same way we did.
Touch of an angel. Same one, probably, since you ended up in the same year.
No, no, no. Don't get up. Time travel without a capsule, nasty.
Catch your breath, don't go swimming for half an hour.
I don't... I can't...
Fascinating race, the weeping angels.
The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely.
No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye.
You die in the past and in the present they consume the energy of all the days you might have had.
All your stolen moments.
They're creatures of the abstract, they live off potential energy.
What in God's name are you talking about?
Trust me, just nod when he stops for breath.
Tracked you down with this. This is my timey-wimey detector.
Goes “bing” when there's stuff. Also, it can boil an egg at 30 paces.
Whether you want it to or not, actually, so I've learnt to stay away from hens.
It's not pretty when they blow.
I don't understand. Where am I?
1969, like he said.
Normally, I'd offer you a lift home, but somebody nicked my motor.
So I need you to take a message to Sally Sparrow.
And I'm sorry, Billy, Tam very, very sorry.
It's gonna take you a while.
(MOBILE RINGING) Hello?
Billy, where are you?
Where?
Billy?
It was raining when we met.
It's the same rain.
She looks nice.
Her name was Sally, too.
Sally Shipton. Sally Shipton.
I often thought about looking for you before tonight.
But apparently it would have torn a hole in the fabric of space and time and destroyed two thirds of the universe, Also, I'd lost my hair.
Two thirds of the universe? Where'd you get that from?
There's a man in 1969. He sent me with a message for you.
What man?
The Doctor.
And what was the message?
Just this, look at the list.
What does that mean?
Is that it? Look at the list?
He said you'd have it by now.
A list of 17 DVDs.
I didn't stay a policeman back then.
Got into publishing, then video publishing.
Then DVDs, of course.
You put the Easter egg on.
Have you noticed what all 17 DVDs have in common yet?
I suppose it's hard for you in a way.
How could the Doctor have even known Thad a list?
I only just got this.
I asked him how, but he said he couldn't tell me.
He said you'd understand it one day, but that I never would.
Soon as I understand it, I'll come and tell you.
No, gorgeous girl. You can't.
There's only tonight.
He told me all those years ago, that we'll only meet again this one time.
On the night I die.
Oh, Billy.
It's kept me going. I'm an old, sick man.
But I've had something to look forward to.
Ah, life is long and you are hot.
Look at my hands.
An old man's hands.
How did that happen?
I'll stay. I'm gonna stay with you, okay?
Thank you, Sally Sparrow.
I have till the rain stops.
(MOBILE RINGING) Bantos. ~SALLY: They're mine.
What?
The DVDs on the list, the 17 DVDs, what they've got in common is me.
They're all the DVDs I own. The Easter egg was intended for me.
You've only got 17 DVDs?
Do you have a portable DVD player?
Of course. Why?
I want you to meet me.
Where?
Wester Drumlins.
I knew you would live in Scooby Doo's house.
For God's sake, I don't live here.
Okay. This is the one with the clearest sound.
Slightly better picture quality on this one, but I don't know...
Doesn't matter.
Okay.
There he is.
The Doctor.
Who's a doctor?
He's the Doctor.
Yup, that's me.
Okay, that was scary.
No, it sounds like he’s replying, but he always says that.
Yes, I do.
And that.
Yup. And this.
He can hear us.
Oh, my God. You can really hear us.
Of course he can't hear us.
Look.
I've got a transcript, see? Everything he says.
"Yup, that's me.” "Yes, I do." "Yup, and this.” Next, it's...
BOTH: Are you gonna read out the whole thing?
Sorry.
Who are you?
I'm a time traveller. Or I was. I'm stuck in 1969.
We're stuck. All of space and time, he promised me.
Now I've got a job in a shop. I've gotta support him!
Martha!
Sorry.
I've seen this bit before.
Quite possibly.
1969, that's where you're talking from? Afraid so.
But you're replying to me.
You can’t know exactly what I'm gonna say 4@ years before I say it.
38.
I'm getting this down. I'm writing in your bits.
How? How is this possible? Tell me.
Not so fast.
People don't understand time. It's not what you think it is.
Then what is it?
Complicated. Tell me.
Very complicated. I'm clever and I'm listening.
And don't patronise me because people have died and I'm not happy. Tell me.
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.
Yeah, I've seen this bit before.
You said that sentence got away from you.
It got away from me, yeah.
Next thing you're gonna say is, “Well, I can hear you." Well, I can hear you.
This is impossible.
No. It's brilliant!
Well, not hear you, exactly, but I know everything you're gonna say.
Always gives me the shivers, that bit.
How can you know what I'm gonna say?
Look to your left.
What's he mean by “look to your left"?
I've written tons about that in the forums, I think it's a political statement.
He means you. What are you doing?
I'm writing in your bits.
That way, I've got a complete transcript of the whole conversation.
Wait until this hits the Net. This will explode the egg forums.
I've got a copy of the finished transcript, it's on my Autocue.
How can you have a copy of the finished transcript?
It's still being written.
I told you, I'm a time traveller. I got it in the future.
Okay, let me get my head round this.
You're reading aloud from a transcript of a conversation you're still having.
Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey...
Actually, never mind that. You can do shorthand?
So?
What matters is we can communicate. We have got big problems now.
They have taken the blue box, haven't they?
The angels have the phone box?
“The angels have the phone box", that's my favourite.
I've got that on a T-shirt.
What do you mean, angels?
You mean those statue things?
Creatures from another world.
But they're just statues.
Only when you see them.
What does that mean?
The Lonely Assassins they used to be called.
No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly, and they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defence system ever evolved.
They are quantum locked.
They don't exist when they're being observed.
The moment they are seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock.
No choice, it's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone.
And you can't kill a stone.
Course, a stone can't kill you, either, but then you turn your head away.
Then you blink.
And, oh, yes, it can.
Don't take your eyes off that.
That's why they cover their eyes, They're not weeping, they can’t risk looking at each other.
Their greatest asset is their greatest curse.
They can never be seen. Loneliest creatures in the universe.
Well, I'm sorry. I am very, very sorry. It's up to you now.
What am I supposed to do?
The blue box. It's my time machine.
There is a world of time energy in there they could feast on forever, but the damage they could do could switch off the sun.
You have got to send it back to me.
How?
How?
And that's it, I'm afraid. There's no more from you on the transcript, that's the last I've got.
I don't know what stopped you talking, but I can guess. They're coming.
The angels are coming for you.
But listen, your life could depend on this.
Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead.
They are fast. Faster than you can believe.
Don't turn your back, don't look away and don’t blink.
Good luck.
No, don't. You can't!
I'll rewind him.
What good will that do?
You're not looking at the statue.
Neither are you.
Keep looking at it. Keep looking at it.
It's just one, right? It's just this one.
We're okay if we just keep staring at this one statue, Everything's gonna be fine. There's three more.
Three?
They were upstairs before, but I think I heard them moving.
Moving? Three of them?
Moving where?
I'm gonna look around. I'm gonna check.
You keep looking at this one. Don't blink.
Remember what he said. Don't even blink.
Who blinked? I'm too scared to blink.
Okay, we're going to the door. Front door.
Okay, we can't both get to the front door without taking our eyes off that thing, so you stay here.
What? I'll be just round the corner.
You stay here.
They've locked it! They've locked us in.
Why? I've got something they want.
What?
The key.
I took it last time I was here. They followed me to get it back.
I led them to the blue box. Now they've got that.
Give them the key.
I'm gonna check the back door. You wait here.
Give them the key! Give them what they want!
Sally, no! What if they come behind me?
Hang on!
(DOOR RATTLING) God.
Oh, God.
It's locked!
Sally! Sally!
It won't open!
Sally, please, I can’t do this!
Sally, hurry up!
Where are you?
Larry, they've blocked up the back door, but there's a cellar.
There might be a way out. Delivery hatch or something.
I'm coming! I can’t stay here.
Okay, boys. We know how this works.
You can't move so long as I can see you.
A whole world in the box, the Doctor says.
I hope he's not lying ‘cause I don't see how else we're getting out.
Oh, and there's your one.
Why is it pointing at the...
light?
Oh, my God, it's turning out the light!
Quickly!
I can't find the lock!
Sally, hurry up!
Get it open!
They're getting faster, Sally! Come on!
It won't turn!
I can't turn it! “Sally! Oh!
Sally, hurry up! Come on!
DOCTOR: This is Security Protocol 712.
This time capsule has detected the presence of an authorised control disc, valid one journey.
Please insert the disc and prepare for departure.
Looks like a DVD player. There's a slot.
They're trying to get in!
Well, hurry up, then!
What's happening?
Oh, my God, it's leaving us behind.
Doctor, don't! You can't!
Doctor!
Look at them! Quick, look at them!
I don't think we need to.
He tricked them. The Doctor tricked them.
They're looking at each other. They're never gonna move again.
Can you mind the shop? I'm just nipping next door for some milk.
Yeah, no worries.
What's this?
Nothing.
Sally.
Can't you let it go?
Of course I can’t let it go.
This is over.
How did the Doctor know where to write those words on the wall?
How could he get a copy of the transcript?
Where did he get all that information from?
Look, some things you never find out and that's okay.
No, it isn't.
Ever think this might be getting in the way of other things?
We just run a shop together.
That's all it is, just a shop.
Anyway. Milk.
Back in a mo.
Right, it's definitely this way.
Okay.
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!
Hello. Sorry, bit of a rush.
There's a sort of thing happening. Very important that we stop it.
Oh, my God, it’s you. It really is you.
Oh, you don't remember me, do you?
Doctor, we haven't got time for this. Migration’s started.
Look, sorry, I've got a bit of a complex life.
Things don’t always happen to me in quite the right order.
Gets a bit confusing at times, especially at weddings.
I'm rubbish at weddings, especially my own.
Oh, my God, of course! You're a time traveller.
It hasn't happened to you yet, none of it. It's still in your future.
What hasn't happened?
Doctor, please! 20 minutes to hatching.
It was me! Oh, for God's sake, it was me all along.
You got it all from me.
Got what?
Okay, listen. One day, you're gonna get stuck in 1969.
Make sure you've got this with you. You're gonna need it.
Doctor!
Yeah! Listen, listen, gotta dash.
Things happening. Well, four things. Well, four things and a lizard.
Okay, no worries. On you go. See you around some day.
What was your name? Sally Sparrow.
Good to meet you, Sally Sparrow.
Goodbye, Doctor.
Don't blink.
Blink and you're dead.
Don't turn your back.
Don't look away.
And don't blink.
Good luck.
We're going to the end of the universe.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(WHOOSHING) DOCTOR: Cardiff!
Cardiff?
Ah, but the thing about Cardiff, it's built on a rift in time and space.
Just like California on the San Andreas Fault, but the rift bleeds energy.
Every now and then I need to open up the engines, soak up the energy, and use it as fuel.
S0 it's a pit stop?
Exactly! Should only take 20 seconds. The rift's been active.
Wait a minute. They had an earthquake in Cardiff a couple of years ago.
Was that you?
Bit of trouble with the Slitheen.
A long time ago. Lifetimes. I was a different man back then.
Doctor!
Finito. All powered up.
What's that?
We're accelerating into the future. The year one billion. Five billion.
Five trillion. Fifty trillion? What?
The year 100 trillion? That's impossible.
Why? What happens then?
We're going to the end of the universe.
Doctor!
Humans. Humans are coming.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) I just want to go. Please let me go.
Human!
Human!
Human!
Human!
A hunt!
Hunt!
(ALL CHANTING) Hunt. Hunt.
(BEEPING) There's movement on the surface. Another human hunt. God help him.
Chan, should I alert the guards, tho?
No, no, we can't spare them. Poor beggar's on his own.
One more lost soul dreaming of Utopia.
Chan, you mustn't talk as though you've given up, tho.
No, no, indeed. Here's to it. Utopia.
Well, it is to be hoped the coffee is a little less sour. Will you join me?
Chan, I am happy drinking my own internal milk, tho.
Yes, well. That's quite enough information, thank you.
OVER PA: Professor Yana. Don't want to rush you, but how are we doing?
(STUTTERING) Yes, yes, working. Yes, almost there.
How's it looking on the Footprint?
It's good. Yes, fine, excellent.
Chan, there's no problem as such.
We've accelerated the calculation matrix, but it's going to take time to harmonise, tho.
Chan, we're trying a new reversal process.
We'll have a definite result in approximately two hours, tho.
(DRUMS BEATING) (DISTANT) Chan, Professor, tho?
Chan, Professor Yana, tho?
Chan, Professor, tho.
Yes, yes, yes, working.
Chan, it's the surface scanner, Professor.
It seems to be detecting a different signal, tho.
Well, that's not a standard reading. I can't make it out.
It would seem something new has arrived.
Well, we've landed.
So what's out there?
I don't know.
Say that again. That's rare.
Not even the Time Lords came this far.
We should leave. We should go.
We should really, really go.
Oh, my God.
Can't get a pulse. Hold on, you've got that medical kit thing.
Hello again. Oh, I'm sorry.
Here we go. Get out of the way.
It's a bit odd, though, not very 100 trillion.
That coat's more like World War II.
I think he came with us.
How do you mean? From Earth?
Must've been clinging to the outside of the Tardis.
All the way through the vortex. Well, that’s very him.
What, do you know him?
Friend of mine.
Used to travel with me. Back in the old days.
But he's... I'm sorry, there's no heartbeat. There's nothing. He's dead.
Oh, so much for me. It's all right, just breathe deep. I've got you.
Captain Jack Harkness. And who are you?
Martha Jones.
Nice to meet you, Martha Jones.
Oh, don't start.
I was only saying hello.
I don't mind.
Doctor. ~Captain.
~Good to see you.
And you.
Same as ever. Although, have you had work done?
You can talk.
Oh, yes, the face. Regeneration.
How did you know this was me?
The police box kind of gives it away.
I've been following you for a long time. You abandoned me.
Did I? Busy life. Moving on.
Just got to ask. The Battle of Canary Wharf.
I saw the list of the dead. It said Rose Tyler.
Oh, no, sorry. She's alive.
You're kidding!
Parallel world, safe and sound. And Mickey. And her mother.
Oh, yes!
Good old Rose.
So there I was, stranded in the year 200100, ankle-deep in Dalek dust, and he goes off without me, but I had this.
I used to be a Time Agent. It's called a vortex manipulator.
He's not the only one who can time travel.
Excuse me, that is not time travel.
It's like, I've got a sports car, you've got a space hopper.
Oh, boys and their toys!
All right, so I bounced.
I thought, "21st century, the best place to find the Doctor.” Except I got it a little wrong, arrived in 1869, this thing burnt out, so it was useless.
Told you.
Thad to live through the entire 20th century waiting for a version of you that would coincide with me.
But that makes you more than 100 years old.
And looking good, don’t you think?
So, I went to the time rift, based myself there, ‘cause I knew you'd come back to refuel, until finally, I get a signal on this detecting you and here we are.
But the thing is, how come you left him behind, Doctor?
I was busy.
Is that what happens, though, seriously?
Do you just get bored of us one day and disappear?
Not if you're blonde.
Oh, she was blonde! What a surprise!
You two, we're at the end of the universe, right?
Right at the edge of knowledge itself and you're busy...
blogging!
Come on.
Is that a city?
City or a hive or a nest. Or a conglomeration.
Like it was grown. But look, there, that's like pathways or roads.
There must've been some sort of life.
Long ago.
What killed it?
Time. Just time. Everything's dying now. All the great civilisations have gone.
This isn't just night. All the stars have burnt up and faded away into nothing.
They must have an atmospheric shell. We should be frozen to death.
Well, Martha and I, maybe. Not so sure about you, Jack.
But what about the people? Does no one survive?
I suppose we have to hope life will find a way.
Well, he's not doing too bad.
(ALL YELLING) Is it me or does that look like a hunt? Come on!
Oh, I've missed this!
I've got you. I've got you...
We've got to run. They're coming!
Jack, don't you dare!
What the hell are they?
There's more of them. We've got to keep going.
I've got a ship nearby. It's safe. It's not far. It's over there, Or maybe not.
We're close to the silo.
If we get to the silo, then we're safe. Silo?
Silo.
Silo for me.
It's the Futurekind, they're coming! Open the gate!
Show me your teeth!
Show me your teeth! Show me your teeth!
Show him your teeth!
Human! Let them in! Let them in!
Close!
Close!
Close!
Humans. Humani.
Make feast.
Go back to where you came from.
I said go back! Back!
Oh, don't tell him to put his gun down.
He's not my responsibility.
And I am? That makes a change.
Kind want you.
(GRUNTS) Kind hungry.
(SHOUTS) Thanks for that.
Right, let's get you inside.
My name is Padra Fet Shafe Cane. Tell me, just tell me.
~Can you take me to Utopia?
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, I can.
Professor, we've got four new humans inside.
One of them is calling himself a doctor.
Of medicine?
He says of everything.
What? A scientist! Oh, my word!
(STUTTERING) Chantho, just... I don't know. I'm coming!
DOCTOR: It's like a box, a big blue box.
I'm sorry, but I really need it back. It's stuck out there.
I'm sorry, but my family were heading for the silo. Did they get here?
My mother is Kistane Shafe Cane. My brother's name is Beltone.
Computers are down, but you can check the paperwork. Creet!
Passenger needs help.
Right, what do you need?
A blue box, you said?
Big, tall, wooden, says “Police”.
We're driving out for the last water collection. I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
Come on.
Sorry, but how old are you?
Old enough to work. This way.
CREET: Kistane Shafe Cane.
Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane.
I'm looking for a Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane.
PADRA: The Shafe Canes, anyone? CREET: Anyone?
Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane.
Anyone know the Shafe Cane family? Anyone called Shafe Cane?
It's like a refugee camp.
It's stinking. Sorry. No offence. Not you.
Don't you see, though? The ripe old smell of humans. You survived.
Oh, you might've spent a million years evolving into clouds of gas and another million as downloads, but you always revert to the same basic shape.
The fundamental human.
CREET: Kistane Shafe Cane.
End of the universe and here you are. Indomitable, that's the word!
Indomitable!
Is there a Kistane Shafe Cane?
That's me.
Mother!
KISTANE: Oh, my God. Padra!
It's not all bad news.
~Captain Jack Harkness. And who are you?
Stop it. Give us a hand with this.
It's half-deadlocked. See if you can overwrite the code.
Let's find out where we are.
JACK: I've got you. DOCTOR: Thanks.
How did you cope without me?
Now that is what I call a rocket.
DOCTOR: They're not refugees, they're passengers.
He said they were going to Utopia.
The perfect place. 100 trillion years and it's the same old dream.
DOCTOR: Do you recognise those engines?
Nope, whatever it is, it's not rocket science. But it’s hot, though.
Boiling.
But if the universe is falling apart, what does Utopia mean?
The Doctor? “That's me.
Good! Good! Good!
Good, good, good. Good!
It's good, apparently.
Chan, welcome, tho.
This is the gravitissimal accelerator. It's past its best, but it works.
Chan, welcome, tho.
And over here is the Footprint Impeller System.
Do you know anything about end-time gravity mechanics?
Hello. Who are you?
Chan, Chantho, tho.
But we can’t get it to harmonise.
~Captain Jack Harkness.
Stop it.
Can't I say hello to anyone?
Chan, I do not protest, tho.
Maybe later, blue. So what have we got here?
And all this feeds into the rocket?
Yes, except without a stable Footprint, we'll never achieve escape velocity.
If only we could harmonise the five impact patterns and unify them, well, we might yet make it.
What do you think, Doctor? Any ideas?
Well, basically, sort of, not a clue.
Nothing?
I'm not from round these parts. I've never seen a system like it.
Sorry.
No, no, I'm sorry. It's my fault.
There's been so little help...
Oh, my God.
You've got a hand.
A hand in ajar. A hand, in a jar, in your bag.
(STUTTERING) That's my hand.
I said I had a Doctor detector.
Chan, is this is a tradition amongst your people, tho?
Not on my street! What do you mean, that's your hand?
You've got both your hands, I can see them.
Long story. I lost my hand, Christmas Day in a swordfight.
What, and you grew another hand?
Yeah, yeah I did, yeah. Hello.
Might I ask, what species are you?
Time Lord. Last of. Heard of them? Legend or anything?
Not even a myth? Blimey, end of the universe is a bit humbling.
Chan, it is said that I am the last of my species too, tho.
Sorry. What was your name?
My assistant and good friend, Chantho.
A survivor of the Malmooth. This was their planet, Malcassairo, before we took refuge.
The city outside. That was yours?
Chan, the conglomeration died, tho.
Conglomeration! That's what I said!
You're supposed to say sorry.
Oh, yes.
Sorry. ~Chan, most grateful, tho.
You grew another hand?
Hello again. It's fine. Look, really, it's me.
All this time and you're still full of surprises.
Chan, you are most unusual, tho.
Well...
So what about those things outside, the Beastie Boys? What are they?
We call them the Futurekind, which is a myth in itself, but it's feared they are what we will become.
Unless we reach Utopia.
And Utopia is...?
Every human knows of Utopia. Where have you been?
Bit of a hermit.
A hermit with friends?
Hermits United.
We meet up every 10 years, swap stories about caves. It's good fun.
For a hermit. So, Utopia?
The call came from across the stars. Over and over again.
“Come to Utopia." Originating from that point.
Where is that?
Oh, it's far beyond the Condensate Wilderness.
Out towards the Wildlands and the Dark Matter Reefs, Calling us in, the last of the humans scattered across the night.
DOCTOR: What do you think is out there? YANA: We can't know.
A colony, a city, some sort of haven.
The Science Foundation created the Utopia Project thousands of years ago to preserve mankind, to find a way of surviving beyond the collapse of reality itself.
Now, perhaps they found it.
Perhaps not. But it's worth a look, don’t you think?
Oh, yes.
(DRUMS BEATING) And the signal keeps modulating 50 it's not on automatic.
That's a good sign. Someone's out there.
(DISTANT) And that's a navigation matrix, isn’t it?
So you can fly without the stars to guide you, Professor?
Professor? Professor?
Professor!
L.. Right, that's enough talk. There's work to do.
Now if you could leave, thank you.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine. And busy.
Except that rocket's not going to fly, is it?
This Footprint mechanism thing, it's not working.
We'll find a way!
You're stuck on this planet.
And you haven't told them, have you?
That lot out there, they still think they're gonna fly.
Well, it's better to let them live in hope.
Quite right, too. And I must say, Professor... What was it?
Yana.
Professor Yana, this new science is well beyond me.
But all the same, a boost reversal circuit, in any timeframe, must be a circuit which reverses the boost.
So I wonder what would happen if I did... this.
Chan, it's working, tho!
But how did you do that?
Oh, we've been chatting away. I forgot to tell you, I'm brilliant.
All passengers, prepare for boarding.
Repeat, all passengers prepare for immediate boarding.
Destination, Utopia.
In there.
Inside! Everyone, inside!
Come on, move, move, move!
All passengers prepare for immediate boarding.
All passengers prepare for immediate boarding.
Excuse me.
Hey, what was your name? Creet? That's right, miss.
Who are you with, Creet? You got family?
No, miss. There's just me.
Well, good luck. What do you think it's gonna be like in Utopia?
My mum used to say the skies were made of diamonds, Good for her. Go on, off you go, get your seat.
(SNARLING) Is that...
Gluten extract.
It binds the neutralino map together.
But that's food.
You've built this system out of food and string and staples?
Professor Yana, you're a genius. ~Says the man who made it work.
Oh, it's easy coming in at the end. But you're stellar.
This is magnificent. And I don’t often say that ‘cause...
Well, ‘cause of me.
Well, even my title is an affectation.
There hasn't been such a thing as a university for over 1,000 years.
I've spent my life going from one refugee ship to another.
If you'd been born in a different time, you'd be revered. I mean it.
Throughout the galaxies.
Oh, those damn galaxies, they had to go and collapse.
Some admiration would have been nice. Yes, just a little. Just once.
Well, you've got it now.
But that Footprint engine thing...
You can’t activate it from on-board. It's got to be done from here.
You're staying behind.
With Chantho. She won't leave without me. Simply refuses.
You'd give your life so they could fly.
Oh, I think I'm a little too old for Utopia. Time I had some sleep.
Professor, tell the Doctor we've found his blue box.
Ah.
Doctor?
Professor, it's a wild stab in the dark, but I might just have found you a way out.
Extra power.
Little bit of a cheat, but who's counting?
Jack, you're in charge of the retro feeds.
Oh, am I glad to see that thing.
Chan, Professor, are you all right, tho?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just get on with it.
Connect those circuits into the spar, same as the last lot.
But quicker.
MARTHA: Yes, sir.
You don't have to keep working. We can handle it.
It's just a headache, just noise inside my head, Doctor.
Constant noise inside my head.
What sort of noise?
The sound of drums, More and more, as though it's getting closer.
When did it start? I've had it all my life.
Every waking hour.
Still, no rest for the wicked.
So how long have you been with the Professor?
Chan, 17 years, tho.
Blimey. Long time.
Chan, I adore him, tho.
Oh, right. And he...
Chan, I don't think he even notices, tho.
Tell me about it.
Chan, but I am happy to serve, tho.
Do you mind if I ask? Do you have to start every sentence with “Chan"?
Chan, yes, tho.
And end every sentence with...
Chan, tho, tho.
What would happen if you didn't?
Chan, that would be rude, tho.
What, like swearing?
Chan, indeed, tho.
Go on. Just once, Chan, I can't, tho.
Do it for me.
No.
(GIGGLING) Professor. Systems are down.
Professor, are you getting me?
I'm here! We're ready.
Now all you need to do is connect the couplings, then we can launch.
Save us, this equipment!
Needs rebooting all the time.
Anything I can do?
I've finished that lot.
Yes, if you could.
Just press the reboot key every time the picture goes.
Certainly, sir. Just don't ask me to do shorthand.
Are you still there?
Present and correct.
Send your man inside. We'll keep the levels down from here.
He's inside, Captain, keep the dials below the red.
Where is that room?
It's underneath the rocket.
Fix the couplings and the Footprint can work.
But the entire chamber is flooded with stet radiation.
Stet? Never heard of it.
You wouldn't want to. But it's safe enough if we can hold the radiation back from here.
(ALARM BEEPING) It's rising. 0.2.
Keep it level.
Yes, sir.
(ALARM BUZZING) We're losing power, tho.
DOCTOR: Radiation's rising.
We've Lost control!
The chamber's going to flood!
Jack! Override the vents!
Get out! Get out of there!
Jate!
GUARD: Hey, you!
Stop!
(MACHINE GUNS FIRING) We can jump-start the override.
Don't. It's gonna flare!
(SCREAMING) Jate, get out of there! Get out!
No!
I've got him.
Chan, don't touch the cables, tho.
I'm so sorry.
The chamber's flooded with radiation, yes?
Without the couplings, the engines will never start.
It was all for nothing.
Oh, I don't know.
Martha, leave him.
You've got to let me try.
Come on, come on, just listen to me. Now leave him alone.
Strikes me, Professor, you've got a room which no man can enter without dying.
Is that correct?
Yes.
Well...
(GASPING) I think I've got just the man.
Was someone kissing me?
Lieutenant, get on-board the rocket. I promise you're going to fly.
The chamber's flooded.
Trust me, we found a way of tripping the system. Run!
What are you taking your clothes off for?
I'm going in.
By the looks of it, I'd say that stet radiation doesn't affect clothing, only flesh.
Well, I look good, though.
How long have you known?
Ever since I ran away from you.
Good luck.
MARTHA: We lost picture when that thing flared up.
Doctor, are you there?
Receiving, yeah, He's inside.
And still alive?
Oh, yes.
But he should evaporate. What sort of a man is he?
I've only just met him.
The Doctor sort of travels through time and space and picks people up.
God, I make us sound like stray dogs. Maybe we are.
He travels in time?
Don't ask me to explain it.
That's a Tardis, that box thing. The sports car of time travel, he says.
(DRUMS BEATING) VOICE: Inside the box, inside the box...
When did you realise?
Earth, 1892.
Got in a fight on Ellis Island, a man shot me through the heart.
And then I woke up. Thought it was kind of strange.
But then it never stopped. Fell off a cliff, trampled by horses, World War I, World War II. Poison, starvation, a stray javelin.
Ooh!
In the end, I got the message. I'm the man who can never die, And all that time you knew.
That's why I left you behind.
It's not easy, even just looking at you, Jack, ~‘cause you're wrong.
Thanks.
You are. I can't help it.
I'm a Time Lord. It's instinct. It's in my guts.
You're a fixed point in time and space. You're a fact.
That's never meant to happen.
Even the Tardis reacted against you, tried to shake you off.
Flew all the way to the end of the universe just to get rid of you.
So what you're saying is you're prejudiced?
I never thought of it like that.
Shame on you.
Yeah.
JACK: Last thing I remember, back when I was mortal, I was facing three Daleks, death by extermination.
VOICE: Daleks... Daleks... JACK: Then I came back to life.
What happened?
Rose.
JACK: I thought you'd sent her back home.
DOCTOR: She came back.
Opened the heart of the Tardis and absorbed the time vortex itself.
JACK: What does that mean exactly?
DOCTOR: No one’s ever meant to have that power.
If a Time Lord did that, he'd become a god, a vengeful god.
But she was human.
I bring life.
Everything she did was so human.
She brought you back to life.
But she couldn't control it. She brought you back forever.
That's something, I suppose. The final act of the Time War was life.
JACK: Do you think she could change me back?
DOCTOR: I took the power out of her.
She's gone, Jack.
She's not just living on a parallel world, she's trapped there.
The walls have closed.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I went back to her estate in the '9@s, just once or twice.
Watched her growing up.
Never said hello, timelines and all that.
Do you want to die?
This one's a little stuck.
Jack?
I thought I did. I don't know.
But this lot, you see them out here surviving and that's fantastic.
You might be out there somewhere.
I could go meet myself.
Well, it's the only man you're ever gonna be happy with.
This new regeneration, it's kinda cheeky.
VOICE: Regeneration. Regeneration.
I never understand half the things he's saying.
What's wrong?
Chan, Professor, what is it, tho?
Time travel.
They say there was time travel back in the old days.
I never believed.
But what would I know? Stupid old man.
Never could keep time. Always late, always lost.
Even this thing never worked.
Martha, this watch is me. I'm gonna become human.
Time and time and time again, always running out on me.
Can I have a look at that?
It's only an old relic. Like me!
Where did you get it?
Hmm?
I was found with it.
What do you mean?
An orphan in the storm.
I was a naked child found on the coast of the Silver Devastation.
Abandoned. With only this.
Have you ever opened it?
Why would I? It's broken.
How do you know it's broken if you've never opened it?
It's stuck, it's old, it's not meant to be.
I don't know.
Does it matter?
No, it's nothing. It's...
Listen, everything's fine up here. I'm gonna see if the Doctor needs me.
Yes!
Now, get out of there, come on!
Lieutenant, everyone on board?
Ready and waiting.
Stand by! Two minutes to ignition.
ATILLO: Ready to launch, Outer doors sealed. launching in T minus 99, 98...
Ah, nearly there. The Footprint, it's a gravity pulse.
It stamps down, the rocket shoots up.
Bit primitive. Gonna take the both of us to keep it stable.
(BEEPING) Doctor, it's the Professor. He's got this watch, he's got a fob watch.
It's the same as yours, same writing on it, same everything.
Don't be ridiculous.
l asked him.
He said he's had it his whole life.
So he's got the same watch.
Yeah, but it's not a watch. It's this chameleon thing.
No, no, no, it's this thing... This device, it rewrites biology.
Changes a Time Lord into a human.
And it's the same watch!
It can't be, That means he could be a Time Lord.
You might not be the last one!
Jack, keep it level!
But that's brilliant, isn’t it?
Yes, it is. Of course it is.
Depends which one. Brilliant, fantastic, yeah. But they died, the Time Lords.
All of them, they died.
Not if he was human.
What did he say, Martha? What did he say?
He looked at the watch like he could hardly see it.
Like that perception filter thing.
What about now? Can he see it now?
DOCTOR: The Tardis. The time vortex.
VOICE: Regeneration.
It's the drums, the drums, the drums, the never-ending drumbeat.
Open me, you human fool. Open the light and summon me and receive my majesty.
Destroy him. Then you will give your power to me.
Chan, Yana, won't you please take some rest, tho?
ATILLO: 77, 70, 9...
If he escaped the Time War, then it's a perfect place to hide.
The end of the universe.
Think what the Face of Boe said. His dying words.
He said...
(RUMBLING) You are not alone.
Chan, Professor Yana, tho?
Lieutenant, have you done it? Did you get velocity?
Have you done it? Lieutenant, have you done it?
ATILLO: Affirmative. We'll see you in Utopia.
Good luck.
~Chan, but you've locked them in, tho.
Door open.
Door open!
Not to worry, my dear. As one door closes, another must open.
(SNARLING) Chan, you must stop, tho.
Chan, but you've lowered the defences. The Futurekind will get in, tho.
Chan, Professor, I'm so sorry, but I must stop you.
You are destroying all our work, tho.
Oh! Now I can say I was provoked.
Did you never think, all those years standing beside me, to ask about that watch? Never?
Did you never once think, not ever, that you could set me free?
Chan, I'm sorry, tho.
Chan, I'm so sorry.
And you, with your "Chan" and your "tho", driving me insane.
Chan, Professor, please.
That is not my name!
The professor was an invention.
So perfect a disguise that I forgot who I am.
Chan, then who are you, tho?
Tam the Master.
This way!
Professor!
Professor, let me in! Let me in!
Jack, get the door open, now!
Professor, Professor, where are you?
Chantho, Chantho, are you there?
Please, I need to explain. Whatever you do, don't open that watch.
Utopia.
Hurry!
Open the door! Open the door, please.
I am begging you, Professor. Please listen to me.
Just open the door, please.
And locked.
Let me in. Let me in!
She's dead.
I broke the lock. Give me a hand.
I'm begging you. Everything's changed.
It's only the two of us. We're the only ones left.
Just let me in!
Killed by an insect.
A girl.
How inappropriate.
But still, if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can I.
The Master, reborn.
(SCREAMING) Doctor, you'd better think of something!
(LAUGHING) Now then, Doctor.
Oh, new voice.
Hello. Hello.
Hello.
Anyway, why don't we stop and have a nice little chat while I tell you all my plans and you can work out a way to stop me?
I don’t think!
Hold on, I know that voice.
(SCREAMING) I'm asking you, really properly, just stop, just think.
Use my name.
Master.
I'm sorry.
Tough!
JACK: I can't hold them much longer, Doctor!
No, you don't.
End of the universe. Have fun. Bye-bye.
Doctor, stop him!
(WHOOSHING) Hurry up, they're getting in!
Let the work of Government begin.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(ALL GROANING) Oh, my head!
Time travel without a capsule, that's a killer.
Still, at least we made it.
Earth, 21st century by the looks of it.
JACK: Talk about lucky.
That wasn't luck. That was me.
Hold it still! Don't move, hold it still...
I'm telling you, it's broken, it hasn't worked for years...
That's because you didn’t have me! Martha, grab hold.
Now!
The moral is, if you're gonna get stuck at the end of the universe, get stuck with an ex-Time Agent and his vortex manipulator.
But this Master bloke, he's got the Tardis.
He could be anywhere in time and space.
No. He's here. Trust me.
Who is he anyway?
And that voice at the end, that wasn't the Professor.
If the Master's a Time Lord, then he must've regenerated.
What does that mean?
It means he's changed his face.
Voice, body, everything, new man.
(TAPPING) Then how are we gonna find him?
I'll know him. The moment I see him.
Time Lords always do.
But hold on, if he could be anyone...
We missed the election. But it can't be...
NEWSCASTER: Mr Saxon has returned from the Palace, and is greeting the crowds inside Saxon Headquarters.
MARTHA: I said I knew that voice.
When he spoke, inside the Tardis, I've heard that voice hundreds of times. I've seen him, we all have.
That was the voice of Harold Saxon.
That's him. He's Prime Minister.
The Master is Prime Minister of Great Britain.
The Master and his wife?
This country has been sick.
This country needs healing.
This country needs medicine.
In fact, I'd go so far as to say, that what this country really needs right now is a Doctor.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Finance report, sir.
Military protocol, sir.
EC directive, sir.
Annual budget, sir.
Policy recommendations.
I'm so proud of you, Harry.
Bless.
Sir, if you don't mind me asking.
I'm sorry, but it's all a bit new, what exactly do you want me to do?
Oh, yes, what was it... Tish, Letitia Jones.
Tish.
Well then, Tish.
You just stand there and look gorgeous.
A glorious day. Downing Street rebuilt.
The Cabinet in session.
Let the work of government begin.
Oh, go on, crack a smile. It's funny, isn't it?
Albert? Funny? No? Little bit?
Very funny, sir.
But if we could get down to business, there is the matter of policy, of which we have very little...
No, no, no, no.
Before we start all that, I just want to say...
Thank you. Thank you one and all.
You ugly fat-faced bunch of wet, snivelling traitors.
Yes, quite, very funny, but I...
No, no, that wasn't funny.
You see, I'm not making myself very clear, funny is like this...
Not funny is like this...
And right now, I'm not like... I'm like...
Because you are traitors. Yes, you are!
As soon as you saw the vote swinging my way, you abandoned your parties and you jumped on the Saxon bandwagon. So...
This is your reward.
Excuse me, Prime Minister, do you mind my asking, what is that?
(MUFFLED) A gas mask.
I beg your pardon?
It's a gas mask.
Yes, but why are you wearing it?
(MUFFLED) Oh, because of the gas.
I'm sorry?
Because of the gas.
What gas?
(MUFFLED) This gas.
You're insane.
Home!
What you got? Computer, laptop, anything.
Who are you phoning? You can’t tell anyone we're here!
Just some friends of mine but there's no reply.
Here you go. Any good?
I'll show you the Saxon websites, he's been around for ages.
That's so weird, ‘cause the day after the election, that's only four days after I met you.
We went flying all round the universe while he was here all the time.
You gonna tell us who he is?
He's a Time Lord.
What about the rest of it? I mean, who'd call himself "the Master"?
That's all you need to know. Come on, show me Harold Saxon.
TISH: Martha, where are you? I've got this new job!
You won't believe it, it's weird. They phoned me up out of the blue...
Oh, like it matters!
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed in...
"Harold Saxon, a modern Churchill.” It's the definitive think-piece on the great man himself.
Come on, sweetheart, you must've read it!
Um, not really. Sorry, I'm new.
Mr Saxon does like a pretty face. But I'm here to see Mrs Saxon.
You can’t just go barging in...
Mrs Saxon, Vivien Rook, Sunday Mirror. You've heard of me.
Can't I just have an hour to myself? It's been a hell of a day.
Strike while the iron's hot, that's what I say, Lucy...
I can call you Lucy, can’t 1?
Now, everyone's talking about Harold Saxon, but I thought, what about the wife? All I need is 20 minutes.
Oh, I think maybe we should wait...
The headline's waiting to print, "The Power Behind The Throne”.
Really?
Britain's First Lady.
Gosh.
Front page.
Oh! Well...
I suppose... Oh, go on then, 20 minutes.
Excellent!
Thank you. Go, go... What was it... Tish?
Now you can leave us alone.
No, but I'm supposed to sit in.
No, no. It's only a profile piece.
You know, hair and clothes and nonsense. There's a good girl, out you go.
That's it.
Mrs Saxon, I have reason to believe that you're in very great danger. All of us, in fact.
Not just the country, but the whole world.
No, I beg of you. Hear me out.
What are you talking about?
Your husband is not who he says he is.
I'm sorry, but it’s a lie. Everything's a lie.
(MUSIC PLAYING) I'm voting Saxon. He can tick my box any day!
ALL: Vote Saxon! Go Harry!
I think Mr Saxon is exactly what this country needs.
He's a very fine man. And he’s handsome, too.
Former Minister of Defence, first came to prominence when he shot down the Racnoss on Christmas Eve.
Nice work by the way.
Oh, thanks.
But he goes back years, he’s famous, everyone knows the story. Look.
Cambridge University, rugby Blue, won the athletics thing, wrote a novel, went into business, marriage, everything.
He's got a whole life.
All of it, the school days, his degree, even his mother and father, it's all invented.
Look, Harold Saxon never went to Cambridge, there was no Harold Saxon!
The thing is, it's obvious.
The forgery is screaming out and yet no one can see it!
It's as if he's mesmerised the entire world.
I think perhaps you should leave now.
Eighteen months ago he became real.
This is his first honest-to-God appearance, just after the downfall of Harriet Jones.
And at the exact same time, they launched the Archangel Network.
Mrs Rook, now stop it!
Even now, they've said that the Cabinet's gone into seclusion.
What does that mean, seclusion?
How should I know?
But I've got plenty of research on you.
Yes, good family, Roedean, not especially bright, but essentially harmless, and that's why I'm asking you.
Lucy, I am begging you, if you have seen anything, heard anything, even the slightest thing that would give you cause to doubt him...
I think...
Yes?
There was a time, when we first met, I wondered...
But he was so good to my father, and he said...
What? Just tell me, sweetheart.
The thing is...
I made my choice.
I'm sorry?
For better or for worse.
Isn't that right, Harry?
My faithful companion.
Mr Saxon.
Prime Minister. I was just having a little joke with...
Poor little Lucy, I didn't mean...
Oh, but you're absolutely right.
Harold Saxon doesn't exist.
Then tell me...
who are you?
I am the Master.
And these are my friends.
I'm sorry.
Can't you hear it, Mrs Rook?
What do you mean?
The drumbeat.
The drums are coming closer and closer.
SPHERE 1: The lady doesn't like us.
No...
SPHERE 2: Silly lady.
“No... ~SPHERE 2: Dead lady.
(SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) But she knew!
Harry, she knew everything. You promised.
You said Archangel was one hundred per cent.
Um. Ninety nine. Ninety eight?
But if she's asking questions, then who else?
How much time have we got?
Tomorrow morning, I promise.
That's when everything ends.
But he's got the Tardis.
Maybe the Master went back in time, and has been living here for decades.
“No.
Why not? Worked for me.
When he was stealing the Tardis the only thing I could do was fuse the coordinates.
I locked them permanently.
He can only travel between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis landed. Which is right here, right now.
Yeah, but a little leeway?
Well, 18 months, tops. The most he could have been here is 18 months.
So how's he managed all this?
The Master was always sort of hypnotic, but this is on a massive scale.
I was gonna vote for him.
Really?
Well, it was before I even met you. And I liked him.
Me, too.
Why do you say that?
What was his policy, what did he stand for?
I don't know, he always sounded good.
Like you could trust him.
Just nice. He spoke about...
I can't really remember, but it was good.
Just the sound of his voice.
What's that?
What?
That! That tapping, that rhythm.
What are you doing?
I don't know, it's nothing...
I don't know!
Our Lord and Master is speaking to his kingdom.
Britain, Britain, Britain.
What extraordinary times we've had.
Just a few years ago, this world was so small.
And then they came.
Out of the unknown. Falling from the skies.
You've seen it happen. Big Ben destroyed.
A spaceship over London.
All those ghosts and metal men, the Christmas Star that came to kill.
Time and time again and the government told you nothing.
Well, not me. Not Harold Saxon.
Because my purpose here today is to tell you this.
Citizens of Great Britain...
I have been contacted.
A message for humanity from beyond the stars.
SPHERE: People of the Earth.
We come in peace. We bring you great gifts.
We bring technology and wisdom and protection.
And all we ask in return is your friendship.
Oh, sweet.
And this species has identified itself.
They're called the Toclafane.
What?
And tomorrow morning they will appear, not in secret, but to all of you.
Diplomatic relations with a new species will begin.
Tomorrow, we take our place in the universe.
Every man, woman and child, every teacher and chemist and lorry driver and farmer and, oh, I don't know, every...
medical student?
DOCTOR: Out!
(BEEPING) ~All right? Martha?
Fine, yeah, I'm fine.
What are you doing?
He knows about me, what about my family?
Don't tell them anything.
I'll do what I like!
Mum! Oh, my God, you're there.
Course I'm here, sweetheart.
You all right?
I'm fine, no, I'm fine.
Mum, has there been anyone asking about me?
Martha, I think perhaps you should come round.
I can't, not now.
No, but it's your father.
We've been talking, and we thought we might give it another go.
Don't be so daft! Since when?
Just come round.
Come to the house. We can celebrate, You'd never get back with him in a million years.
Ask him yourself.
Martha, it's me.
Dad? What are you doing there?
Like your mother said. Come round, we can explain everything.
Dad, just say yes or no.
Is there someone else there?
Yes, Just run! Listen to me, just run!
Clive, stop it!
I don't know who they are!
You stupid man!
We're trying to help her!
Dad, what's going?
We've got to get Martha away from him! I've gotta help them.
That's exactly what they want, it's a trap!
I don't care!
Get off!
It is your fault! All of you!
You voted Saxon! You did this!
Corner!
Mr Saxon, we have Condition Red on the Jones Plan, we're taking them in.
All of them.
But I was helping you!
(PHONE RINGING) Come on, Tish, pick up.
(RINGING) Martha, can’t talk now! We've just made First Contact, did you see?
What are you doing! Get off!
Linda, tell them!
What's happening? Tish?
It's your fault! It's all your fault!
I was helping you! Get off me!
Martha! Get out of here, get out!
Target identified!
Martha, reverse!
Take aim!
Get out now!
Fire!
Move it!
Take them away!
The only place he can go was planet Earth!
Careful!
Martha, listen to me, do as I say.
We gotta ditch this car. Pull over. Right now!
Martha, come on.
Leo!
Oh, thank God, Leo, you've gotta listen to me. Where are you?
I'm in Brighton. Yeah, we came down with Boxer.
Did you see that Saxon thing on telly?
Leo, just listen to me, don't go home.
I'm telling you, don't phone Mum or Dad or Tish, you've gotta hide.
~Shut up.
On my life, you've gotta trust me.
Go to Boxer's, stay with him, don't tell anyone, just hide.
Ooh, nice little game of hide and seek, I love that!
But I'll find you, Martha Jones.
Been a long time since we saw each other.
Must be, what, a hundred trillion years?
Let them go, Saxon!
Do you hear me? Let them go!
I'm here.
Doctor.
Master.
(SIGHS) I like it when you use my name.
You chose it. Psychiatrist's field day.
As you chose yours. The man who makes people better.
How sanctimonious is that?
So, Prime Minister, then?
I know! It's good, isn't it?
Who are those creatures? There's no such thing as the Toclafane.
That's just a made-up name, like the bogeyman.
Do you remember all those fairy tales about the Toclafane when we were kids?
Back home?
Where is it, Doctor?
Gone.
How can Gallifrey be gone?
It burnt.
And the Time Lords?
Dead.
And the Daleks. More or less.
What happened to you?
The Time Lords only resurrected me because they knew I'd be the perfect warrior for a Time War.
I was there when the Dalek Emperor took control of the Cruciform.
I saw it.
Tran.
Iran so far.
Made myself human so they would never find me, because...
I was so scared.
I know.
All of them? But not you.
Which must mean...
I was the only one who could end it.
And I tried, I did, I tried everything.
What did it feel like, though?
Two almighty civilisations burning.
Oh, tell me, how did that feel?
Stop it.
You must have been like God.
I've been alone ever since.
But not any more. Don't you see, all we've got is each other?
Are you asking me out on a date?
You could stop this right now, we could leave this planet.
We can fight across the constellations if that's what you want.
But not on Earth.
Too late.
Why do you say that?
The drumming.
Can't you hear it?
I thought it would stop, but it never does.
It never, ever stops. Inside my head.
The drumming, Doctor, the constant drumming.
I can help you. Please let me help.
It's everywhere. Listen, listen, listen.
(TAPPING) Here come the drums.
Here come the drums.
What have you done?
Tell me how you've done this. What are those creatures? Tell me!
Ooh, look, you're on TV!
Stop it. Answer me.
No, really, you're on telly!
You and your little band.
Which, by the way, is ticking every demographic box.
So congratulations on that. Look, there you are!
NEWSCASTER: They are known to be armed and extremely dangerous.
You're public enemies number one, two and three!
Oh, and you can tell handsome Jack that I've sent his little gang off on a wild goose chase to the Himalayas so he won't be getting any help from them.
Now go on, off you go. Why not start by turning to the... right?
He can see us.
Ooh, you public menace.
Better start running! Go on, run!
He's got control of everything.
What do we do?
We've got nowhere to go.
Doctor, what do we do?
Run, Doctor!
Run for your life!
We run.
I said, run!
Tomorrow morning, Britain will be welcoming an extraterrestrial species...
The President is said to be furious that Great Britain's taken unilateral action...
(SPEAKING MANDARIN) Have you seen these things?
This planet's amazing.
Television in their stomach. Now that is evolution!
[s the machine ready?
Tomorrow morning.
It reaches critical at 8:02 precisely.
We have to escape because it's coming, sir, the darkness.
The never-ending darkness, and the terrible, terrible cold.
We have to run and run and run.
8:00, tomorrow morning.
Tell your people the world is waiting.
JACK: How was it?
I don't think anyone saw me. Anything new?
I got this tuned into the government wavelength ~so we can follow what Saxon's doing.
I meant about my family.
Still says the Jones family taken in for questioning.
Tell you what, though, no mention of Leo, He's not as daft as he looks.
I'm talking about my brother, on the run, how did this happen?
Nice chips.
Actually, they're not bad.
So, Doctor, who is he?
How come the ancient society of Time Lords created a psychopath?
And what is he to you?
Like a colleague, or...
A friend at first.
Thought you were gonna say he was your secret brother or something.
You've been watching too much TV.
But all the legends of Gallifrey made it sound so perfect.
Well, perfect to look at, maybe. And it was, it was beautiful.
They used to call it the Shining World of the Seven Systems.
And on the continent of Wild Endeavour, in the mountains of Solace and Solitude, there stood the Citadel of the Time Lords.
The oldest and most mighty race in the universe, looking down on the galaxies below, sworn never to interfere.
Only to watch.
Children of Gallifrey, taken from their families at the age of eight to enter the Academy.
And some say that's where it all began.
When he was a child.
That's when the Master saw eternity.
As a novice, he was taken for initiation.
He stood in front of the Untempered Schism, it’s a gap in the fabric of reality through which could be seen the whole of the Vortex.
You stand there, eight years old, staring at the raw power of time and space. Just a child.
Some would be inspired.
Some would run away.
And some would go mad.
I don't know.
MARTHA: What about you?
Oh, the ones that ran away. I never stopped.
(BEEPING) Encrypted channel with files attached.
Don't recognise it.
Hmm, patch it through to the laptop.
Since we're telling stories, there's something I haven't told you.
You work for Torchwood?
I swear to you, it's different, it's changed.
There's only half a dozen of us now.
Everything Torchwood did and you're part of it?
The old regime was destroyed at Canary Wharf.
I rebuilt it, I changed it, and when I did that, | did it for you.
In your honour.
If I haven't returned to my desk by 2200 this file will be emailed to Torchwood.
Which means if you're watching this, then I'm...
Anyway, the Saxon files are attached, but take a look at the Archangel document.
That's when it all started, when Harry Saxon became Minister in charge of launching the Archangel Network.
DOCTOR: What's the Archangel Network?
I've got Archangel, everyone's got it.
It's the mobile phone network. ‘Cause look, it's gone worldwide.
They've got 15 satellites in orbit.
Even the other networks, they're all carried by Archangel.
It's in the phones! Oh, I said he was a hypnotist.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
(BEEPING) There it is! That rhythm. It's everywhere.
Ticking away in the subconscious.
What is it, mind control?
No, no, no, no. Subtler than that.
Any strong-willed people would question it.
But contained in that rhythm, in layers of code, "Vote Saxon. Believe in me.” Whispering to the world.
Oh! Yes! That's how he hid himself from me!
‘Cause I should've sensed there was another Time Lord on Earth.
I should've known way back, but the signal cancelled him out.
Any way you can stop it?
Not from down here. But now we know how he's doing it.
And we can fight back?
Oh, yes!
Three Tardis keys, three pieces of the Tardis, all with low-level perception properties because the Tardis is designed to blend in.
Well, sort of, but now, the Archangel Network's got a second low-level signal.
Weld the key to the network, and Martha...
Look at me, you can see me, yes?
Yep!
What about now?
No, I'm here, look at me.
It's like I know you're there, but I don't want to know.
And back again!
See? It just shifts your perception, a tiny little bit.
Doesn't make us invisible. Just unnoticed.
Oh! I know what it's like! It's like...
It's like when you fancy someone, and they don't even know you exist.
That's what it's like. Come on!
You too, huh?
DOCTOR: Don't run.
Don't shout, just keep your voice down.
Draw attention to yourself and the spell is broken.
Just keep to the shadows.
Like ghosts.
Yeah.
That's what we are. Ghosts.
And as the eyes of the world turn towards Great Britain sources indicate that Air Force One has landed on British soil tonight.
Mr President, sir!
Mr Saxon, the British Army will stand down.
From now on, UNIT has control of this operation.
You make it sound like an invasion.
The First Contact Policy was decided by the Security Council in 1968 and you've just gone and ignored it.
Well, you know what it’s like, new job, all that paperwork.
I think it's down the back of the settee.
I did have a quick look, I found a pen, a sweet, a bus ticket, and... Have you met the wife?
Mr Saxon, I'm not sure what your game is, but there are provisions at the UN to have you removed from office unless you are very, very careful.
Is that understood?
Are you taking this seriously? To business, We've accessed your files on these Toclafane.
But First Contact cannot take place on any sovereign soil.
To that purpose, the aircraft carrier Valiantis en route, The rendezvous will take place there at 8:00 am.
(MUMBLING) You're trying my patience, sir.
So America is completely in charge?
Since Britain elected an ass, yes.
I'll see you on board the Valiant.
It still will be televised, though, won't it?
Because I promised, and the whole world is watching.
Since it's too late to pull out, the world will be watching.
Me.
The last President of America.
We have a private plane ready and waiting.
We should reach the Valiant within the hour.
My darling...
(SIREN WAILING) (LAUGHING) Hi, guys!
What are you doing!
Al! All will be revealed.
Saxon!
Oh, my God!
Don't move.
But...
Don't!
I'm gonna kill him.
What say I use this perception filter to walk up behind him and break his neck?
Now that sounds like Torchwood.
Still a good plan.
He's a Time Lord. Which makes him my responsibility.
I'm not here to kill him. I'm here to save him.
Aircraft carrier Valiant, that's a UNIT ship, at 58.2 North, 10.02 East.
How do we get on board?
Does that thing work as a teleport?
Since you revamped it, yeah.
Coordinates set.
MARTHA: Oh, that thing is rough!
I've had worse nights.
(SCREAMS) Welcome to the Valiant.
It's dawn.
Hold on, I thought this was a ship, where's the sea?
A ship for the 21st century.
Protecting the skies of planet Earth.
OVER PA: Europe now online.
Awaiting confirmation from South America and keep tracking japan.
I want the whole thing branded with my Seal of Office, not the UN, have you got that?
Anything I can do?
I could make the tea? Or isn't that American enough?
I don't know, I could make grits. What are grits anyway?
If you could just sit.
Misery guts. What do you think? It's good, isn't it?
It's beautiful.
Some of my best work.
Ministry of Defence, I helped design this place.
Every detail.
We've no time for sight-seeing!
No, wait, shh, shh.
Can't you hear it?
Hear what?
Doctor, my family's on board... Brilliant!
This way!
Oh, at last!
Oh, yes!
What's it doing on the Valiant?
What the hell's he done?
DOCTOR: Don't touch it!
I'm not going to!
MARTHA: What's he done, though? Sounds like it's sick.
DOCTOR: It can't be.
No, no, no, no, no, no, it can't be.
Doctor, what is it?
He's cannibalised the Tardis.
Is this what I think it is?
It's a paradox machine.
Two minutes, everyone.
According to the treaty, all armed personnel are requested to leave the flight deck immediately, thank you.
Jelly baby?
PRESIDENT: Broadcasting at 7:58, with the arrival timed for 0800 hours exactly.
And good luck to all of us.
As soon as this hits red, it activates.
At this speed, it'll trigger at 8:02.
First Contact is at 8:00, then two minutes later...
But what's it for? What does a paradox machine do?
More important, can you stop it?
Not till I know what it's doing.
Touch the wrong bit, blow up the solar system.
Then we've gotta get to the Master!
Yeah, how we gonna stop him?
Oh, I've got a way.
Sorry, didn’t I mention it?
And in just 30 seconds’ time, we'll be going live to First Contact.
It's been announced that Harold Saxon has invited President Winters to take the address.
It's 3:00 am in the morning on the Eastern Seaboard and President Winters has been chosen to lead the world into a new age.
My fellow Americans, patriots, people of the world.
I stand before you today as ambassador for humanity.
A role I will undertake with the utmost solemnity.
Perhaps our Toclafane cousins can offer us much.
But what is important is not that we gain material benefits, but that we learn to see ourselves anew.
For as long as man has looked to the stars he has wondered what mysteries they hold.
Now we know we are not alone, This plan, you gonna tell us?
If I can get this around the Master's neck, cancel out his perception, they'll see him for real.
It's just hard to go unnoticed when everyone is on red alert.
If they stop me, you've got a key.
Yes, sir. I'll get him.
And I ask you now, I ask of the human race, to join with me in welcoming our friends.
I give you the Toclafane.
My name is Arthur Coleman Winters, President Elect of the United States of America, and Designated Representative of the United Nations.
I welcome you to the planet Earth and its associated moon.
SPHERE 2: You're not the Master.
SPHERE 1: We like the Mr Master.
SPHERE 3: We don’t like you.
I can be master if you so wish.
I will accept mastery over you if that is God's will.
SPHERE 2: Man is stupid.
SPHERE 3: Master is our friend.
SPHERE 1: Where's my Master, pretty please?
Oh, all right, then. It's me!
Ta-da! Sorry!
Sorry, I have this effect, people just get obsessed.
Is it the smile, is it the aftershave, is it the capacity to laugh at myself?
I don't know! It's crazy!
Saxon, what are you talking about?
I'm taking control, Uncle Sam. Starting with you.
Kill him!
Guards, nobody move! Nobody move!
Now then!
Peoples of the Earth, please attend carefully.
MASTER: Stop him!
We meet at last, Doctor.
Oh! I love saying that!
Stop this! Stop it now!
As if a perception filter is gonna work on me.
And look, it's the girlie and the freak.
Although I'm not sure which one’s which.
Laser screwdriver. Who'd have sonic?
And the good thing is, he's not dead for long. I get to kill him again!
Master, just calm down.
Just look at what you're doing, just stop.
If you could see yourself.
Do excuse me, little bit of personal business. Back in a minute.
Let him go.
It's that sound, the sound in your head. What if I can help?
Oh! How to shut him up?
I know! Memory lane!
Professor Lazarus, remember him? And his genetic manipulation device!
What, did you think little Tish got that job merely by coincidence?
I've been laying traps for you all this time!
And if I can concentrate all that Lazarus technology into one little screwdriver...
But, ooh, if only I had the Doctor's biological code.
Oh! Wait a minute! I do!
I've got his hand!
And if Lazarus made himself younger, what if I reverse it?
Another 100 years?
Teleport. I can't.
We can’t stop him.
Get out of here.
Get out.
(DOCTOR SCREAMING) Doctor, I've got you.
MASTER: Ah, she's a would-be doctor.
But tonight, Martha Jones, we've flown them in, all the way from prison.
Mum. I'm sorry.
The Toclafane. What are they?
Who are they?
Doctor, if I told you the truth, your hearts would break.
SPHERE 2: Is it time? SPHERE 3: Is if ready?
SPHERE 1: Is the machine singing?
Two minutes past!
So, Earthlings!
Basically, um...
End of the world.
Here come the drums!
(VOODOO CHILD PLAYING) How many do you think?
I don't know!
MASTER: Six billion!
Down you go, kids!
Shall we decimate them?
That sounds good, nice word, decimate.
Remove one tenth of the population!
WOMAN: This is Geneva! We're getting slaughtered down here!
Valiant, report! Help us! For God's sake help us!
MAN: This is London, Valiant. This is London. What do we do?
They're killing us! The Toclafane... They're killing us!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) I'm coming back.
And so it came to pass that the human race fell and the Earth was no more, And I looked down upon my new dominion as master of all.
And I thought it good.
(BREATHING HEAVILY) MASTER: Ever since I was a child, I looked into the Vortex, that's when it chose me.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
The Master is Prime Minister of Great Britain.
And these are my friends.
They're called the Toclafane.
What?
Are you going to tell us who he is?
He's a Time Lord.
He's cannibalised the Tardis. It's a paradox machine.
We meet at last, Doctor.
Stop this! Stop it now!
We can’t stop him.
Down you go, kids. Remove one tenth of the population.
I'm coming back.
And the Earth was no more.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) WOMAN: Spacelane traffic is advised to stay away from SOL 3, also known as Earth.
Pilots are warned SOL 3 is now entering terminal extinction.
Planet Earth is closed.
Planet Earth is closed. Planet Earth is closed.
What's your name, then?
Tom Milligan.
No need to ask who you are, the famous Martha Jones.
How long since you were last in Britain?
365 days. It's been a long year.
So what's the plan?
This Professor Docherty, I need to see her. Can you get me there?
She works in a repair shed, Nuclear Plant Seven. I can get you inside.
What's this all for? What's so important about her?
Sorry. The more you know, the more you're at risk.
There's a lot of people depending on you. You're a bit of a legend.
And what does the legend say?
That you sailed the Atlantic, walked across America, that you were the only person to get out of Japan alive.
Martha Jones, they say, she's gonna save the world.
A bit late for that.
How come you can drive? Don't you get stopped?
Medical staff. Used to be in paediatrics back in the old days.
But that gives me a licence to travel so I can help out at the labour camps.
Great. I'm travelling with a doctor.
Story goes that you're the only person on Earth who can kill him.
That you and you alone can kill the Master stone dead.
Let's just drive.
ON PA: Citizens, rejoice!
Your Lord and Master stands on high!
Playing track three.
#I can't decide # Whether you should live or die # Of, you'll probably go to heaven # Please don't hang your head and cry # No wonder why # My heart feels dead inside # It's cold and hard and petrified # Lock the doors and close the blinds # We're going for a ride # Of, I could throw you in the lake # Or feed you poisoned birthday cake # I won't deny I'm gonna miss you when you're gone # Of, I could bury you alive # But you might crawl out with a knife # And kill me when I'm sleeping That's why #I can't decide # Whether you should live or die # Of, you'll probably go to heaven # Please don't hang your head and cry # I wonder why # My heart feels dead inside # It's cold and hard and petrified # Lock the doors and close the blinds... # It's ready to rise, Doctor.
The new Time Lord Empire. It's good, isn't it? Isn't it, good?
Anything?
No? Anything?
Oh, but they broke your heart, didn't they, those Toclafane?
Ever since you worked out what they really are.
They say Martha Jones has come back home.
Now why would she do that?
Leave her alone.
But you said something to her, didn't you?
On the day I took control.
What did you tell her?
I have one thing to say to you.
You know what it is.
Oh, no you don't!
Valiant now entering Zone One airspace.
Citizens, rejoice!
Come on, people! What are we doing?
Launch day in 24 hours!
Morning, Tish!
Ah! Smell that sea air!
Makes me long for good old British fish and chips.
(JACK LAUGHING) And what do I get? Cold mashed swede.
Some hotel. Last time I book over the internet.
MARTHA: All over the Earth, those things.
He's even carved himself into Mount Rushmore.
Best to keep down.
Here we go.
The entire South Coast of England converted into shipyards.
They bring in slave labour every morning, break up cars, houses, anything, just for the metal, building the fleet out of scrap.
You should see Russia. That's Shipyard Number One.
All the way from the Black Sea to the Bering Strait, there's 100,000 rockets getting ready for war.
War? With who?
The rest of the universe.
I've been out there, Tom, in space, before all this happened, and there's 1,000 different civilisations all around us with no idea of what's happening here.
The Master can build weapons big enough to devastate them all.
You've been in space?
Problem with that?
No! No, just... Wow.
Anything else I should know?
I've met Shakespeare.
(SPHERES WHIRRING) ~SPHERE: Identify, little man.
I've got a licence!
Thomas Milligan, Peripatetic Medical Squad. I'm allowed to travel.
I was just checking for...
Soon the rockets will fly!
SPHERE 2: And everyone will need medicine! You'll be so busy!
(SPHERES LAUGHING) But... they didn’t see you.
How do you think I travelled the world?
The Master set up Archangel, that mobile phone network, 15 satellites around the planet.
But really it's transmitting this low-level psychic field.
That's how everyone got hypnotised into thinking he was Harold Saxon.
Saxon! Feels like years ago.
But the key's tuned in to the same frequency.
Makes me sort of, not invisible, just unnoticeable.
Well, I can see you.
That's ‘cause you wanted to.
Yeah, I suppose I did.
Is there a Mrs Milligan?
No.
No. What about you?
There used to be someone.
Long time ago.
Come on, I've got to find this Docherty woman.
Well, we'll have to wait till the next work shift.
What time is it now?
It's nearly 3:00.
Time for my massage. Who shall I have today?
Tanya! Come on, sweetheart.
Lucy, have you met Tanya? She's gorgeous!
Tanya, when we go to the stars, I'm going to take you to the Catrigan Nova. Whirlpools of gold.
You two should get to know each other. That might be fun.
What the hell?
Condition red! Repeat, condition red!
Oh, I see.
I told you.
I have one thing to say.
Oh, here we go again.
Isomorphic controls.
Which means they only work for me.
Like this!
Say sorry! Sorry, sorry!
Mum! Sorry!
Didn't you learn anything from the blessed St Martha?
Siding with the Doctor is a very dangerous thing to do.
Take them away.
MAN: Move! Come on. MASTER: Okay, got you.
(GRUNTING) There you go, gramps.
Oh! Do you know...
I remember the days when the Doctor, oh, that famous Doctor, was waging a Time War, battling Sea Devils and Axons.
He sealed the rift at the Medusa Cascade single-handed!
And look at him now.
Stealing screwdrivers. How did he ever come to this?
Oh, yeah! Me!
I just need you to listen.
No, it's my turn.
Revenge! Best served hot!
And this time it's a message for Miss Jones.
(GRUNTING) Professor Docherty?
Busy.
They sent word ahead. I'm Tom Milligan. This is Martha Jones.
She can be the Queen of Sheba for all I care, I'm still busy.
Televisions don't work any more.
Oh, God, I miss Countdown.
Never been the same since Des took over. Both Deses.
What's the plural for Des? Desii? Deseen?
But we've been told there's gonna be a transmission.
From the man himself! There!
My people! Salutations.
On this, the eve of war. Lovely woman.
But I know there's all sorts of whispers down there, stories of a child walking the Earth, giving you hope.
But I ask you, how much hope has this man got?
Say hello, Gandalf!
Except he's not that old, but he's an alien with a much greater lifespan than you stunted little apes.
What if it showed?
What if I suspend your capacity to regenerate?
All 900 years of your life, Doctor, what if we could see them?
Older and older and older.
Down you go, Doctor!
Down, down.
Down the years.
Doctor?
Received and understood, Miss Jones?
I'm sorry.
The Doctor's still alive.
Obviously, the Archangel network would seem to be the Master's greatest weakness.
15 satellites all around the Earth still transmitting.
That's why there's so little resistance.
It's broadcasting a telepathic signal that keeps people scared.
We could just take them out.
We could. 15 ground-to-air missiles. You got any on you?
Besides, any military action, the Toclafane descend, They're not called Toclafane. That's a name the Master made up.
What are they, then?
Well, that's why I came to find you. Know your enemy.
I've got this.
No one’s been able to look at a sphere close up. They can't even be damaged.
Except once. A lightning strike in South Africa brought one of them down.
Just by chance. I've got the readings on this.
Oh!
Whoever thought we'd miss Bill Gates?
So is that why you travelled the world? To find a disc?
No, just got lucky.
I heard stories that you walked the Earth to find a way to build a weapon.
There!
"A current of 58.5 kiloamperes “transfer a charge of 510 megajoules precisely.” ~Can you recreate that?
I think so. Easily, yes.
Right then, Dr Milligan. We're gonna get us a sphere.
He's coming! You ready?
You do your job, I'll do mine!
Now!
(BUZZING) That's only half the job.
Let's find out what's inside, FRANCINE: I'm going kill him if I have to wait 100 years.
I'm going to kill the Master.
One day, he'll let his guard down. One day. And I'll be there.
No, that's my job.
I swear to you, I'd shoot that man stone dead.
I'll get him, even if it kills me.
Don't say that.
I mean it.
That man made us stand on deck and watch the islands of Japan burning.
Millions of people.
I swear to you, he's dead.
Tomorrow they launch.
We're opening up a rift in the Braccatolian space.
Won't see us coming. Kind of scary.
Then stop.
Once the empire is established and there's a new Gallifrey in the heavens, maybe then it stops.
The drumming.
The never-ending drumbeat.
Ever since I was a child, I looked into the Vortex.
That's when it chose me. The drumming, the call to war.
Can't you hear it?
Listen, it's there now, right now. Tell me you can hear it, Doctor.
Tell me.
It's only you.
Good.
SPHERE: Tomorrow, the war! Tomorrow we rise, never to fall!
You see? I'm doing it for them. You should be grateful.
After all, you love them.
So very, very much.
There's some sort of magnetic clamp. Hold on, I'll just trip the...
Oh, my God!
It's alive!
Martha. Martha Jones, It knows you.
Sweet, kind Martha Jones. You helped us to fly.
What do you mean?
You led us to salvation.
Who are you?
The skies are made of diamonds.
No.
You can't be him.
The skies are made of diamonds.
We share each other's memories. You sent him to Utopia.
Oh, my God!
What's it talking about? What's it mean?
What are they?
Martha. Martha, tell us. What are they?
They're us. They're humans.
The human race from the future.
I took Lucy to Utopia.
A Time Lord and his human companion.
I took her to see the stars. Isn't that right, sweetheart?
Trillions of years into the future. To the end of the universe.
Tell him what you saw.
Dying. Everything dying.
The whole of creation was falling apart. And I thought, “There's no point.
"No point to anything. Not ever.” And it's all your fault.
I'd sort of worked it out, with the paradox machine, because the Doctor said, on the day before the Master came to power, he said...
When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do was fuse the coordinates.
I locked them permanently.
He could only travel between the year 100 trillion and the last place the Tardis landed. Which is right here, right now.
The Master had the Tardis, this time machine.
But the only other place he could go was the end of the universe, so he found Utopia.
You should have seen it, Doctor. Furnaces. Burning.
The last of humanity screaming at the dark.
The Utopia project was the last hope.
Trying to find a way to escape the end of everything.
There was no solution. No diamonds. Just the dark and the cold.
All that human invention that had sustained them across the aeons, it all turned inward. They cannibalised themselves.
SPHERE: We made ourselves so pretty.
Regressing into children, but it didn't work.
MASTER: The universe was collapsing around them.
But then the Master came with his wonderful time machine, to bring us back home.
But that's a paradox. If you're the future of the human race, and you've come back to murder your ancestors, you should cancel yourselves out. You shouldn't exist.
And that's the paradox machine.
(LAUGHING) My masterpiece, Doctor.
A living Tardis, strong enough to hold the paradox in place.
Allowing the past and the future to collide in infinite majesty.
But you're changing history.
Not just Earth, the entire universe.
I'm a Time Lord. I have that right.
But even then...
why come all this way just to destroy?
We come backwards in time all to build a brand-new empire lasting 100 trillion years!
With me as their Master, Time Lord and humans combined.
Haven't you always dreamt of that, Doctor?
What about us? We're the same species.
Why do you kill so many of us?
Because it's fun.
(LAUGHING) Human race. Greatest monsters of them all.
Night, then.
I think it's time we had the truth, Miss Jones.
Legend says you travelled the world to find a way of killing the Master.
Tell us, is it true?
Just before I escaped, the Doctor told me...
The Doctor and the Master, they've been coming to Earth for years.
And they've been watched.
There's UNIT and Torchwood, all studying Time Lords in secret.
And they made this, the ultimate defence.
All you need is to get close, I can shoot the Master dead with this.
Actually, you can put that down now, thank you very much.
Point is, it's not so easy to kill a Time Lord.
They can regenerate, literally bring themselves back to life.
Ah, the Master's immortal! Wonderful!
Except for this.
Four chemicals slotted into the gun.
Inject him, kills a Time Lord permanently.
Four chemicals, you've only got three.
Still need the last one.
‘Cause the components of this gun were kept safe, scattered across the world, and I found them.
San Diego, Beijing, Budapest and London.
Then where is it?
There's an old UNIT base in North London.
I've found the access codes. Tom, you've got to get me there.
We can't get across London in the dark.
It's full of wild dogs, we'll get eaten alive.
We can wait till the morning then go with the medical convoy.
You can spend the night here, if you like.
No, we can get halfway, stay at the slave quarters in Bexley.
Professor, thank you.
Oh, and you. Good luck.
Thanks.
Martha. Could you do it?
Could you actually kill him?
Got no choice, You might be many things, but you don't look like a killer to me.
Let me in, it's Milligan.
Did you bring food?
Couldn't get any. And I'm starving.
WOMAN: All we've got is water.
MARTHA: Sorry.
It's cheaper than building barracks.
Pack them in, 100 in each house, ferry them off to the shipyards every morning.
Are you Martha Jones?
Yeah, that's me.
Can you kill him? They said you can kill the Master. Can you?
Tell us you can do it. Please, tell us you can do it.
WOMAN: Who is the Master?
(ALL CHATTERING) Come on, just leave her alone. She's exhausted.
No, it’s all right.
They want me to talk and I will.
Access Priority One. This is Professor Alison Docherty.
State your intent.
First of all, I need to know about my son.
State your intent.
Is my son still alive?
State your intent.
I have some information for the Master.
Concerning Martha Jones.
Guess what?
I travelled across the world.
From the ruins of New York to the Fusion Mills of China, right across the Radiation Pits of Europe.
And everywhere I went I saw people just like you, living as slaves.
But if Martha Jones became a legend, then that's wrong, because my name isn't important. There's someone else.
The man who sent me out there. The man who told me to walk the Earth.
And his name is the Doctor.
He has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there.
He never stops, he never stays, he never asks to be thanked.
But I've seen him. I know him.
I love him.
And I know what he can do.
It's him! It's him! My God, it's him! It's the Master! He's here!
But he never comes to Earth! He never walks upon the ground.
Hide her!
He walks among us, our Lord and Master.
Martha! Martha Jones! I can see you.
Out you come, little girl. Come and meet your Master.
Anybody? Nobody? No? Nothing?
Positions!
(GUNS COCKING) I'll give the order unless you surrender.
Ask yourself, "What would the Doctor do?" Oh, yes! Oh, very well done! Good girl!
He trained you well.
Bag. Give me the bag.
No, stay there, just throw it.
And now, good companion, your work is done.
No!
But you, when you die, the Doctor should be witness, hmm?
(INHALING) Almost dawn, Martha, and planet Earth marches to war.
ON PA: Citizens of Earth, rejoice and observe, Your teleport device, in case you thought I'd forgotten.
And now kneel.
Down below, the fleet is ready to launch.
200,000 ships set to burn across the universe.
Are we ready?
MAN: The fleet awaits your signal, rejoice!
Three minutes to align the Black Hole Convertors.
Counting down!
I never could resist a ticking clock.
My children, are you ready?
ALL: We will fly and blaze and slice! We will fly and blaze and slice!
At zero, to mark this day, the child, Martha Jones, will die.
My first blood.
Any last words? No?
Such a disappointment, this one. Days of old, Doctor, you had companions who could absorb the Time Vortex!
This one's useless! Bow your head.
And so it falls to me, as Master of all, to establish from this day a new order of Time Lords.
From this day forward...
(LAUGHING SOFTLY) What? What's so funny?
A gun?
What about it?
A gun in four parts?
Yes, and I destroyed it.
A gun, in four parts, scattered across the world?
I mean, come on! Did you really believe that?
What do you mean?
As if I would ask her to kill.
Oh, well, it doesn't matter. I've got her exactly where I want her.
But I knew what Professor Docherty would do.
The Resistance knew about her son.
That's why I came to find you. Know your enemy.
I told her about the gun so she'd get me here.
At the right time.
But you're still gonna die.
Don't you want to know what I was doing, travelling the world?
Tell me.
I told a story. That's all.
No weapons, just words. I did just what the Doctor said.
I went across the continents all on my own.
And everywhere I went I found the people and I told them my story.
He has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there.
I know him.
I told them about the Doctor.
I love him.
And I told them to pass it on.
To spread the word so that everyone would know about the Doctor.
Faith and hope? Is that all?
No, ‘cause I gave them an instruction.
Just as the Doctor said.
Use the countdown.
I told them that if everyone thinks of one word, at one specific time...
Nothing will happen! Is that your weapon?
Prayer?
Right across the world.
One word, just one thought, at one moment, but with 15 satellites.
What?
The Archangel network.
A telepathic field binding the whole human race together.
With all of them, every single person on Earth, thinking the same thing at the same time.
And that word is "Doctor".
Stop it. No, no, no, no, you don't.
Doctor. Doctor.
Don't...
ALL: Doctor!
Doctor!
CLIVE: Doctor. ALL: Doctor! Doctor!
Stop this right now! Stop it!
Doctor. Doctor.
Doctor. ~All: (CHANTING) Doctor!
I've had a whole year to tune myself into the psychic network and integrate with its matrices.
I order you to stop!
ALL: (CHANTING) Doctor!
Doctor.
The one thing you can't do is stop them thinking.
Tell me the human race is degenerate now, when they can do this.
No!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Then I'll kill them!
You can't do this! You can't do... It's not fair!
And you know what happens now.
No!
No!
No! No!
You wouldn't listen.
No!
Because you know what I'm going to say.
No.
I forgive you.
My children!
ALL: Protect the paradox! Protect the paradox!
Protect the paradox!
Captain, the paradox machine!
You men, with me!
You stay here.
No!
Now it ends, Doctor!
Now it ends!
(ALARMS BLARING) We've all six billion spheres heading right for us!
We've got control of the Valiant. You can't launch.
Oh, but I've got this. Black Hole Convertor inside every ship.
If I can't have this world, Doctor, then neither can you.
We shall stand upon this Earth together as it burns!
~Can't get in, we'd get slaughtered.
Yeah, happens to me a lot.
Weapon after weapon after weapon.
All you do is talk and talk and talk.
But over all these years, and all these disasters, I've always had the greatest secret of them all.
I know you.
Explode those ships, you kill yourself. That's the one thing you can never do.
Give that to me.
Everyone, get down! Time is reversing.
(ALL SCREAMING) The paradox is broken. We've reverted back.
One year and one day, two minutes past eight in the morning.
MAN ON RADIO: This is UNIT Central, what's happened up there?
We just saw the President assassinated. “See.
Just after the President was killed, but just before the spheres arrived.
Everything back to normal, planet Earth restored.
None of it happened. The rockets, the terror, it never was.
What about the spheres?
Trapped at the end of the universe.
But I can remember it.
We're at the eye of the storm, the only ones who'll ever know.
Oh, hello! You must be Mr Jones! We haven't actually met.
Whoa, big fella! You don't want to miss the party. Cuffs.
So, what do we do with this one?
We kill him.
We execute him.
DOCTOR: No, that's not the solution.
Oh, I think so.
‘Cause all those things, they still happened.
Because of him.
I saw them.
Go on!
Do it.
Francine, you're better than him.
You still haven't answered the question. What happens to me?
You're my responsibility from now on. The only Time Lord left in existence.
Yeah, but you can't trust him. “No.
The only safe place for him is the Tardis, You mean you're just gonna keep me?
Mmm. If that's what I have to do.
It's time to change. Maybe I've been wandering for too long.
Now I've got someone to care for.
(GUNSHOT) JACK: Put it down.
There you go. I've got you, I've got you.
Always the women. I didn't see her.
Dying in your arms. Happy now?
You're not dying, don't be stupid. It's only a bullet, just regenerate.
No.
One little bullet, come on.
I guess you don't know me so well. I refuse.
Regenerate, just regenerate, please. Please, just regenerate, come on!
And spend the rest of my life imprisoned with you?
But you've got to. Come on, it can't end like this.
You and me. All the things we've done.
Axons! Remember the Axons, and the Daleks.
We're the only two left. There's no one else.
Regenerate!
How about that?
I win.
(GROANING) Will it stop, Doctor?
The drumming? Will it stop?
(DOCTOR YELLING) Just to say I don't blame you.
But who are you?
Time was every single one of these people knew your name.
Now they've all forgotten you.
Good.
Back to work.
I really don't mind, though.
Come with me.
Had plenty of time to think that past year.
The year that never was.
And I kept thinking about that team of mine.
Like you said, Doctor. Responsibility.
Defending the Earth. Can't argue with that.
Hey, I need that!
I can't have you walking round with a time-travelling teleport.
You could go anywhere. Twice. Second time to apologise.
And what about me? Can you fix that? Will ever be able to die?
Nothing I can do. You're an impossible thing, Jack.
Been called that before.
Sir.
Ma'am.
But I keep wondering, what about ageing?
‘Cause I can't die, but I keep getting older, the odd little grey hair, you know.
What happens if I live for a million years?
I really don't know.
Okay, vanity, sorry. Yeah.
Can't help it. Used to be a poster boy!
When I was a kid, living in the Boeshane Peninsula, tiny little place.
I was the first one ever to be signed up for the Time Agency.
They were so proud of me. The Face of Boe they called me.
I'll see you.
No.
Can't be, No. Definitely not. No.
No!
Yeah, could you put me through?
Hi, I'm looking for a Dr Thomas Milligan.
Yeah? Hello?
Hello?
Right then! Off we go. The open road!
There is a burst of starfire right now over the coast of Meta Sigmafolio.
Oh, the sky is like oil on water.
Fancy a look? Or back in time. We could...
I don't know, Charles II? Henry VIII?
I know, what about Agatha Christie!
I'd love to meet Agatha Christie, bet she's brilliant!
Okay.
I just can't.
Yeah.
I've spent all these years training to be a doctor, and now I've got people to look after.
They saw half the planet slaughtered and they're devastated.
I can't leave them.
Course not.
Thank you.
Martha Jones, you saved the world.
Yes, I did.
I spent a lot of time with you thinking I was second best, but you know what?
lam good.
You going to be all right?
Always, yeah.
Right, then.
Bye.
‘Cause the thing is, it's like my friend Vicky.
She lived with this bloke, student housing, there were five of them, all packed in, and this bloke was called Shaun.
And she loved him, she did, she completely adored him, spent all day long talking about him...
Is this going anywhere? “Yes.
‘Cause he never looked at her twice.
I mean, he liked her, that was it.
And she wasted years pining after him, years of her life, ‘cause while he was around, she never looked at anyone else.
And I told her, I always said to her, time and time again, I said, "Get out." So this is me... getting out.
Keep that. ‘Cause I'm not having you disappear!
If that rings, when that rings, you'd better come running, got it?
Got it.
I'll see you again, mister.
(DISTANT LAUGHTER) (HORN BLARING) What?
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
What?
WHAT?
What?
Ri-i-i-ght...
'Attention all passengers.
'The Titanic is now in orbit 'above Sol 3, also known as Earth, population  Human.
'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Christmas! ' Orbit, nice and steady.
Good work, Mr Cavill.
And maintain position.
Now then, gentlemen, according to the traditions of the planet below, Christmas is a time of celebration.
I think you might be entitled to a tot of rum.
Just the one!
Off you go. Sir. Sir.
I'll keep watch.
Sir.
And you, what was it?
Midshipman Frame, sir.
Only just qualified, sir. First trip out!
Then you can stand down, Midshipman.
<i>But, erm...</i> Regulations say the bridge has to be staffed by two crew members at any one time, sir.
Well said. Very good!
Well, it should be nice and quiet.
It's only a Level 5 planet down below 
they don't even know we're here.
Silent night, I believe they call it.
A silent night.
Max Capricorn Cruiseliners, the fastest, the furthest, the best.
And I should know, because...
my name is Max!
Merry Christmas, sir. Merry Christmas.
It's not a holiday for me, not while I've still got my vone, now do as I say and sell!
Evening, Passenger 57, terrible memory, remind me, you would be?
<i>Information. Heavenly Host, supplying tourist information.</i> Good! So, tell me, cos I'm an idiot, where are we from?
Information. The Titanic is en route from the Planet Sto in the Cassavalian Belt.
The purpose of the cruise is to experience primitive cultures.
Titanic, erm, who thought of the name?
Information. It was chosen as the most famous vessel of the Planet Earth.
Did they tell you why it was famous?
Information. All designations are chosen by Mr Max Capricorn, President of Max... Max... Max... Max...
<i>Max... Max... Max...</i> Oops! Bit of a glitch. Sorry, sir, we can handle this.
<i>Max... Max... Max...</i> Software problem, that's all, leave it with us, sir. Merry Christmas!
That's another one down, what's going wrong with these things?
That's eight of them now, on the blink.
One woman asked the Host to fix her necklace, it almost broke her neck.
In first class!
I've been over the robotics, nothing.
It's like something's got into them, some kind of bug.
Whoa, wait, wait.
Over there, bay 15!
Tell you what, if you can't fix them, throw them overboard.
Over there on the left.
Oh, for Tov's sake, look where you're going!
This jacket's a genuine Earth antique!
I'm sorry, sir. You'll be sorry when it comes off your wages, sweetheart!
Staffed by idiots! No wonder Max Capricorn's going down the drain!
Careful! There we go.
Thank you, sir, I can manage. I never said you couldn't!
I'm the Doctor, by the way. Astrid, sir, Astrid Peth.
Nice to meet you, Astrid. Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, sir. Just Doctor, not sir.
You enjoying the cruise? Um, yeah, I suppose, I dunno.
It doesn't quite work, a cruise, on your own.
You're not with anyone? No, no, just me, just, er...
Used to be, but, erm...
No. What about you?
Long way from home, Planet Sto.
Doesn't feel that different.
Spent three years working at the spaceport diner, travel all the way here, and I'm still waiting on tables.
No shore leave?
We're not allowed, they can't afford the insurance.
I just wanted to try it, just once...
I used to watch the ships heading out to the stars. And I always dreamt of...
It sounds daft. You dreamt of another sky.
<i>New sun,</i> new air, new life, a whole universe teeming with life.
Why stand still when there's all that life out there?
So... you... travel a lot?
All the time. Just for fun.
Well, that's the plan, never quite works.
You must be rich, though.
<i>Haven't got a penny.</i> Stowaway.
Kidding?
Seriously! No! Oh, yeah!
How'd you get on board?
Accident! I've got this sort of ship-thing, I was just rebuilding her, left the defences down, bumped into the Titanic, here I am.
Bit of a party. I thought, why not?
I should report you. Go on, then.
I'll get you a drink.
On the house.
Just ignore them.
Something's tickled them. They told us it was fancy dress.
Very funny, I'm sure. They're just picking on us because we haven't paid. We won our tickets in a competition.
I had to name the five husbands of Joofie Crystalle in By The Light Of The Asteroid!
D' you ever watch By The Light Of The Asteroid?
Is that the one with the twins? That's it! It's marvellous!
But we're not good enough for that lot, they think we should be in steerage.
Oh, can't have that, can we?
Did you do that? Maybe.
Oh, we like you! We do!
I'm Morvin Van Hoff, this is my good woman Foon.
Foon! Hello! I'm the Doctor. I'm going to need one, time I've finished with that buffet.
Have a buffalo wing!
They must be enormous, these buffalo, so many wings!
Attention, please, shore leave tickets Red 6-7 now activated, Red 6-7... ' Red 6-7, that's us!
Are you Red 6-7?
Might as well be! Come on, then!
We're going to Earth!
Seems to be power diverted to deck 31, sir.
It flared up, then it stopped.
Nothing to worry about, she's an old ship. Full of aches and pains.
Picking up a meteoroid shower, portside, bearing west 56, north 2.
Fairly standard in this part of space. Miles away.
We could probably see it, sir.
Red 6-7, Red 6-7, this way, fast as you can.
I got you that drink. And I got you a treat! C' mon.
Red 6-7, departing shortly. Red 6-7, plus one.
Er, quickly, sir, please, and take two teleport bracelets, if you would.
I'll get the sack. Brand new sky!
<i>To repeat, i am Mr Copper, the ship's historian,</i> and I shall be taking you to Old London Town in the country of Yookay.
Ruled over by Good King Wenceslas.
Now, human beings worship the great God, Santa, a creature with fearsome claws and his wife, Mary.
And every Christmas Eve, the people of Yookay go to war with the country of Turkey.
They then eat the Turkey-people for Christmas dinner. Like savages!
Excuse me, sorry, sorry, but...
um, where did you get all this from?
Well, I have a first-class degree in Earthonomics. Now, stand by.
And me! And me! Red 6-7!
Take a bracelet, please, sir.
But hold on, hold on... What was your name?
Bannakaffalatta!
OK, Bannakaffalatta, but it's Christmas Eve down there, late-night shopping, tons of people, he's like a talking conker...
No offence, but you'll cause a riot, cos the streets are gonna be packed with shoppers and parties and...
Oh. Now, spending money.
I have a credit card in Earth currency, if you want to buy trinkets or stockings or the local delicacy, which is known as beef, but don't stray too far, it could be dangerous!
Any day now, they start boxing.
It should be full. It should be busy, something's wrong.
But it's beautiful.
Really?!
D' you think so? It's just a street. The Pyramids are beautiful, and New Zealand...
But it's a different planet! I'm standing on a different planet!
There's... concrete!
And shops! Alien shops!
Real alien shops!
Look, no stars in the sky!
And it smells... It stinks!
Oh, this is amazing! Thank you!
Yeah?!
Come on, then, let's have a look.
Hello, there, sorry, obvious question, but... where's everybody gone?
Oh, ho, scared.
Right, yes, scared of what?
Where've you been living?
London! At Christmas!
Not safe, is it?
Why? Well, it's them! Up above.
Look, Christmas before last, we had that big bloody spaceship. Everyone standing on the roof!
And then last year, that Christmas Star, electrocuting all over the place, draining the Thames.
This place is amazing! And this year, Lord knows what.
So everyone's scarpered, gone to the country.
All except me, and Her Majesty.
'Her Majesty the Queen has confirmed that she will be staying in Buckingham Palace 'throughout the festive season, to show the people of London, 'and the world, that there's nothing to fear.' Gawd bless her.
We stand vigil.
Well, between you and me, I think Her Majesty's got it right.
As far as I know, this year, nothing to worry about.
Then again...
I was in mid-sentence!
Yes, I'm sorry about that, bit of a problem...
If I could have your bracelets?
Apologies, ladies and gentlemen and Bannakaffalatta, we seem to have suffered a power fluctuation.
If you'd like to return to the festivities, and on behalf of Max Capricorn Cruiseliners, free drinks will be provided.
Thank you.
That was the best. The best.
What sort of power fluctuation?
That's a bit odd, sir.
The meteoroids are changing course.
Still. We can put the shields up to maximum, just in case. As you were, Midshipman.
Sir?
You're magnetising the hull, sir. It's drawing the meteors in.
'Port turning earth side... ' I take it that's deliberate? Bit of a light-show for the guests?
Something like that.
'And I should know because my name is Max.
'The fastest, the furthest...
'... the best.
'My name is Max.' 'Captain? There's a meteoroid storm coming in... ' West zero by north two.
Who is this? Never mind, check your scanners!
You've meteoroids coming in and no shielding!
You have no authorisation, you will clear the comms at once.
Yeah? Just look starboard!
If you could come with me, sir.
But he's right, sir, the shields HAVE been taken offline.
Step away from there. But we have to re-energise, sir.
I said step away, Midshipman.
You've got a rockstorm heading for this ship, and no shields!
They promised me old men. I'm sorry, sir?
On the crew.
Sea dogs. Men who'd had their time.
Not boys.
Listen to me! This is an emergency!
Get to the lifeb...!
I'm sorry, sir, it's my duty.
Look out the windows!
If you don't believe me, check the shields yourself!
Sir, I can vouch for him!
Steward, he's just had a bit too much to drink.
 Something's wrong, all the teleports have gone down.
 Not now!
Oxygen membrane holding. Oxygen membrane holding.' You, there. Has anyone checked the external shielding?
Information.
You are all going to die.
Where's the Chief Steward?! He went that way, sir.
The shields are down, we're going to get hit!
You're gonna kill us... I'm dying already.
Six months.
And they offered me so much money...
... for my family.
Oi, Steward! I'm telling you, the shields are down!!
Listen to him, listen to him!
'Max Capricorn... ' Darling, come and have a look at this.
'The fastest... ' 'Red alert. Red alert.' '... the furthest...
'... the best...
'... the best... ' Help me! Help me!
Everybody, just please stay calm!
My foot!
My foot!
Help me!
Sh!
It's stopping.
You all right?
I think so.
Bad name for a ship.
Either that, or this suit is really unlucky.
Ladies and gentleman, and Bannakaffalatta...
I must apologise, on behalf of Max Capricorn Cruiseliners.
We seem to have had a small collision. Small!
D' you know how much I paid for my ticket?! If I could have silence.
QUIET!
Thank you. I'm sure Max Capricorn Cruiseliners will be able to reimburse you for any inconvenience.
But first, I would point out that we're very much alive... Doctor!
... it is, after all, a fine and sturdy ship.
If you could all stay here, while I ascertain the exact nature of the... situation.
Don't open it!
'Oxygen shield stabilised.' Everyone all right? Astrid? Foon?
Morvin, Mr Copper?
Bannakaffalatta? Yes.
You, what was your name? Rickston Slade. You all right?
No thanks to that idiot.
The steward just died!
Then he's a dead idiot!
All right, calm down!
Just stay still, all of you, hold on...
What happened? How come the shields were down?
I don't think it was an accident.
How many dead?
We're alive. Just focus on that.
I will get you out of here, Astrid.
I promise. Look at me.
I promise.
Good. Now, if we can get to reception, I've got a spaceship tucked away, we can all get on board and...
Oh-h-h. What is it, what's wrong?
That's my ship, over there. Where?
There, that box, that little blue box.
That's a spaceship? Oi, don't knock it.
It's a bit small. A bit distant.
Trouble is, once it's set adrift, it's programmed to lock on to the nearest centre of gravity.
And that would be...
... the Earth.
Don't just stand there, get this thing off me!
Host! That's an order! Help me! That IS your job, isn't it?
Information. We now have only one function.
And what's that?
Information. To kill.
What are you doing?
Host! I'm ordering you, stop it!
Stop it, right now!
Deck 22 to the bridge. Deck 22 to the bridge...
'is there anyone there? ' This is the bridge.
Oh! Hello, sailor! Good to hear you! What's the situation up there?
Erm... we've got air...
The oxygen field is holding. But the Captain...
He's dead.
He did it, oh, my Vot, he took down the shields...
There was nothing I could do, I tried, I did try.
All right, stay calm, what's your name?
Midshipman Frame.
Nice to meet you, sir. What's the state of the engines?
They're, um...
Hold on...
 Have you been injured?
I'm all right...
Oh, my Vot. They're cycling down.
That's a Nuclear Storm drive, yes?
'Yeah.' The moment they're gone, we lose orbit?
The planet...
Oh, yes.
If we hit the planet, the Nuclear Storm explodes and wipes out life on Earth.
I need you to fire up the Engine Containment Field and feed it back into the core.
That's never gonna work!
'Trust me, it'll keep the engines going' till I get there. We're gonna die!
Are you saying someone's done this on purpose?
We're gonna die!
OK, OK, just hush! First things first.
One, we're gonna climb through this ship.
<i>B  no, two  we're gonna reach the bridge.</i> Three, or C, we're gonna save the Titanic.
And coming in a very low four, or D, or that little "iv" in brackets they use on footnotes  why?
Right, then! Follow me.
Hang on a minute, who put you in charge?
And who the hell are you, anyway?
I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord.
I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous, I'm 903 years old, and I'm the man who's going to save your lives and all six billion people on the planet below.
You got a problem with that?
No. In that case...
allons-y!
Careful.
Follow me.
It's rather ironic, but this is very much in the spirit of Christmas.
It's a festival of violence!
They say that human beings only survive depending on whether they've been good or bad. It's barbaric!
Actually, that's not true, Christmas is a time of peace and thanksgiving and...
Oh, what am I on about? My Christmases are always like this!
Ah, we've got a Host!
Strength of ten!
If we can mend it, we can use it to fix the rubble.
We can do robotics! Both of us!
We work on the Milk Market back on Sto, it's all robot staff.
See if you can get it working.
Let's have a look...
It's blocked. So what do we do?
We shift it. That's the attitude!
Rickston! Mr Copper! And you, Bannakaffalatta...
Look, can I just call you Banna? It's gonna save a lot of time.
No! Bannakaffalatta!
All right then, Bannakaffalatta, there's a gap, in the middle, see if you can get through.
Easy! Good!
This whole thing could come crashing down!
Oh, Rickston, did you get that message?
No, what message? Shut up.
Bannakaffalatta made it!
I'm small enough, I can get through.
Careful. I'm fine.
Thing is, how are Mr and Mrs Fatso going to get through that gap?
We make the gap bigger. So start!
Hey, hey! Come on, sweetheart.
Don't listen to him.
No, but it's all my fault, though.
The tickets. We won them, fair and square. I know.
I never told you...
I dialled the competition line 5,000 times.
That's 5,000 credits, I might as well have paid for the tickets.
I've been hiding the vone bill for months now.
5,000 credits?
You spent 5,000 credits? Don't hate me.
What's so funny?
5,000?
We'll never pay that off. I know! We'll have to work for 20 years!
You mad bloody woman!
You're not cross?
Does it matter?
Well, look at us!
You drive me barmy!
I don't half love you, Mrs Van Hoff. C' mere.
 What happened, did they find a doughnut?
I can clear it from this side, just tell me if it starts moving!
Bannakaffalatta, what's wrong? Sh!
What is it? Can't say.
Are you hurt?
Ashamed.
Of what? Poor Bannakaffalatta!
You're a cyborg!
Had accident.
<i>Long ago. Secret.</i> No, but everything's changed, now!
Cyborgs are getting equal rights.
They passed a law, back on Sto, you can even get married.
<i>Marry you?</i> Well, you can buy me a drink first!
Come on, let's recharge you.
Just stay there for a bit.
Tell no-one. I promise.
What's going on up there?
Oh, I think Bannakaffalatta and I just got engaged.
 
This is the Bridge. This is kitchen number five.
How many of you are there?
Six of us. Just about. Are we the only ones left alive, sir?
No, there's more on deck 19...
Hold on, if I reverse the scanner...
There's 50, 60 people, still alive all over the ship, hold on...
<i>i can see you! Kitchen five, there you are!</i> Listen, everyone's heading for the bridge, don't go portside, there's no air, can you head starboard?
We're stuck, the doors have sealed, we can't get out.
No, wait a minute.
It's opening!
There's someone on the other side!
<i>Host, we've got Host! The Host are still working!</i> That's brilliant, tell them to clear a path to the bridge.
Did you get that?
Kitchen five, report.
Hello, kitchen five?
 <i>Report!</i> Almost done! Good, good, good!
Mr Frame, how's things? Doctor...
I've got life-signs all over, but they're going out, one by one.
What is it, are they losing air?
No, one of them said it was the Host, it's something to do with the Host.
It's working!
Kill... Turn it off, turn it off!
... kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...
Go! Morvin!
It's frozen, can't stop it!
Won't work... double deadlock!
... kill, kill...
Go upstairs! Run!
Information. Kill, kill, kill, kill...
Rickston! Get them through! No chance!
 Rickston!
 I'll never get through there!
Yes, you can, let me go first.
The Host have gone berserk! Are you safe?
Kill, kill, kill...
No, I'm stuck! Come on! You can do it!
It's gonna collapse.
Rickston, Vot damn it, help me!
No way! Morvin! Get through!
Kill, kill...
Doctor, he's stuck.
Mr Van Hoff, I know we've only just met but you'll have to excuse me.
<i>Got you! Doctor, come on! Get through!</i> Information override! What's the origin of your command structure?
I can't hold it! Information deck 31.
Thank you!
<i>Let go!</i> Morvin, look! Food!
Oh, great, someone's happy. Don't have any, then!
 <i>Mr Frame? Are you still there? Yes, sir.</i> But I've got Host outside, I've sealed the door.
They've been programmed to kill, why?
That's not the only problem, Doctor.
I had to use a maximum deadlock on the door. Which means...
no-one can get in.
I'm sealed off.
Even if you can fix the Titanic, 'you can't get to the bridge.' Yeah.
Right. Fine! One problem at a time. What is on deck 31?
That's down below, it's nothing...
It's just the Host Storage Deck, that's where we keep the robots.
But what's that? D' you see?
That panel of black, it's registering... nothing. No power, no heat, no light.
'I've never seen it before.' 100% shielded, what's down there?
I'll try intensifying the scanner.
Let me know if you find anything.
And keep those engines going!
Saved you some.
You might be a Time King from Gaddabee, but you still need to eat. Yeah. Thanks.
Though you look good for 903.
You should see me in the mornings. OK.
Doctor! Must be well past midnight, Earth time. Christmas Day.
So it is. Merry Christmas.
This Christmas thing, what's it all about?
<i>Long story.</i> I should know, I was there. I got the last room.
But if the planet's waking up, can't we signal them?
They could send up a rocket or something.
They don't have spaceships.
No, I've read about it, they have the shuffles. Space shuffles.
Mr Copper, this degree in Earthonomics, where's it from?
Honestly? Just between us.
Mrs Golightly's Happy Travelling University And Dry Cleaners.
D' you... You lied to the company?
To get the job?
I wasted my life on Sto.
I was a travelling salesman, always on the road, and I reached retirement with nothing to show for it, not even a home.
And Earth sounded so... exotic.
Mm, yeah, I suppose it is, yeah.
How come you know it so well?
I was sort of, um...
A few years ago, I was sort of made, well...
Sort of homeless, and...
There was the Earth.
The thing is, if we survive this, there'll be police, and all sorts of investigations...
Now the minimum penalty for space lane fraud is ten years in jail.
Well, I'm an old man, I won't survive ten years!
 <i>Host! Move! Come on!</i> Is that the only way across?
On the other hand, it is a way across.
The engines are open. Nuclear Storm drive.
Soon as it stops, the Titanic falls.
But that thing, it'll never take our weight. You're going last, mate.
It's nitrofine metal. It's stronger than it looks.
All the same, Rickston's right, me and Foon should go la...
<i>Morvin!</i> I told you! I told you!
 Just shut up, shut up!
 Bring him back!
Can't you bring him back? Bring him back, Doctor!
<i>I can't, I'm sorry, I can't. You promised me!</i> I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Doctor, I rather think those things have got our scent.
I'm not waiting. Careful!
Take it slowly!
Vot help me... You're OK! Step at a time.
Come on. You can do it.
... kill, kill...
They're getting nearer.
I've got to seal us in...
Leaving us trapped, wouldn't you say? Never say trapped. Just...
inconveniently circumstanced. Oh!
I'm OK... Maybe he's all right, maybe there's a gravity curve down there, or something, maybe he's just unconscious...
<i>I'm sorry, Foon.</i> <i>He's gone.</i> What am I gonna do without him?
Yes! Oh, yes! Who's good?!
Bannakaffalatta, you go next. Bannakaffalatta small! Slowly!
They've found us!
Astrid, get across, right now.
What about you? Just do it, go on!
Mr Copper, we can't wait, after you.
<i>Don't argue!</i> <i>Foon, you've got to get across right now.</i> What for? What am I going to do without him?
Doctor! The door's locked!
Just think, what would he want, eh?
He don't want nothing, he's dead!
Doctor! I can't open the door!
We need the whirring key thing of yours.
I can't leave her! She'll get us all killed if we can't get out!
Mrs Van Hoff! I am coming back for you. All right?
Too many people!
Oi! Don't get spiky with me. Keep going!
It's gonna fall! It's just settling. Keep going.
They've stopped.
<i>Gone away?</i> Why would they give up? Never mind that, keep coming!
But where have they gone?
Where are the Host?
I'm afraid we forgot the traditions of Christmas...
that angels have wings.
Information. Kill.
Arm yourself! All of you!
Argh!
Ohhh!
<i>I can't...</i> Bannakaffalatta, stop!
Bannakaffalatta proud!
Bannakaffalatta... cyborg!
Electromagnetic pulse took out the robotics!
Oh, Bannakaffalatta, that was brilliant!
He's used all his power.
Did good?
You saved our lives.
Bannakaffalatta happy.
We can recharge you, get you to a power point, plug you in.
Too late.
No, but you've got to get me that drink, remember?
Pretty girl.
I'm sorry, forgive me...
Leave him alone. It's the EMP transmitter, he'd want us to use it.
I used to sell these things, they'd always give me a bed for the night, in the Cyborg Caravans.
Good people.
But if we can recharge it, we can use it as a weapon against the rest of the Host.
Bannakaffalatta might have saved us all.
D' you think? Try telling him that.
Information. Reboot. Use the EMP!
It's dead. It's gotta have emergency...!
No! Hold on! Override! Loophole! Security Protocol... ten!
666? Uh, 21? 4, 5, 6, 7, 8? I don't know, 42?
<i>Erm... one!</i> Information. State request.
Good!
Right. You've been ordered to kill the survivors, but why?
Information. No witnesses.
But this ship's gonna kill everyone on Earth, the human race has nothing to do with the Titanic, that contravenes your orders!
Information. Incorrect. But...
Why destroy the Earth? Information. It is the plan. What plan?
Information. Protocol grants you only three questions, these three questions have been used.
Well, you could've warned me!
Information. Now you will die.
You're coming with me.
<i>NO!!!</i> <i>No more.</i> Get yourselves up to reception one, once you're there, Mr Copper, try to find a way of transmitting an SOS.
Astrid, take this, powered up, it'll take out Host within 50 yards, but then it needs 60 seconds to recharge.
Rickston, take this...
I've pre-set it, just hold down that button, it'll open the doors. Do NOT lose it, got that?
Now go and open the next door.
Go on, go! All right!
Mr Copper, I need you fighting fit. Astrid, where's the power points? Under the comms.
When it's ready, that blue light comes on, there.
You're talking as if you're not coming with us.
I'm gonna find out what's on deck 31.
What if you meet a Host? Well, I'll just... have some fun!
Sounds like you do this kind of thing all the time.
Not by choice.
All I do is travel, that's what I am, just a traveller.
Imagine it!
No tax, no bills, no boss.
Just the open sky.
I'm sort of...
unemployed now.
I was thinking, that blue box is kind of small, but...
I could squeeze in it. Like a stowaway.
It's not always safe. So you need someone to take care of you.
I've got no-one back on Sto, no family. Just me.
So what d' you think?
Can I come with you?
Yeah. I'd like that, yeah.
Mr Frame, are you still with us?
It's the engines, sir. Final phase!
There's nothing more I can do, we've only eight minutes left.
Don't worry, I'll get there. But the bridge is sealed off!
Yeah, yeah! Working on it! I'll get there, Mr Frame. Somehow!
All charged up!
Mr Copper, look after her. Astrid, look after him.
Rickston, erm... Look after yourself.
And I'll see you again.
I promise. Hold on.
There's an old tradition on Planet Sto...
I have really got to go. Just wait a minute.
Yeah, that's a... very old tradition, yeah.
See you later.
Oh, yes.
Do it!
Wait, wait! Security Protocol One!
D' you hear me? One! One!
OK. That gives me three questions.
Three questions to save my life, am I right?
Information. Correct.
No, that wasn't one of them, I didn't mean it, that's not fair!
Can I start again? Information. No.
No, no, no, that wasn't a question either! Blimey.
One question left. One question.
So! You've been given orders to kill the survivors, but survivors must therefore be passengers or staff, but not me, I'm not a passenger, I'm not staff, go on, scan me, you must have bio-records, no such person on board, I don't exist, therefore, you can't kill me, therefore, I'm a stowaway, and stowaways should be arrested and taken to the nearest figure of authority, and I reckon the nearest figure of authority is on deck 31.
Final question  am I right?!
Information. Correct.
Brilliant!
Take me to your leader!
I've always wanted to say that.
Rickston, seal the doors, make the room secure.
Mr Copper, keep an eye on the Host, I need to check the computer, we need that SOS!
Bridge... this is Reception One.
Who's that? Astrid Peth  I was with the Doctor. Tell me, can you divert power to the teleport system?
No way. I'm using everything for the engines.
It's just one trip, I need to get to deck 31.
And I'm telling you, no!
<i>Mr Frame.</i> This is for the Doctor.
He's gone down there, on his own, and I...
I can't just leave him.
'He's done everything he can to save us... ' It's time we did something to help him.
'Giving you power.' Mr Copper. I'm going to find him.
Good luck.
Wow.
<i>Now...</i> that is what you'd call a fixer-upper.
Come on, then, Host with the most.
This ultimate authority of yours, who is it?
Oh, that's clever.
That's an Omnistate Impact Chamber.
Indestructible! You could survive anything, in there, you could sit through a supernova.
Or a shipwreck.
But only one person could have the power and the money to hide themselves on board like this.
And I should know, cos...
My name is Max.
It really does that?! Who the hell is this? I'm the Doctor, hello!
Information. Stowaway.
Well... Kill him.
Oh, no, no, no, no, wait!
<i>But you can't, not now, come on! Max!</i> You're giving me so much good material! Like...
how to get a head in business.
D' you see? Head? Head?
Head? No?
Ho, ho! The office joker.
I like a funny man.
No-one's been funny with me for years.
I can't think why.
176 years of running the company have taken their toll.
Yeah, but... nice wheels.
No. A life-support system, in a society that despises cyborgs.
I've had to hide away for years, running the company by hologram. Host!
Situation report!
Information. Titanic is still in orbit.
<i>Let me see...</i> We should've crashed by now, what's gone wrong?
The engines are still running, they should have stopped!
When they do, Earth gets roasted... What's Earth got to do with it?
This interview is terminated.
<i>No, no, no, no! But hold on, hold on, wait!</i> I can work it out, it's like a task, I'm your apprentice, just watch me...
<i>So!</i> The business is failing, you wreck the ship, that makes things even worse... Oh! Yes!
<i>No.</i> Yes!
The business isn't failing, it's failed, past tense!
My own board voted me out, stabbed me in the back.
If you had a back. So! You scupper the ship, wipe out any survivors, just in case anyone's rumbled you...
and the board find their shares halved in value.
Oh, but that's not enough!
No. Cos if a Max Capricorn ship hits the Earth, it destroys an entire planet...
Outrage back home, scandal!
The business is wiped out!
And... the whole board thrown in jail, for mass murder.
While you sit there, safe inside the Impact Chamber.
I have men waiting to retrieve me from the ruins, and enough off world accounts to retire me to the beaches of Penhaxico Two.
Where the ladies, so I'm told, are very fond of... metal.
So that's the plan.
A retirement plan!
2, 000 people on this ship, six billion underneath us, all of them slaughtered, and why?
Because Max Capricorn is a loser!
I never lose! You can't even sink the Titanic!
Oh, but I can, Doctor!
I can cancel the engines from here.
<i>'Engines closing.'</i> <i>No, no, no, no, no, no! NO!</i> 'Engines closing.' What's happening?
You can't do this! Host! Hold him!
Not so clever now, Doctor.
A shame we couldn't work together, you're rather good.
All that banter, yet not a word wasted.
Time for me to retire.
The Titanic is falling. The sky will burn.
Let the Christmas inferno commence.
Oh!
<i>Host...</i> kill him.
Mr Capricorn!
I resign.
Astrid, don't!
He's cut the brake line!
Astrid!
'Titanic falling. Voyage terminated. Voyage terminated.' Argh!
'Deadlock broken.' Midshipman Frame! At last!
<i>But the Host... Controller dead, they revert to the next highest authority. And that's me!</i> There's no power, the ship's gonna fall.
'Titanic falling.' What's your first name? Alonso.
'Titanic falling.' You're kidding me. Why?
That's something else I've always wanted to say.
Allons-y, Alonso!
Hello, yes, erm... Could you get me Buckingham Palace?
And as dawn rises over Great Britain, it seems that, this year, the City of London has escaped alien intervention...
The Queen has remained in residence, in defiance of extraterrestrial attack...
Listen to me! Security Code 7711, now get out of there!
Open the door!
Don't you dare, you aliens! Don't you dare!
'Engine active. Engine active.' Thank you, Doctor! Thank you! Happy Christmas.
Yes! Oh, yes!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Used the heat of re-entry to fire up the Secondary Storm Drive.
Unsinkable. That's me.
We made it.
Not all of us.
Teleport!
She was wearing a teleport bracelet!
Rickston! Sonic!
Mr Copper, the teleports, have they got an emergency setting?
I don't know, they should have. She fell, Mr Copper.
What's the emergency code? Let me... What the hell are you doing? We can bring her back!
If a passenger has an accident on shore leave and they're still wearing their teleport, their molecules are suspended and held in stasis, so if we can just trigger the shift. There!
I'm falling. Only halfway there. Come on!
<i>I keep falling. Feedback the molecule grid. Boost it with the restoration matrix. No, no, no!</i> Need more phase containment. Doctor... If I can just link up the surface suspension.
Doctor, she's gone. I just need to override the safety. I can do this, I can do it. Doctor.
Let her go.
I can do anything! Stop me falling.
There's not enough left, the system was too badly damaged.
She's just atoms, Doctor.
An echo, with the ghost of consciousness.
She's stardust.
Astrid Peth. Citizen of Sto.
The woman who looked at the stars and dreamt of travelling.
There's an old tradition.
Now you can travel forever.
You're not falling, Astrid. You're flying.
The engines have stabilised, we're holding steady till we get help and I've sent the SOS.
A rescue ship should be here within twenty minutes.
And they're digging out the records on Max Capricorn. Should be quite a story.
They'll want to talk to all of us, I suppose? I'd have thought so, yeah.
I think one or two inconvenient truths might come to light.
Still, it's my own fault.
And ten years in jail is better than dying.
<i>Doctor...</i> I never said...
thank you.
The funny thing is...
... I said Max Capricorn was falling apart.
Just before the crash, I sold all my shares.
Transferred them to his rivals.
It's made me rich. What do you think of that?
 Salvain? Those shares, I want them triple-bonded and locked...
Of all the people to survive, he's not the one you would have chosen, is he?
But if you could choose, Doctor, if you could decide who lives and who dies...
... that would make you a monster.
<i>Mr Copper...</i> I think you deserve one of these.
So, Great Britain is part of Yooropee, and just across the British Channel, you've got Great France and Great Germany.
No, no, it's just France and Germany, only Britain is Great.
And they're all at war with the continent of Hamerica?
No. Well, not yet. You could argue that one. There she is!
Survive anything!
You know, between you and me, I don't even think this snow is real, I think it's the ballast from the Titanic's salvage entering the atmosphere.
Yeah. One of these days, it might snow for real.
So! I suppose you'll be off?
The open sky.
And... what about me?
I travel alone. It's best that way.
What am I supposed to do?
Give me that credit card.
Well, it's just petty cash.
Spending money.
It's all done by computer, I didn't really know the currency so I thought a million might cover it.
A million? Pounds?
Enough for trinkets.
Mr Copper, a million pounds is worth 50 million credits.
How much?! 50 million and 56.
<i>I've got money.</i> Yes, you have!
Oh, my word.
Oh, my Vot. Oh, my goodness me!
Yee-hah!
It's all yours. Planet Earth. Now, that's a retirement plan.
Just you be careful, though! I will, I will, oh, I will!
No interfering. I don't want any trouble. Just... just have a nice life.
But I can have a house!
A proper house! With a garden!
And a door!
Oh, Doctor! I will make you proud!
I can have a kitchen! With chairs! And windows! And plates! And...
Um... where are you going?
I've no idea!
No, me neither.
Oh, and Doctor!
I won't forget her.
Merry Christmas, Mr Copper.
Come with me.

(DOCTOR WHO THEME) (PHONE RINGING) RECEPTIONIST: Good morning, Adipose Industries.
(DEVICE WHIRRING) Donna Noble, Health and Safety.
John Smith, Health and Safety.
Adipose Industries, the 21st century way to lose weight.
No exercise, no diet, no pain, just lifelong freedom from fat, the holy grail of the modern age.
And here it is.
You just take one capsule, one capsule, once a day for three weeks, and the fat, as they say...
MALE ANNOUNCER: The fat just walks away.
Excuse me, Miss Foster, if I could?
I'm Penny Carter, science correspondent for the Observer.
There are a thousand diet pills on the market, a thousand conmen stealing people's money.
How do we know the fat isn't going straight into your bank account?
Oh, Penny, if cynicism burnt off calories, we'd all be as thin as rakes.
But if you want the science, I can oblige.
MALE ANNOUNCER: Adipose Industries.
The Adipose capsule is composed of a synthesised, mobilising lipase, bound to a large protein molecule.
The mobilising lipase breaks up the triglycerides stored in the adipose cells, which then enter...
Health and Safety.
Film Department.
100% legal, 100% effective.
But can I just ask, how many people have taken the pills to date?
We've already got 1,000,000 customers within the Greater London area alone, but from next week, we start rolling out nationwide.
The future starts here.
And Britain will be thin.
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries...
That's a three-week course of pills for the special price of £45.
Donna Noble from Health and Safety. Don't mind me.
We deliver within three working days...
John Smith, Health and Safety. Don't mind me.
The box comes with 21 days’ worth of pills, a full information pack and our special free gift, an Adipose Industries pendant.
It's made of 18 carat gold and it's yours for free.
No, we don't give away pens. Sorry.
No. I can't make an exception. No.
I'll just need to keep this for testing, and I just need a list of your customers.
~Could you print it off?
I suppose so.
Where's the printer?
Just over there, by the plant.
Which plant? That plant?
Yeah, that's the one.
Lovely.
That's the printer there?
By the plant, yeah. Brilliant.
Does it need a code? Last place I worked, the printer needed a code.
No, I can do it from here.
Has it got paper?
Yeah, Jimbo keeps it stocked.
Excuse me, everyone, if I could have your attention...
On average, you're each selling 4@ Adipose packs per day.
That's not enough.
I want 100 sales per person per day.
And if not, you'll be replaced.
‘Cause if anyone's good at trimming the fat, it's me.
Now, back to it.
Anyway, if you could print that off, thanks.
So, if you could just print off that list, I'll get out of your way.
Lovely. Thanks, then. See you.
Thanks, then. Oh. What's that?
My telephone number.
What for?
Health and Safety. You be Health, I'll be Safety.
Oh, ah...
But that contravenes paragraph 5, subsection C. Sorry.
Me again.
Stacy Campbell?
Who wants to know?
Uh, my name's Donna. I represent Adipose Industries.
And you're on the list of our valued customers.
Mr Roger Davey, I'm calling on behalf of Adipose Industries.
Just need to ask you a few questions.
It's been fantastic. I started the pills on Thursday.
Five days later, I've lost 11 pounds.
And no side effects or anything?
No, I feel fantastic. It's a new lease of life.
Now, what do you think about these earrings? Do they work?
Yeah, lovely.
I've been on the pills two weeks now. I've lost 14 kilos, That's the same amount every day?
One kilo exactly.
You wake up, and it's disappeared overnight.
Well, technically speaking, it's gone by 1:10 in the morning.
What makes you say that?
That's when I get woken up.
Might as well weigh myself at the same time.
You going on a date?
I'm doing the opposite. I'm dumping him. I can do better than him now.
Right, I won't be long. If the taxi beeps, give me a shout.
It is driving me mad.
Ten minutes past 1:00, every night, bang on the dot, without fail, the burglar alarm goes off.
I've had experts in, I've had it replaced, I've even phoned Watchdog.
But no, 1:10 in the morning, off it goes.
But with no burglar?
Nothing. I've given up looking.
Tell me, Roger, have you got a cat flap?
It was here when I bought the house. I never bothered with it really.
I'm not a cat person.
No, I've met cat people. You're nothing like them.
Is that what it is, though, cats getting inside the house?
Well, thing about cat flaps is they don't just let things in, they let things out as well.
Like what?
"The fat just walks away.” Won't be long.
Oh, that's all right.
(STOMACH GROWLING) Oh.
(STOMACH GURGLING) (ALARM SOUNDING) We have unscheduled parthenogenesis.
Well, thanks for your help.
Tell you what, maybe you could lay off the pills for a week or so.
(BEEPING) Gotta go! Sorry!
Send out the collection squad. Bring them home.
Oh!
You all right out there?
Yeah.
(CREATURE SQUEALING) The adipose has been witnessed.
FOSTER: Activating full parthenogenesis.
(GURGLING) What?
(CREATURE SQUEALING) What are you?
What are you?
I like what you done with the hall.
Stacy?
(GURGLING) You all right?
Wouldn't mind a little visit myself.
Everything all right in there?
(STACY SOBBING) It's only me.
Do you mind if I pop to the loo?
Stacy?
Oh, help me! Oh, my God, help me!
What is it? What's wrong?
Stacy!
(SCREAMING) (POUNDING ON DOOR) (SQUEAKING) (CREATURES GURGLING) (CRASHING) (CREATURES CRYING) (DEVICE WHIRRING) Stacy Campbell?
No, she's gone.
Gone where?
She's just gone.
Oh, great. Thanks for nothing.
So, it seems we have a case of industrial espionage.
One touch and the capsule bio-tunes itself to its owner, but someone must have introduced a second, raw capsule.
Therefore, one of these people is a thief.
There.
Oh, yes, there she is.
Now...
What should we do with her?
And what time's this?
How old am I?
Not old enough to use a phone.
I thought you were only moving back for a couple of weeks.
Look at you.
I mean, you're never gonna find a flat, not while you're on the dole.
It's no good sitting there dressed-up, looking like you're job-hunting.
You've got to do something.
It's not like the 1980s, no one's unemployed these days, except you.
How long did that job with Health and Safety last?
Two days, and then you walk out.
“I have other plans.” Well, I've not seen them.
And it's no good sitting there dreaming.
No one's gonna come along with a magic wand and make your life all better.
Where's Granddad?
Where do you think he is?
Up the hill. He's always up the hill.
Aye, aye, here comes trouble.
Permission to board ship, sir.
Permission granted.
Was she nagging you?
(LAUGHING) Big time, I brought you a Thermos.
Oh, ta.
You seen anything?
Yeah, I've got Venus.
Yeah, with an apparent magnitude of minus 3.5 at least.
That's what it says in my little book. Here, have a seat. Come on. Here you go.
You all right?
That's the only planet in the solar system named after a woman.
Good for her.
How far away is that?
Oh, it's about 26,000,000 miles.
But we'll get there one day.
100 years’ time, we'll be striding out amongst the stars, jiggling about with all them aliens, just you wait.
You really believe in all that stuff, don't you?
Oh, they're all over the place these days.
If I wait here long enough...
I don't suppose you've seen a little blue box.
Is that slang for something?
No, I mean it.
If you ever see a little blue box flying up there in the sky, you shout for me, Gramps.
Oh, you just shout.
Do you know, I don't understand half the things you say these days.
Nor me.
No, fair dues.
You've had a funny old time of it lately.
There was poor old whatshisname, Lance, bless him.
That barmy old Christmas.
I wish you'd tell us what really happened.
I know.
It's just...
The things I've seen, sometimes I think I'm going mad.
I mean, even tonight, I was in a...
Doesn't matter.
Well, you're not yourself, I'll give you that.
You just... You seem to be drifting, sweetheart.
I'm not drifting.
I'm waiting.
What for?
The right man.
(LAUGHING) Same old story! A man!
Oh, I don't mean like that.
But he's real. I've seen him.
I've met him, just once.
And then I let him fly away.
Well, there you are. Go and find him. I've tried.
He's nowhere.
Hey, not like you to give up.
You know, I remember when you was about six years old, your mother said, “No holiday this year.” So off you toddled all on your own and you got on a bus to Strathclyde.
Hah! We had the police out and everything.
Hah! Where's she gone, then?
Where's that girl, eh?
You're right.
‘Cause he's still out there, somewhere.
And I'll find him, Gramps, even if I have to wait 100 years.
I'll find him.
Oh, fascinating.
Seems to be a bio-flip digital stitch specifically for...
It's my turn for the car. What do you need it for?
A quick getaway.
(WHOOSHING) Morning.
Keep an eye out. She'll come back.
And then she's mine.
See you tomorrow.
Night.
(MOBILE RINGING) (WHISPERING) Not now.
I need the car. Where are you?
I can't. I'm busy.
Why are you whispering?
I'm in church.
What are you doing in church?
Praying.
Hal Bit late for that, madam.
What's she in church for?
Hush, you. Go up the hill.
But I need the car. I'm going out with Suzette.
She's asked all the Wednesday girls.
Apparently, she's been on those Adipose pills.
She says she looks marvellous.
(CRASHING) We know you're in here, so why don't you make this nice and easy and show yourself?
I'm waiting.
I warn you, I'm not a patient woman. Now, out you come.
Right.
We'll do it the hard way.
Get her.
There you are.
I've been through the records, Foster, and all of your results have been faked.
There's something about those pills you're not telling us.
Oh, I think I'll be conducting this interview, Penny.
You've got no right to do this. Let me go.
This is ridiculous.
Sit there, I'm phoning my editor.
I said, sit.
PENNY: You can't tie me up.
What sort of a country do you think this is?
Oh, it's a beautifully fat country.
And believe me, I've travelled a long way to find obesity on this scale.
So, come on then, Miss Foster, those pills, what are they?
Well, you might as well have a scoop, since you'll never see it printed.
This is the spark of life.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Officially, the capsule attracts all the fat cells and flushes them away.
Well, it certainly attracts them, that part's true.
But it binds the fat together and galvanises it to form a body.
What do you mean, a body?
I am surprised you never asked about my name.
I chose it well.
Foster.
As in "foster mother".
And these are my children.
PENNY: Are you kidding me? I don't... What the hell is that?
Adipose.
It's called an adipose, made out of living fat.
PENNY: I don’t understand. FOSTER: From ordinary human people.
(MOUTHS) Are we interrupting you?
Get her!
And him!
What about me?
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it!
You've even got the same suit!
Don't you ever change?
Yeah, thanks, Donna, not right now.
Just like old times.
DONNA: ‘Cause I thought, “How do you find the Doctor?" And then I just thought, “Look for trouble, and then he'll turn up.” So looked everywhere, you name it.
UFO sightings, crop circles, sea monsters.
I looked, I found them all.
That song about the bees disappearing, I thought, “I bet he's connected.” ‘Cause the thing is, Doctor, I believe it all now.
You opened my eyes to all those amazing things out there.
I believe them all. Well, apart from that replica of the Titanic flying over Buckingham Palace on Christmas Day.
That's got to be a hoax!
What do you mean, the bees are disappearing?
I don't know. That's what it says on the Internet.
On the same site, there was all these conspiracy theories about Adipose Industries, and I thought, “Let's take a look.” In you get!
What, in that thing?
Yes, “in that thing”.
But if we go down in that, they'll just call us back up again.
No, no, I locked the controls with a sonic cage.
I'm the only one that can control it.
Not unless she's got a sonic device of her own, which is very unlikely.
Out of my way.
FOSTER: Oh.
Oh, I don't think so.
(BOTH YELLING) Hold on! Hold on, we can go in through the window.
Deadlock the building.
I can't get it open!
Smash it, then!
She's cutting the cable!
(DONNA SCREAMING) Donna!
Doctor!
Hold on!
Tam!
Doctor!
FOSTER: And now for the other one.
I'm gonna fall!
What the hell is going on?
This is all your fault.
I should have stayed at home.
I won't be a minute.
Yes, he's slippery, that one.
Time we found out who he is.
Is anyone going to tell me what's going on?
What are you, a journalist? Yes.
Well, make it up!
Get off!
I've got you, I've got you. Donna, stop kicking!
I was right. It's always like this with you, isn't it?
Oh, yes. And off we go!
Oi!
Sorry.
Now do yourself a favour. Get out!
FOSTER: Well, then.
At last.
Hello.
Nice to meet you. I'm the Doctor.
And I'm Donna.
Partners in crime, And evidently off-worlders, judging by your sonic technology.
Oh, yes. I've still got your sonic pen.
Nice. I like it. Sleek.
It's kind of sleek.
Oh, it's definitely sleek.
And if you were to sign your real name, that would be...?
Matron Cofelia of the Five-Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet.
Intergalactic class.
A wet nurse.
Using humans as surrogates.
I've been employed by the Adiposian First Family to foster a new generation after their breeding planet was lost.
What do you mean, lost? How do you lose a planet?
Oh, the politics are none of my concern.
I'm just here to take care of the children on behalf of the parents.
What, like an outer space super-nanny?
Yes, if you like.
So...
So those little things, they're made out of fat, yeah?
But that woman, Stacy Campbell, there was nothing left of her.
Oh, in a crisis, the adipose can convert bone and hair and internal organs.
It makes them a little bit sick, poor things.
What about poor Stacy?
Seeding a level five planet is against galactic law.
Are you threatening me?
I'm trying to help you, Matron.
This is your one chance.
‘Cause if you don't call this off, then I'll have to stop you.
I hardly think you can stop bullets.
No, hold on, hold on, hold on! One more thing, before dying.
Do you know what happens if you hold two identical sonic devices against each other?
No.
Nor me. Let's find out.
Come on!
I'm advancing the birth plan. We're going into premature labour.
Cellular basification.
Tie her up.
Oh, you're kidding me.
Well, that's one solution, hiding in a cupboard.
I like it.
Been hacking into this thing all day ‘cause the Matron's got a computer core running through the centre of the building. Triple-deadlocked.
But now I've got this, I can get into it.
What does that thing do?
It's the inducer.
We had planned to seed millions, but if that man's an alien, then he's alerted the Shadow Proclamation.
So the first 1,000,000 humans will have to do.
Find him.
And the woman. Don't waste time, just kill them.
She's wired up the whole building.
We need a bit of privacy.
(GUARDS SCREAMING) Just enough to stop them.
Why has she wired up a tower block?
What's it all for?
COMPUTER: Inducer online.
You look older.
Thanks.
Still on your own?
Yeah.
Well, no. I had this friend. Martha she was called.
Martha Jones. She was brilliant.
And I destroyed half her life.
But she's fine, she's good.
She's gone.
What about Rose?
Still lost.
I thought you were going to travel the world, Easier said than done.
It's like I had that one day with you, and I was going to change.
I was going to do so much.
Then I woke up the next morning...
Same old life.
It's like you were never there.
And I tried... did try.
I went to Egypt. I was going to go barefoot and everything.
And then it's all bus trips and guidebooks and “Don't drink the water" and two weeks later you're back home.
It's nothing like being with you.
I must have been mad turning down that offer.
What offer?
To come with you.
Come with me?
Oh, yes, please!
Right.
COMPUTER: Inducer activated.
What's it doing now?
She's started the programme.
COMPUTER: Inducer transmitting.
Mark the date, Miss Carter.
Happy birthday.
1,000,000 birthdays.
I swear, that Adipose treatment is fabulous.
Just look at my chin.
And it's very good for back fat. I'm down two sizes.
It's like a miracle. All that from just one little pill.
And I've been eating like normal...
(GURGLING) You all right, love?
Yeah, I'm...
Just...
Funny sort of feeling, like something...
I'm not sure, it just seems to be...
Better pop to the loo.
Oh, my God! Suzette...
What?
What is it?
Get it off me!
(SQUEALS PLAYFULLY) (SQUEALING) Come to me, children.
Come to me.
WOMAN: Get back. Everyone get back. Don't touch them.
Keep away...
Just leave them.
So far they're just losing weight, but the Matron’s gone up to emergency parthenogenesis.
And that's when they convert...
Skeletons, organs, everything.
1,000,000 people are going to die.
I've got to cancel the signal.
This contains the primary signal.
If I can switch it off, the fat goes back to being just fat.
Oh, nice try.
Double strength.
COMPUTER: Inducer increasing.
No, no, no! She's doubled it! I need...
I haven't got time. It's too far. I can't override it.
They're all going to die.
Is there anything I can do?
Sorry, Donna, this is way beyond you.
I've got to double the base pulse. I can't...
Doctor, tell me, what do you need?
I need a second capsule to boost the override, but I've only got the one. I can't save them.
It's stopped.
They've gone.
What's happened?
I think the Doctor happened.
We've still given birth to 10,000 adipose.
(LOUD ELECTRONIC HUMMING) And the Nursery's coming.
(LOUD ELECTRONIC HUMMING) What the hell is that?
It's my lift home.
You can’t just leave me here.
It just stopped.
(LOUD ELECTRONIC HUMMING) What on Earth is it now?
(PEOPLE SCREAMING) (MUSIC PLAYING FROM EARPHONES) Wait a minute, When you say “nursery”, you don't mean a créche in Notting Hill.
Nursery ship.
COMPUTER: Incoming signal.
(VOICE ON COMPUTER SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Hadn't we better go and stop them?
Hold on, hold on.
Instructions from the Adiposian First Family.
Children.
Oh, my children behold.
Tam taking you home.
(ADIPOSIANS CHEERING) Far across the galaxy, your new mummies and daddies are waiting, and you will fly...
Up you go, babies.
Up you go.
That's it. Fly away home.
She's wired up the tower block to convert it into a levitation post...
Ooh!
Oh!
We're not the ones in trouble now.
She is!
Take me. The children need me.
What are you gonna do, then?
Blow ‘em up?
They're just children. They can't help where they came from.
Oh, well, that makes a change from last time.
That Martha must have done you good.
Yeah, she did. Yeah. Yeah.
She did.
She fancied me.
Mad Martha, that one.
Blind Martha. Charity Martha.
(SQUEALING HAPPILY) I'm waving at fat.
Actually, as a diet plan, it sort of works, There she is!
Matron Cofelia, listen to me!
No, I don't think so, Doctor.
And if I never see you again, it'll be too soon, Why does no one ever listen?
I'm trying to help! Just get across to the roof.
Can you shift the levitation beam?
What, so that you can arrest me?
Just listen. I saw the Adiposian instructions.
They know it's a crime, breeding on Earth, so what's the one thing they want to get rid of?
Their accomplice.
I'm far more than that.
I'm nanny to all these children.
Exactly. Mum and Dad have got the kids now.
They don't need the nanny any more.
(FOSTER SCREAMING) PENNY: Oi! You two!
You're just mad! Do you hear me?
Mad! And I'm going to report you for...
Madness!
Some people just can't take it.
No.
And some people can.
So then, Tardis.
Come on!
That's my car!
That is like destiny.
And I've been ready for this. I packed ages ago, just in case.
‘Cause I thought, “Hot weather.
"Cold weather.
"No weather.
"He goes anywhere. I've got to be prepared.” You've got a... A hatbox.
Planet of the hats, I'm ready!
I don't need injections, do 1?
You know like when you go to Cambodia, is there any of that?
‘Cause my friend Veena went to Bahrain and she...
You're not saying much.
No, it's just...
It's a funny old life, in the Tardis.
You don't want me.
I'm not saying that.
But you asked me.
Would you rather be on your own?
No.
Actually, no.
But...
The last time, with Martha, like I said, it...
It got complicated.
And that was all my fault. I...
I just want a mate.
You just want to mate!
I just want “a" mate.
You're not mating with me, sunshine!
"A" mate. I want "a" mate.
Well, just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense.
I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing.
You know, alien nothing.
There we are, then.
Okay.
I can come?
Yeah.
Of course you can, yeah.
I'd love it.
That's just...
Car keys.
What?
I've still got my mum's car keys. I won't be a minute.
I know, Mum, I saw it. Little fat people.
Listen, I've got to go. I'm going to stay with Veena for a bit.
But it was in the sky...
Yeah, know. Spaceship.
But I've still got the car keys.
Look, there's a bin on Brook Street about 30 feet from the corner.
I'm going to leave them in there.
What? A bin?
Yes, I said "bin".
But you can't do that!
Now, stop complaining. The car's just down the road a bit.
Gotta go. Really got to go.
Bye.
But, Donna, you can't...
Listen, there's this woman who's going to come along, a tall, blonde woman called Sylvia.
Tell her, "That bin there." All right? It will make sense. “That bin there." Off we go, then.
Here it is, the Tardis.
It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside...
Oh, I know all that bit.
Although, frankly, you could turn the heating up.
So...
Whole wide universe.
Where do you want to go?
Oh, I know exactly the place.
Which is?
Two and a half miles that way.
Ah! Donna, it’s... It's the flying blue box!
That's Donna!
That's Donna.
And that's him. That's him!
Yay! That's him!
Go on, girl! Go on, get out there!
Hey!
Ancient Rome!
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Ancient Rome.
Well, not to them, obviously.
To all intents and purposes, right now, this is Brand New Rome.
Oh, my God, it's...
It's so Roman!
This is fantastic.
I'm here, in Rome, Donna Noble, in Rome.
This is just weird.
 I mean, everyone here's dead  Well, don't tell THEM that.
Hold on a minute, that sign over there's in English.
Are you having me on, are we in Epcot?
No, no no, it's TARDIS translation circuits, it looks like English Speech as well,  you're talking Latin right now  Seriously?
 I just said 'seriously' in Latin.
 Yeah.
What if I said something in actual Latin?
Like, 'Veni, vidi, vici'? My dad said that coming back from the football.
If I said, 'Veni, vidi, vici' to that lot, what would it sound like?
I'm not sure. You do think of difficult questions.
I'm gonna try it.
Afternoon, sweetheart, what can I get you, my love?
Erm... Veni, vidi, vici.
Ah? Sorry?
Me-no-speak-Celtic. No-can-do, missy.
Yeah.
 How's he mean, Celtic?
 Welsh You sound Welsh.
There we are, learnt something, hm?
Don't our clothes look a bit odd?
Naaah. Ancient Rome, anything goes.
It's like Soho, but bigger.
 Have you been here before, then?
 Mm.
Ages ago.
And that fire had nothing to do with me.
Well... a bit. But I haven't got the chance to look around properly.
The Colosseum. The Pantheon.
The Circus Maximus...
You'd expect them to be looming by now.
Where is everything?
Try this one.
Support us and become VIP member  to remove all ads from www. OpenSubtitles. org I'm not expert, but there's SEVEN hills of Rome, aren't there?
How come they've only got one?
Here we go again!
Wait a minute...
One mountain.
With smoke.
 Which makes this...
 Pompeii.
We're in Pompeii And it's volcano day.
Doctor Who 4x02 Fires of Pompeii Subtitles by www. doctorwho. scifi-guide. net English subs: luxbella, Sanju I beg audience with the High Priestess of the Sibylline.
The High Priestess cannot be seen.
 What would you tell her, sister?
 It has come.
As foretold in the prophecy.
The box.
The blue box.
You're kidding.
 You're not telling me the TARDIS has gone?
 OK.
Where is it, then?
You told me not to tell you.
 0i. Don't get clever in Latin. Hold on.
'Scuse me, 'scuse me, there was a box, big blue box, big blue wooden box, over there, where is it gonne?
 I sold it, didn't I?
 But...
 It wasn't yours to sell!
 It was on my patch, weren't it?
I got 15 sesterce for it, lovely jubbly.
 Who did you sell it to?
 Old Caecilius. Look, if you want to argue, why don't you take it out with him?
He's on Foss Street, big villa, can't miss it.
Thanks.
What did he buy a big blue wooden box for?
Modern art!
Out of the way, thats it.
Oh, Rhombus, I'm a little bit peckish, get me some ants in honey, good lad.
Ooh, maybe a dormouse?
What d'you think?
You call it modern art.
I call it a blooming great waste of space.
But we're going up in the world, my love.
Lucius Dextrus himself is coming here. This afternoon.
What with that, and our Evelina about to be elevated...
Oh, don't go on about it, Dad!
If we'd moved to Rome, as I said, she could have been a Vestal Virgin.
 Someone mention Vestal Virgins?
 Quintus, don't be so rude.
You apologise to the household gods!
 Get off.
 Apologise, right now!
The gods are always watching.
Positions!
There, now you've made the Heavens angry.
Just say sorry.
I tell you, Caecilius, that boy will come to no good.
Sorry, household gods.
So where were you last night? Down the thermopolium, I bet?
Cavorting with Etruscans and  Christians and all sorts.
How's your head, sunshine? How's your head?
All right, Dad, give us a break!
You want to smarten yourself up, Quintus.
Before Lucius Dextrus gets here.
Look at your sister, she's giving us... status.
Oh, yeah, cos it's all about Evelina.
She has the gift. Be proud of your sister, for once.
 Have you been consuming?
 Not this morning.
Well, come on, sweetheart. Practise!
Oh, it's hot today, the hypocaust is on full blast.
The Mountain God must be happy.
Breathe deeply. Remember what the Sisterhood said.
 It hurts.
 Oh, my love, is it too hot?
Sometimes, in the smoke...
 I see the most terrible things.
 Like what?
A face.
A face of stone.
It'll make sense. One day.
Sister Spurrina promised.
The veil will be parted, and you'll be a seer.
Who are you?
Ah, I've got it! Foss Street, this way!
No, but I found this big sort of amphitheatre thing, we could gather everyone together there, then we could ring a big bell...
 They got bells yet?
 What d'you want a bell for?
To warn everyone.
Start the evacuation.
What time does Vesuvius erupt?
It's 79AD, 23rd of August, which makes Volcano Day... tomorrow.
Plenty of time to get everyone out, easy.
Yeah, except we're not going to.
But that's what you do, Doctor, you save people!
Not this time. Pompeii is a fixed point in history.
What happens, happens. There is no stopping it.
 Says who?
 Says me.
What, and you're in charge?
TARDIS, Time Lord, yeah!
Donna, Human, no!
I don't need your permission! I'm telling myself!
You stand here announcing the end, they'll just think you're a mad old soothsayer!
Now, come on. TARDIS.  We are getting out of here.
I might just have something to say about that, spaceman!
Oh, I bet you will!
The tall one.
He calls us mad.
Then he is a stranger to Pompeii.
Soon, he will learn.
We have found it, Sister Spurrina.
In the Thirteenth Book of the Sibylline Oracles.
The blue box.
A temple made of wood.
And yet, the Sibyl foretold that the box would appear at the time of storms and fire and betrayal.
Sisters!
Reverend Mother, you should sleep.
The Sibylline Oracles are wrong.
But we have venerated her words for generations.
This is a new age.
Heed my words.
I predict a future of prosperity and might.
An endless Empire of Pompeii, reaching out from this city to topple Rome itself, and encompass the whole wide world.
If the disciples of the blue box defy this prophecy, their blood will run across the Temple floor.
The gods approve.
Positions!
There you go.
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm afraid business is closed for the day. I'm expecting a visitor.
That's me. I'm a visitor. Hello.
 Who are you?
 I am...
Spartacus.
And so am I.
Mr and Mrs Spartacus?
 0h, no, we're not married.
 We're not together.
0h, brother and sister?
Yes, of course! You look very much alike.
 Really?
 Really?
I'm sorry, but I'm not open for trading.
 And that trade would be?
 Marble.
Lobus Caecilius.
Mining, polishing and design thereof.
 If you want marble, I'm your man.
 That's good, cos...
I'm the marble inspector.
By the gods of Commerce, an inspection!
I'm sorry, sir. I do apologise for my son.
This is my good wife, Metella.
 I confess, we're not prepared...
 Don't worry.
I'm sure you've nothing to hide. Although, frankly, THAT object...
 looks rather like wood to me.
 I told you to get rid of it.
I only bought it today!
Ah, well... Caveat emptor.
Oh, you're Celtic. There's lovely.
I'm sure it's fine, but I might have to take it off your hands, for a proper inspection.
While we're here, would you recommend a holiday, Spartacus?
Don't know what you mean, Spartacus.
Well, this lovely family. Mother and father and son.
Don't you think they should get out of town?
 Why should we do that?
 Well, the volcano, for start.
 What?
 The volcano.
 The WHAT-ano?
 That great big volcano right on your doorstep...
Oh, Spartacus, for shame, we haven't even greeted the household gods yet.
They don't know what it is. Vesuvius is just a mountain to them, the top hasn't blown off yet.
The Romans haven't even got a word for volcano.
Not until tomorrow.
Oh, great, they can learn a new word.
 As they die.
 Donna, stop it.
Whatever sort of kids you've been flying round with, don't tell me to shut up.
That boy, how old is he? Sixteen?
 And tomorrow, he burns to death.
 And that's my fault?
Right now, yes.
Announcing Lucius Petrus Dextrus, Chief Augur of the City Government.
Lucius. My pleasure, as always.
Quintus, stand up!
A rare and great honour, sir, for you to come to my house...
The birds are flying north, and the wind is in the west.
Quite. Absolutely.
That's good, is it?
 Only the grain of wheat knows where it will grow.
 There now, Metella.
 Have you ever heard SUCH wisdom?
 Never.
It's an honour.
Pardon me, sir, I have guests, this is Spartacus and... Spartacus.
A name is but a cloud upon a summer wind.
But the wind is felt most keenly in the dark.
But what is the dark,  other than an omen of the sun?
 I concede that every sun must set...
 And yet the son of the father must also rise.
 Damn.
Very clever, sir.
Evidently, a man of learning.
Oh, yes. But don't mind me, don't want to disturb the status quo.
He's Celtic.
 We'll be off in a minute.
 I'm not going.
It's ready, sir.
 You've got to.
 Well, I'm not.
The moment of revelation.
And here it is! Exactly as you've specified.
 It pleases you, sir?
 As the rain pleases the soil.
Oh, now that's... different. Who designed that, then?
My Lord Lucius was very specific.
 Where did you get the pattern?
 On the rain and mist and wind.
 But that looks like a circuit.
 Made of stone.
D'you mean you just dreamt that thing up?
That is my job. As City Augur.
What's that, then, like the mayor?
Oh! You must excuse my friend. She's from Barcelona.
But this is an age of superstition, of OFFICIAL superstition.
The Augur is paid by the city to tell the future.
"The wind will blow from the west", that's their Ten O'Clock News.
They're laughing at us.
Those two use words like tricksters, they're mocking us.
No, no, no. I meant no offence.
I'm sorry, my daughter's been consuming the vapours.
By the gods, mother, what have you been doing?
 Not now, Quintus.
 But she's sick, just look at her!
I gather I have a rival in this household.
Another with the gift.
Oh, she's been promised to the Sibylline Sisterhood.
They say she has remarkable visions.
The prophecies of women are limited and dull, only the menfolk have the capacity for true perception.
I'll tell you where the wind's  blowing right now, mate.
The Mountain God marks your words.
I'd be careful, if I were you.
 Consuming the vapours, you said?
 They give me strength.
 It doesn't look like it to me.
 Is that your opinion...
 as a doctor?
 I beg your pardon?
Doctor, that's your name.
 How did you know that?
 And YOU...
You call yourself Noble.
Now then, Evelina, don't be rude.
No, no, no, no, let her talk.
You both come from so far away.
The female soothsayer is inclined to invent all sorts of vagaries.
0h, not this time, Lucius.
No, I reckon you've been out-soothsayed.
Is that so...
 man from Gallifrey?
 What?
The strangest of images...
Your home is lost in fire, is it not?
Doctor, what are they doing?
 And you, daughter of... London.
 How does he know that?
This is the gift of Pompeii.
Every single oracle tells the truth.
 That's impossible.
 Doctor...
she is returning.
Who is? Who's she?
And you, daughter of London...
there is something on your back.
What's that mean?
Even the word 'doctor' is false.
Your real name is hidden.
It burns in the stars, in the  Cascade of Medusa herself.
You are a Lord, sir.
A Lord of Time.
Evelina!
She didn't mean to be rude, she's ever such a good girl.
But when the gods speak through her...
 What's wrong with her arm?
 An irritation of the skin.
She never complains, bless her.
We bathe it in olive oil every night.
What is it?
Evelina said you'd come from far away.
Please, have you ever seen anything like it?
It's stone.
 Different sort of hypocaust.
 Oh, yes.
We're very advanced in Pompeii.
In Rome, they're still using the old wood-burning furnaces.
But we've got hot springs,  leading from Vesuvius itself.
 Who thought of that?
 The soothsayers.
After the great earthquake, 17 years ago.
An awful lot of damage.
But we rebuilt.
Didn't you think of moving away?
No, then again, San Francisco...
That's a little restaurant in... Naples, isn't it?
 What's that noise?
 Don't know.
Happens all the time.
They say the gods of the Underworld are stirring.
But after the earthquake, let me guess...
 is that when the soothsayers started making sense?
 Oh, yes, very much so.
I mean, they'd always been, shall we say, imprecise?
But then the soothsayers, the augurs, the haruspex, all of them, they saw the truth, again and again.
It's quite amazing.
They predict crops and rainfall with absolute precision.
Have they said anything about tomorrow?
No.
Why, should they? Why d'you ask?
No, no, no reason. Just asking.
But the soothsayers, they all consume the vapours, yeah?
That's how they see.
Ipso facto...
Look you...
 They're all consuming this.
 Dust?
Tiny particles of rock.
They're breathing in Vesuvius.
Quintus, me old son.
This Lucius Petrus Dextrus, where does he live?
It's nothing to do with me.
Let me try again.
This Lucius Petrus Dextrus...
Where does he live?
Don't tell my dad.
Only if you don't tell mine.
Pass me that torch.
The liar!
He told my father it was the only one.
Well, plenty of marble merchants in this town.
Tell them all the same, get all the components from different places, so no-one can see what it is.
 Which is what?
 The future.
Doctor, we are building the future.
As dictated by the gods.
You're not supposed to laugh. Thanks for that.
What d'you think?
The Goddess Venus.
That's sacrilege.
Nice to see you laugh, though.
What d'you do in old Pompeii, then, girls of your age?
You got... mates? D'you go hanging about round the shops?
TK Maximus?
I am promised to the Sisterhood for life.
 D'you get any choice in that?
 It's not my decision.
The Sisters chose for me. I have the gift of sight.
Then...
 What can you see happening tomorrow?
 Is tomorrow special?
You tell me.
What do you see?
The sun will rise. The sun will set.
Nothing special at all.
Look, don't tell the Doctor I said anything cos he'll kill me, but I've got a prophecy too.
Evelina, I'm sorry, but you've got to hear me out.
 Sisters!
 Evelina, can you hear me?
Listen...
There is only one prophecy.
But everything I'm about to  say to you is true. I swear.
just listen to me.
Tomorrow, that mountain is gonna explode.
Evelina, please listen.
The air is gonna fill with ash and rocks, tons and tons of it, and this whole town is gonna get buried. That's not true.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
 But everyone's going to die.
 A new prophecy!
Impossible. There is only one.
Even if you don't believe me,  tell your family to get out of town.
Just for one day, just for tomorrow. But you've got to get out.
 You've got to leave Pompeii!
 This is false prophecy.
The noblewoman.
She spoke of a new prophecy, the fall of Pompeii.
Pompeii will last forever.
 Then what must we do?
 The False Prophet must die.
Sacrifice her!
Put this one... there.
This one...
there.
Er, keep that one upside down, what have you got?
 Enlighten me.
 What, the soothsayer doesn't know?
A seed may float on the breeze in any direction.
Yeah, I knew you would say that.
 But it's an energy converter.
 An energy converter of what?
I don't know.
Isn't that brilliant?  I love not knowing. Keeps me on my toes.
It must be awful being a prophet, waking up every morning, "Is it raining? Yes, I said so." Takes all the fun out of life. But who designed this, Lucius, hm?
 Who gave you these instructions?
 I think you've babbled enough.
Lucius, tell me, honestly, I'm on your side.
 I can help.
 You insult the gods.
There can be only one sentence. At arms!
Oh, morituri te salutant.
Celtic prayers won't help you now.
But, sir, he made me do it.
 Mr Dextrus, please, don't.
 Come on now, Quintus.
Dignity in death.
I respect your victory, Lucius.
Shake on it?
Come on.
Dying man's wish?
 But he's...
 Show me.
The work of the gods.
He's stone!
Armless enough, though. Whoops! Quintus!
 Run!
 The carvings!
Run!
My carvings!
The work is unbroken.
Oh, Lord of the Mountain, I beseech you!
This man...
would prevent the rise of Pompeii.
Lord, I beg of you, show yourself.
Show yourself!
No sign of them.
Nice little bit of allons-y. I think we're all right.
But his arm, Doctor.
Is that happening to Evelina?
What was that?
The mountain?
No, it's closer.
 Footsteps...
 It can't be.
 Footsteps underground.
 What is it?
What IS it?
What is it? What's that noise?
Doesn't sound like Vesuvius!
Caecilius, all of you! Get out!
 Doctor! What is it?
 I think we're being followed.
Just get out!
The gods are with us.
Water! We need water!
Quintus, all of you, get water! Donna!
Blest are we to see the gods.
Talk to me, that's all I want!
Talk to me, just tell me you are.
Don't hurt these people!
I'm the Doctor, just tell me who you are.
Doctor!
What was it?
Carapace of stone, held together by internal magma, not too difficult to stop. But I reckon that's just the foot soldier.
Doctor, or whatever your name is, you bring bad luck on this house.
I thought your son was brilliant, aren't you going to thank him?
Still...
If there ARE aliens at work in Pompeii, it's a good thing we stayed.
Donna!
Donna?
Donna?
You have got to be kidding me.
The False Prophet will surrender both her blood  and her breath.
 I'll surrender you in a minute.
Don't you dare!
 You will be silent.
 Listen, sister.
You might have eyes on the back of your hands, but they'll be in the back of your head when I've finished with you!
LET me GO!
This prattling voice will cease forever!
Oh, that'll be the day.
No man is allowed to enter the Temple of Sibyl.
Well, that's all right, just us girls.
Do you know, I met the Sibyl once, hell of a woman.
Blimey, she could dance the Tarantella! Nice teeth.
Truth be told, I think she had a bit of a thing for me.
I said it would never last, she said, "I know".
Well, she would.
 You OK there?
 Oh, never better.
 I like the toga.
 Thank you.
 And the ropes?
 Yeah, not so much.
What magic is this?
Let me tell you about the Sibyl, the founder of this religion.
She would be ashamed of you.
All her wisdom and insight gone sour.
Is that how you spread the word? On the blade of a knife?
Yes, a knife that now welcomes you.
Show me this man!
High Priestess, the stranger would defile us.
Let me see. This one is different.
He carries starlight in his wake.
Oh, very perceptive.
Where do these words of wisdom come from?
 The gods whisper to me.
 They've done far more than that.
Might I beg audience? Look upon the High Priestess?
Oh, my God.
 What's happened to YOU?
 The heavens have blessed me.
If I might...
 Does it hurt?
 It is necessary.
 Who told you that?
 The voices.
Is that what's gonna happen to Evelina?
Is this what's gonna happen to all of you?
The blessings are manifold.
 They're stone.
 Exactly.
The people of Pompeii are turning  to stone BEFORE the volcano erupts.
 But why?
 This word, this image in your mind.
This... volcano... What is that?
More to the point, why don't you know about it?
 Who are you?
 High Priestess of the Sibylline.
No, no, no, no, no, I'm talking to the creature inside you.
The thing seeding itself into a human body, in the dust, in the lungs, taking over the flesh and turning it into...
 What?
 Your knowledge...
is impossible.
Oh, but you can read my mind, you know it's not.
I demand you tell me who you are!
We... are... awakening.
The voice of the gods!
Words of wisdom, words of power. Words of wisdom, words of power...
Name yourself! Planet of origin.
Galactic coordinates.
Designation according to the  ratification of the Shadow Proclamation.
We...
... are... rising.
Tell... me... your name!
Pyrovile.
Pyrovile, Pyrovile, Pyrovile...
 What's a Pyrovile?
 That, growing inside HER.
 She's the halfway stage.
 And that turns into...
That thing in the villa was an adult Pyrovile.
And the breath of a Pyrovile  will incinerate YOU, Doctor.
I warn you, I'm armed!
Donna, get that grille open.
 What for?
 Just...
What are the Pyrovile doing here?
We fell from the heavens.
We fell so far and so fast, we were rendered into dust.
Right, creatures of stone, shattered on impact.
When was that, 17 years ago?
We have slept beneath for thousands of years.
OK, so 17 years ago woke you up, and now you're using human bodies to reconstitute yourselves,  but why the psychic powers?
 We opened their minds and found such gifts.
OK, so you force yourself inside a human brain, use the latent psychic talent to bond, I get that.
But seeing the future,  that is way beyond psychic, you can see through time.
Where does the gift of prophecy come from?
Got it!
 Now get down!
 What, down there?
Yes, down there.
Why can't they predict a volcano? Why is it being hidden?
Sisters, I see into his mind.
The weapon is harmless!
Yeah, but it's gotta sting.
Get down there!
You fought her off with a water pistol.
I bloody love you!
This way!
 Where are we going now?
 Into the volcano.
 No way.
 Yes way.
Appian way.
The stranger would threaten our great endeavour.
The time has come.
The prophecy must ADVANCE!
The prophecy must advance.
Thy will be done.
 Summon the Cult of Vulcan.
 Yes, sir.
We must go to the mountain.
Vesuvius awaits.
Sunrise, my love.
A new day.
Even the longest night must end.
The mountain's worse than ever.
We killed a messenger of the gods in our own house.
Sweetheart, can you see?
Tell us.
What's going to happen?
Just leave her alone.
 I can see...
 What is it?
A choice.
Someone must make a choice.
The most terrible choice.
But if it's aliens setting off the volcano, doesn't that make it all right, for you to stop it?
Still part of history.
But I'm history to you.
You saved me, in 2008,  you saved us all. Why's that different?
Some things are fixed, some things are in flux.
 Pompeii is fixed.
 How do you know which is which?
Because that's how I see the universe.
Every waking second, I can see what is, what was, what could be, what must not.
That's the burden of the Time Lord, Donna.
And I'm the only one left.
 How many people died?
 Stop it.
Doctor, how many people died?
20,000.
Is that what you can see, Doctor?
All 20,000?
And you think that's all right, do you?
They know we're here. Come on!
Almighty Vesuvius, accept these offerings, in Vulcan's design, and show unto us, I beseech you,  the gods of the Underworld.
It's the heart of Vesuvius.
We're right inside the mountain.
There's tons of them.
What's that thing?
Oh, hurry up and think of something, Rocky fall's on its way.
That's how they arrived.
Or what's left of it. Escape pod?
Prison ship?
Gene bank?
But why do they need a volcano?
Maybe...
it erupts, and they launch themselves  back into space or something.
Oh, it's worse than that.
How could it be worse?
Doctor, it's getting closer.
Heathens!
Defile us!
They would desecrate your temple,  My Lord gods!
Come on.
 We can't go in!
 Well, we can't go back.
Crush them!
Burn them!
There is nowhere to run, Doctor,  and daughter of London.
Now then, Lucius, My Lords Pyrovillian, don't get yourselves in a lava.
 In a lava?
 No?
No. No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods, before we perish, once this new race of creatures is complete, then what?
My masters will follow the  example of Rome itself.
An almighty empire,  bestriding the whole of civilisation.
But if you've crashed, and you've got all this technology, why don't you just go home?
The Heaven of Pyrovillia is gone.
What do you mean, "gone"? Where's it gone?
It was taken. Pyrovillia is lost.
But there is heat enough in this  world for a new species to rise.
Yeah, I should warn you,  it's 70% water out there.
Water can boil. And everything will burn, Doctor.
Then the whole planet is at stake.
Thank you. That's all I needed to know.
Donna!
You have them, My Lords!
Could we be any more trapped?
Little bit hot.
See? The energy converter takes the lava, uses the power to create a fusion matrix, which welds Pyrovile to human.
It's complete, they can convert millions.
Can't you change it? With these controls?
Course I can, but don't you see?
That's why the soothsayers can't see the volcano. There IS no volcano.
Vesuvius is never going to erupt.
The Pyrovile are stealing all its power, they'll use it to take over the world.
But... you can change it back?
I can invert the system,  set off the volcano, and blow them up, yes.
But that's the choice, Donna.
It's Pompeii or the world.
Oh, my God.
If Pompeii is destroyed then it's not just history.
It's me.
I make it happen.
But the Pyrovile are rocks,  maybe they can't be blown up.
Vesuvius explodes with the  force of 24 nuclear bombs.
Nothing can survive it.
Certainly not us.
Never mind us.
Push this lever and it's over.
20,000 people.
Nooooooo!
A new prophecy.
The future is changing.
The sky is FALLING!
Death. Only death!
It WAS an escape pod.
Out! Out, everybody out!
Quickly!
You lied to us!
And yet, this was meant to be.
Don't!
Don't go to the beach!
Don't go to the beach, go to the hills!
Listen to me!
Don't go to the beach, it's not SAFE!
Listen to me!
Come here.
Give him to me!
Come on.
Yeah! God save us, Doctor!
No!
Don't say you can't!
DOCTOR!
You can't just LEAVE them!
Don't you think I've done enough?
History's back in place. Everyone dies.
You've got to go back.
Doctor, I'm telling you, take this thing BACK!
It's not fair.
No, it's not.
But your own planet. It burned.
That's just it. Don't you see, Donna?
Can't you understand? If I could  go back and save them then I would, but I can't.
I can never go back, I can't.
I just can't, I can't.
Just someone.
Please.
Not the whole town.
Just save someone.
Come with me.
It's never forgotten, Caecilius.
Oh, time will pass, men will move on,  and stories will fade.
But one day, Pompeii will be found, again.
In thousands of years.
And everyone will remember you.
What about you, Evelina?
Can you see anything?
The visions have gone.
The explosion was so powerful it cracked open a rift in time.
Just for a second. That's what gave you the gift of prophecy.
It echoed back into the  Pyrovillian alternative.
But not any more.
You're free.
But tell me, who are you, Doctor?
With your words, and your temple  containing such size within?
Oh, I was never here.
Don't tell anyone.
The great god Vulcan must be enraged!
It's so volcanic.
It's like some sort of...
volcano.
All those people.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You were right.
Sometimes I need someone.
Welcome aboard.
Yeah.
Metella, my love, have you seen that clasp?
The beetle one.
 The Egyptians do love a scarab.
 Here we are, I was giving it a polish.
Now calm down.
If I get that contract,  for the marble granaries of Alexandria, we'll be rich, you'll see...
Hold on there, Evelina.
You are not going out wearing that!
Don't start, Dad, it's what all the girls in Rome are wearing.
I'll see you later.
Are you seeing that boy again?
Oh, look at Quintus.
My son, the doctor.
Mum, I've told you, I'm not a doctor, not yet.
I'm just a student of the physical sciences.
Well, that's a doctor to me.
Give thanks to the household gods before you go.
There's a good boy.
Come here, let me fix it. You've got that folded all wrong...
Thank you, household gods.
Thank you for everything.
Now then, Doctor Noble,  Mrs Noble, come with me.

Idiot. Bleeding us dry.
You there, get me last month's military export figures.
The army always need more grunts.
Yes, sir.
RECEPTIONIST ON INTERCOM: Mr Bartle, you asked me to call you.
Solana, when those buyers arrive, we're going to pitch like never before.
I want those Ood flying out of here.
That... I said military figures. That's the domestic file.
Get me the military.
The file is irrelevant, sir.
Oh? And why's that?
Have a nice day.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) (DONNA SCREAMING) Set the controls for random. Mystery tour.
Outside that door could be any planet, anywhere, anywhen in the whole wide...
Are you all right? Terrified.
I mean, history's one thing, but an alien planet!
I could always take you home.
Yeah, don't laugh at me.
I know what it's like, everything you're feeling right now.
Fear, the joy, the wonder, I get that!
Seriously? After all this time?
Yeah! Why do you think I keep going?
Oh! All right, then, you and me both.
This is barmy!
I was born in Chiswick.
I've only ever done package holidays and now I'm here, This is... It's not... I mean, it's...
I don't know, it's all sort of... I don't even know what the word is!
I've got the word.
Freezing.
Snow!
Ah, real snow. Proper snow at last.
That's more like it. Lovely. What do you think?
Bit cold.
Look at that view.
DONNA: Yup, beautiful, cold view.
Millions of planets, millions of galaxies, and we're on this one.
“Molto bene, bellissimo, "says Donna.
Born in Chiswick.
Oh, you've had a life of work and sleep, telly and rent and tax, and takeaway dinners, all birthdays and Christmases, and two weeks’ holiday a year, and then you end up here.
Donna Noble, citizen of the Earth, standing on a different planet.
How about that, Donna?
Donna?
Sorry, you were saying?
Better?
Lovely, thanks.
~Comfy?
Yup.
Can you hear anything inside that?
Pardon?
Right, I was saying, citizen of the Earth...

Blimey, a real proper rocket!
Now, that's what I call a spaceship.
You've got a box. He's got a Ferrari.
Come on, let's see where he's going.
Mr Halpen, sir, Dr Ryder, new head of Ood Management.
How many dead? Come on, facts and figures.
I haven't flown all this way to discuss the weather, which by the way, is freezing.
Solana has the figures, sir.
Solana Mercurio, sir, head of marketing and galactic liaison.
That's just what I need, a PR woman.
I don't want a word of this getting out. Is that understood?
Now, get to the point. How many dead?
In the past financial quarter, we've had three deaths in the complex, all attributed to heart attacks or industrial accidents.
But now we've captured this on tape, the cause would seem the same.
He's using the translator ball as a weapon. How does that work?
I have no idea. I'm checking the equipment. Nothing so far.
Can't see its eyes from this angle.
I think we have to assume...
Red eye.
I would think so, sir.
That Ood, what happened to it?
It ran for the wild, sir, like a dog.
One of the guards fired off a shot. It'll be dead by now.
Can I ask, what's red eye, sir?
It's some sort of infection. The Ood eyes literally change colour.
Drink.
I can't find the source, All the bacterial scans register negative.
I'm sorry, but according to your own rules, sir, there's no alcohol allowed on base.
It's hair tonic if you must know.

(BOTH LAUGHING) (MELODIC SINGING) Hold on. Can you hear that?
Donna, take your hood down.
What?
That noise, it's like a song.
Over there!
What is it?
An Ood. He's called an Ood.
But its face...
Donna, don't, not now. It's a he, not an it. Give me a hand.
Sorry.
I don't know where the heart is. I don't know if he’s got a heart.
Talk to him. Keep him going.
It's all right. We've got you.
Um, what's your name?
Designated Ood Delta 50.
My name's Donna.
No, no, no, no. You don't need to.
Sorry.
Oh, God.
This is the Doctor. Just what you need, a doctor.
Couldn't be better, eh?
You've been shot.
The circle...
No, don't try to talk.
The circle must be broken.
Circle? What do you mean?
Delta 50, what circle? Delta 50, what circle?
(ROARING) (GROANING) He's gone.
Careful.
There you are, sweetheart.
We were too late. What do we do? Do we bury him?
The snow'll take care of that.
Who was he? What's an Ood?
They're servants of humans in the 42nd century.
Mildly telepathic. That was their song. It was his mind calling out.
Couldn't hear anything.
DONNA: He sang as he was dying. DOCTOR: His eyes turned red.
What's that mean?
Trouble. Come on.
DOCTOR: The Ood are harmless. They're completely benign.
Except the last time I met them, there was this force, like a stronger mind, powerful enough to take them over.
What sort of force?
Ah, long story.
Long walk.
It was the devil.
If you're gonna take the mickey, I'll just put my hood back up.
Must be something different this time, though, something closer to home.
Aha!
Civilisation!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ood Sphere.
And isn't it bracing?
Here are your information packs, with vouchers, 3D tickets and a map of the complex.
My name's Solana, head of marketing.
I'm sure we've all spoken on the vid-phone.
If you'd like to follow me...
Sorry! Late. Don't mind us. Hello. The guards let us through.
And you would be?
The Doctor and Donna Noble.
Representing the Noble Corporation, PLC Limited, Intergalactic.
Must have fallen off my list. My apologies. Won't happen again.
Now then, Dr Noble, Mrs Noble, if you'd like to come with me?
Oh, no, no, no, we're not married.
We're so not married.
No.
Never, ever.
Of course. And here are your information packs, vouchers inside.
Now, if you'd like to come with me, the executive suites are nice and warm.
(ALARM BLARING) Oh, what's that? That sounds like an alarm.
For God's sake, we've got the buyers arriving.
Who sounded the alarm? Drink.
Oh, it's just a siren for the end of the work shift.
Now then, this way, quick as you can.
Mr Kess, what the hell is going on?
Ood on the loose, sir.
Looks like we got another one.
Red eye?
As red as sin, sir. Don't worry, Mr Halpen. We're on it.
Sir! All right, guys Go! Get him!
As you can see, the Ood are happy to serve, and we keep them in facilities of the highest standard.
Here at the Double-0, that's Ood Operations, we like to think of the Ood as our trusted friends, You two, go left! You two, follow me!
We keep the Ood healthy, safe and educated.
Come on!
Take him alive!
We don't just breed the Ood, we make them better.
Because at heart, what is an Ood but a reflection of us?
If your Ood is happy...
(ROARING) . then you'll be happy, too.
Mr Halpen, this is a bit more than red eye, sir.
This is something new. It’s rabid, sir.
(ROARING) Take it to Dr Ryder. Just get it out of sight.
MAN ON INTERCOM: Sales speakers needed by 1900, sir.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What do you think? Growing back? Just a little bit?
Like you'd know.
I'd now like to point out a new innovation from Ood Operations.
We've introduced a variety package with the Ood translator ball.
You can now have the standard setting.
How are you today, Ood?
I'm perfectly well, thank you.
Or perhaps after a stressful day, a little something for the gentlemen.
And how are you, Ood?
IN FEMALE VOICE: All the better for seeing you.
And the comedy classic option. Ood, you dropped something.
D'oh!
All that for only five additional credits.
The details are in your brochures.
Now, there's plenty more food and drink, so don't hold back.
Ah, got it.
The Ood Sphere. I've been to this solar system before, years ago.
Ages. Close to the planet Sense Sphere.
Let's widen it out.
The year 4126.
That is the Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire.
4126?
It's 4126? I'm in 4126.
It's good, isn’t it?
What's the Earth like now?
A bit full, but the empire stretches out across three galaxies.
It's weird. I mean, it's brilliant, but back home, the papers and telly, they keep saying we haven't got long to live.
Global warming, flooding, all the bees disappearing.
Yeah, that thing about the bees is odd.
But look at us. We're everywhere. Is that good or bad, though?
Are we like explorers, or more like a virus?
Sometimes I wonder.
What are the red dots?
Ood distribution centres.
Across three galaxies? Don't the Ood get a say in this?
Um, sorry, but...
Hello.
Tell me, are you all like this?
I do not understand, miss.
Why'd you say "miss"? Do I look single?
Back to the point.
Yeah. What I mean is, are there any free Ood?
Are there Ood running wild somewhere, like wildebeest?
All Ood are born to serve. Otherwise we would die.
You can't have started like that.
Before the humans, what were you like?
The circle.
What do you mean? What circle?
The... The circle is...
Ladies and gentlemen, all Ood to hospitality stations, please.
I've had enough of this schmoozing.
Do you fancy getting off the beaten track?
SOLANA: If I can introduce you...
"Rough Guide to the Ood Sphere"? Works for me.
Yeah.
(ROARING) What the hell is wrong with it?
It's obviously stage two of red eye, whatever that means.
Ood Sigma, have you seen this before?
Humanity defines us, sir. We look to you for answers, Oh, fat lot of good, all of you.
We're exporting hundreds of thousands of Ood to all the civilised planets.
If they turn rabid, you know what it'll mean.
There's only one thing I haven't checked, sir. Warehouse 15.
Why should that cause trouble? It's been two centuries now.
No change. Not ever. Drink.
I know it's restricted access, but if I'm going to work on this, I should see it, just in case.
Can't stand the place.
Let's go. Warehouse 15, then. Come on.
What about this one, sir?
I would suggest a postmortem, which means it's gotta be dead first.
(GUNS COCKING) (GUNS FIRING) Get up.
I said, get up.
Servants?
They're slaves.
Get up!
March.
Last time I met the Ood, I never thought, never asked.
That's not like you.
I was busy.
So busy I couldn't save them. Thad to let the Ood die.
I reckon I owe them one.
That looks like the boss, Let's keep out of his way. Come on.
How long since you went inside?
Must be 10 years ago.
COMPUTER VOICE: Warehouse 15.
My father brought me here when I was six years old.
Security protocol initiated.
God, the stench of it.
Warehouse 15 door open.
Incredible.
Like I said, nothing's changed.
I've read the documents, but it doesn't quite prepare you.
Is it just me or does it feel as if it's looking at you?
I think I understand the barrier mechanics well enough.
Check the signal.
I suppose it's home, sweet home to you.
What do you think?
I have no opinion, sir.
Well, say hello to Daddy.
Nothing. The barrier's intact. No abnormal signal.
Same as it’s been for 200 years.
SOLANA: Mr Halpen, the two people from the Noble Corporation failed to pass security checks.
There's no such company. The Noble Corporation doesn't exist.
And on top of that, they seem to have gone missing, sir, the Doctor and Miss Noble.
Just what I need.
Start a search. No alarms, got that? Keep it quiet.
You see? Hair loss. Drink.
Tell you what, old friend.
Have this one on me.
Cheers, (ROARING) I think we're finished here.
Sorry.
Where'd you learn to whistle?
West Ham, every Saturday.
DOCTOR: Ood export.
You see?
Lifts up the containers, takes them to the rocket ships, ready to be flown out all over the three galaxies.
What, you mean these containers are full of...
What do you think?
Oh, it stinks.
How many of them do you think there are in each one?
A hundred. More, A great, big empire built on slavery.
It's not so different from your time.
Oi, I haven't got slaves.
Who do you think made your clothes?
Is that why you travel around with a human at your side?
It's not so you can show them the wonders of the universe.
It's so you can take cheap shots. Sorry.
Don't.
Spaceman.
I don't understand, the door was open, why don't you just run away?
For what reason?
You could be free, I do not understand the concept.
What is it with that Persil ball?
I mean, they're not born with it, are they?
Why do they have to be all plugged in?
Ood, tell me, does the circle mean anything to you?
ALL: The circle must be broken.
Oh, that is creepy.
What is it? What is the circle?
ALL: The circle must be broken.
Why?
So that we can sing.
Mr Halpen, I'm in Ood Cargo.
I've found your unwanted guests.
Go!
(ALARM BLARING) That's us. Come on.
Cut the alarms! I said, no alarms!
Nothing to worry about, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a fire drill. We test the system at this time every day.
If you'll excuse me...
Doctor! There's a door!
GUARD: Don't move!
Where've you gone?
GUARD: Stay where you are!
Help me!
Keep her here for now.
Help me! Get off me!
Donna, where are you?
All guards withdraw. “Sit?
I said, withdraw. Keep to the perimeter.
I've got this one.
I've always wanted to do this.
(GRUNTING) Container locked.
Ahhh!
Can you help me?
Oh, no, you don't.
What have I done? I'm not one of that lot.
I'm on your side.
Stay where you are. That's an order.
I said, stay.
Doctor! Doctor!
(BREATHING HEAVILY) You heard the instructions. Mr Halpen wants them alive.
Doctor, get me out!
Doctor, get me out of here!
If you don't do what she says, you're really in trouble.
Not from me, from her.
Unlock the container.
Doctor.
There we go. Safe and sound.
Never mind about me, What about them?
To the left! Fire!
Shoot to kill!
If people back on Earth knew what was going on here...
Don't be so stupid. Of course they know.
They know how you treat the Ood?
They don't ask. Same thing.
Solana, the Ood aren't born like this. They can't be.
A species born to serve could never evolve in the first place.
What does the company do to make them obey?
It's nothing to do with me.
Oh, what, ‘cause you don't ask?
That's Dr Ryder's territory.
Where is he? What part of the complex?
I could help with the red eye. Now, show me!
There, beyond the red section.
Come with me.
You've seen the warehouse. You can't agree with all this.
You know this place better than me. You could help.
They're over here! Guards! They're over here!
Male and female suspects escaped. West ridge corridor.
Mr Halpen, I found the Doctor. He's heading for Ood Conversion.
On my way.
Mr Kess, what's the situation?
We've contained it, sir. Fenced them in.
But the red eye seems to be permanent this time. It's not fading.
Worse than that, sir, there's more of them going rabid.
In my opinion, sir, I think we've lost them.
The entire batch contaminated.
What's causing it? Why now?
What's changed?
How many Ood in total? I'd say about 2,000, sir.
We can write them off. That's what insurance is for.
i We've plenty more on the breeding farms. Let's start again.
Fetch the canisters. No survivors.
My pleasure, sir.
You lot, canisters.
This way!
Oh, can you hear it?
I didn't need the map. I should have listened.
Does that mean we're locked in?
Listen.
Listen, listen, listen, listen.
(MELODIC SINGING) Oh, my head.
What is it?
Can't you hear it? The singing.
DONNA: They look different to the others.
That's because they're natural-born Ood, unprocessed, before they're adapted to slavery, unspoiled.
That's their song.
I can't hear it.
Do you want to?
Yeah.
It's the song of captivity.
Let me hear it.
Face me.
Open your mind, that's it. Hear it, Donna.
(MELODIC SINGING) Hear the music.
Take it away.
You sure?
I can't bear it.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
But you can still hear it?
All the time.
Come on, what's the hold-up?
It's the experimentation lab. Maximum security. He's fused the system.
Well, don’t just stand there! Get the bolt cutters. Rip that door off!
Solana, go back to the reps.
I don't want any of them wandering off and seeing this.
And get them away from the Ood, just in case.
Hurry up!
Yes, sir.
(METAL CLANGING) They're breaking in.
Ah, let them.
What are you holding? Show me.
Friend.
Doctor, Donna. Friend.
Let me see.
Look at me.
Let me see, That's it.
That's good. Go on.
Is that...
It's a brain. A hindbrain. The Ood are born with a secondary brain.
Like the amygdala in humans, it processes memory and emotions.
You get rid of that, you wouldn't be Donna any more.
You'd be like an Ood, a processed Ood.
So the company cuts off their brains.
And they stitch on the translator.
Like a lobotomy.
I spent all that time looking for you, Doctor.
I guess I thought it was so wonderful out here.
I want to go home.
(DOOR OPENING) They're with the Ood, sir.
What are you gonna do, then? Arrest me?
Lock me up? Throw me in a cage?
Well, you're too late. Ha!
Why don’t you just come out and say it? Photo activists.
If that's what Friends of the Ood are trying to prove, then yes.
The Ood were nothing without us, just animals roaming around on the ice.
That's because you can't hear them.
They welcomed it. It's not as if they put up a fight.
You idiot.
They're born with their brains in their hands, Don't you see? That makes them peaceful.
They've got to be because a creature like that would have to trust anyone it meets.
Oh, nice one.
Thank you.
The system's worked for 200 years. All we've got is a rogue batch.
But the infection is about to be sterilised.
Mr Kess, how do we stand?
Canisters primed, sir.
As soon as the core heats up, the gas is released.
Give it 200 marks and counting.
You're gonna gas them? ~Kill the livestock.
The classic foot-and-mouth solution from the olden days.
Still works, (OOD SINGING) I'm sorry, if I could ask you one more time, could all the reps please come through to the education suites?
Why move now? It's a free bar!
Could I ask all the Ood to withdraw? It's feeding time.
Oh, you've upset them! Leave them alone.
I have to insist, if all the Ood could please leave...
Ladies and gentlemen, change of plan. If you could leave by the fire exits.
I could sell this. You could offer different colours.
(TRANSLATOR BALLS BUZZING) They've gone insane, miss. They've gone mad, all of them.
Just shoot them! Shoot to kill!
(ALARM BLARING) What the hell?
What's going on out there?
MAN: We have now Emergency status. Emergency status.
All exits sealed. Emergency clearance authorised.
Ood distribution centre now completely...
It's a revolution.
Come back! Let me out of here!
No!
(SCREAMING) Change of plan.
No reports of trouble off-world, sir. It's still contained to the Ood Sphere.
Then we've got a public duty to stop it before it spreads.
What's happening?
Everything you wanted, Doctor.
No doubt there'll be a full police investigation once this place has been sterilised, so I can't risk a bullet to the head.
I'll leave you to the mercies of the Ood.
Mr Halpen, there's something else, isn't there? Something we haven't seen.
What do you mean?
A creature couldn't survive with a separate forebrain and hindbrain.
They'd be at war with themselves.
There's got to be something else. A third element, right?
And again, so clever.
It's got to be connected to the red eye. What is it?
It won't exist for very much longer.
Enjoy your Ood.
Come on.
(MACHINE GUNS FIRING) Dr Ryder, Warehouse 15.
But what about this one?
No. You've not turned. Faithful to the last.
Go, join your people while you still can.
Come on.
Well, do something. You're the one with all the tricks.
You must have met Houdini.
These are really good handcuffs.
Well, I'm glad of that. I mean, at least we've got quality.
(DOOR OPENING) Uh, Doctor, Donna. Friends.
The circle must be broken.
Doctor, Donna. Friends!
The circle must be broken!
Doctor, Donna. Friends! Friends!
The circle must be broken.
The circle must be broken!
Doctor, Donna. Friends! Doctor...
DONNA: (ECHOING) The circle must be broken!
Doctor, Donna. Friends. Friends!
The circle must be broken.
Doctor, Donna. Friends!
The circle...
DONNA: (ECHOING) The circle must be broken!
Doctor, Donna. Friends!
The circle must be broken!
The circle must...
(OOD SINGING) Doctor, Donna. Friends.
Yes! That's us! Friends! Oh, yes! That's him. That's me!
(GUARD SCREAMING) No, leave him! Leave him.
Behind you! Behind you!
I don't know where it is.
GUARD: Fall back!
I don't know where they've gone.
What are we looking for?
It might be underground, like some sort of cave or a cavern or...
(MACHINE GUN FIRE CONTINUES) Warehouse 15, door open.
All right?
It's always been an option. My grandfather drew up this plan.
That's the advantage of a family-run business, Dr Ryder.
The personal touch.
But we should evacuate. If we can get to the rocket shed...
No need. We've got this.
Detonation packs.
Place them around the circumference.
We're going to blow it up.
If this thing dies, so do the Ood.
(MELODIC SINGING) The Ood brain.
DOCTOR: Now it all makes sense. That's the missing link.
The third element binding them together.
Forebrain, hindbrain and this.
The telepathic centre. It's a shared mind.
Connecting all the Ood in song.
(CHAINS RATTLING) Cargo. I could always go in to cargo.
I've got the rockets, I've got the sheds.
Smaller business. Much more manageable. Without livestock, He's mined the area.
They're gonna kill it.
They found that thing centuries ago beneath the northern glacier.
Those pylons. Ina circle.
DONNA: The circle must be broken.
Dampening the telepathic field.
Stopping the Ood from connecting for 200 years.
And you, Ood Sigma, you brought them here.
I expected better.
My place is at your side, sir.
Still subservient. Good Ood.
If that barrier thing's in place, how come the Ood started breaking out?
Maybe it's taken centuries to adapt, subconscious reaching out.
But the process was too slow, had to be accelerated.
You should never have given me access to the controls, Mr Halpen.
I lowered the barrier to its minimum.
Friends of the Ood, sir.
It's taken me 10 years to infiltrate the company.
And I succeeded, Yes.
Yes, you did.
You murdered him.
Very observant, Ginger.
Now then...
Can't say I've ever shot anyone before.
Can't say I'm gonna like it.
But it's not exactly a normal day, is it?
Still.
Would you like a drink, sir?
I think hair loss is the least of my problems right now, thanks.
Please have a drink, sir.
 If you're gonna stand in their way, I'll shoot you, too.
Please have a drink, sir.
Have... Have you poisoned me?
Natural Ood must never kill, sir.
What is that stuff?
Ood graft suspended in a biological compound, sir.
What the hell does that mean?
Oh, dear!
Tell me!
Funny thing, the subconscious. Takes all sorts of shapes.
Came out in the red eyes’ revenge, came out in the rabid Oods' anger, and then there was patience.
All that intelligence and mercy focused on Ood Sigma.
How's the hair loss, Mr Halpen?
What have you done?
Oh, they've been preparing you for a very long time.
And now you're standing next to the Ood brain.
Mr Halpen, can you hear it?
Listen.
(MELODIC SINGING) What have you...
I'm not...
They...
They turned him into an Ood?
Yup.
He's an Ood!
I noticed.
(MOANING) He has become Ood-kind, and we will take care of him.
It's weird. Being with you, I can't tell what's right and what's wrong any more.
It's better that way.
People who know for certain tend to be like Mr Halpen.
Oh!
(BEEPING) That's better.
And now, Sigma, would you allow me the honour?
It is yours, Doctor.
Oh, yes!
Stifled for 200 years, but not any more.
The circle is broken.
The Ood can sing!
(MELODIC SINGING) I can hear it!
DOCTOR: The message has gone out.
That song resonated across the galaxies. Everyone heard it.
Everyone knows.
The rockets are bringing them back.
The Ood are coming home.
We thank you, Doctor, Donna, friends of Ood-kind.
And what of you now? Will you stay?
There is room in the song for you.
Oh, I... I've sort of got a song of my own, thanks.
I think your song must end soon.
Meaning?
Every song must end.
Yeah.
Um, what about you? You still want to go home?
No. Definitely not.
Then we'll be off.
Take this song with you.
We will, Always.
And know this, Doctor, Donna, you will never be forgotten.
Our children will sing of the Doctor, Donna, and our children's children, and the wind and the ice and the snow will carry your names forever.
Doctor? It's Martha.
And I'm bringing you back to Earth.
Yesterday, 52 people died in identical circumstances, right across the world, in 11 different time zones.
And you think ATMOS is alien?
It's our job to investigate that possibility.
Who are you?
I am General Staal of the 10th Sontaran Battle Fleet.
We have an intruder!
MARTHA: Operation Blue Sky is go, go, go.
Is that what you did to her? Turned her into a soldier?
MARTHA: Is that...
Sontaran!
Stare into the face of death!  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
WOMAN: No! Just back off!
(GRUNTS) MAN 1: Come on!
You're going to regret this. Completely ridiculous!
Get your hand off me.
(GRUNTS) I think that makes my answer clear. Don't you?
Oh, and, uh...
If you're going to go to print, spell my name right.
Rattigan, with two Ts.
Oh, this goes way beyond the newspapers. This thing's worldwide.
I'm telling you, Atmos is dangerous.
But if you had proof, then you wouldn't be here.
Fine, If you won't listen, I'll find someone else who will.
ATMOS: Welcome. What is your destination?
You're the last thing I need.
Atmos cannot be disabled.
(GRUNTS) Right then.
Take me to UNIT headquarters, Tower Bridge, London.
UNIT headquarters.
Her name's Jo Nakashima, a freelance journalist.
Clever by the sound of it, not as clever as me, but that goes without saying.
I'd recommend termination.
ATMOS: Remember your status, boy. We do not take orders from humans.
I said, "Recommend".
Then your advice shows military wisdom. She will be terminated.
Cool.
RECORDED VOICE: This is UNIT, extension 221...
Don't put me through to answerphone.
(BEEP) Yes, this is a message for Colonel Mace from Jo, Jo Nakashima.
Look, you should've got my e-mail.
I've been investigating a number of deaths related to Atmos systems.
SATNAV: Go straight on.
Now I can't prove anything, but there's got to be a link.
I need you to check out all the people who died in Atmos cars yesterday.
And then, check out the time.
Turn right.
I don't believe this.
This is your final destination.
I said, take me to UNIT.
(BEEPS) Go straight on.
I don't think so. I'll find my own way, thanks.
(ENGINE REVVING) This is your final destination.
This is your final destination.
No!
This is your final destination.
No! Help!
This is your final destination.
No, no, no! No!
(TARDIS WHOOSHING) I can't believe I'm doing this.
No, Neither can I.
Whoa, whoa, careful.
Left hand down. Left hand down.
Getting a bit too close to the 1980s.
What am I going to do? Put a dent in them?
Someone did.
(MOBILE RINGING) Hold on.
That's a phone.
You've got a mobile? Since when?
It's not mine.
Hello.
Doctor, it's Martha.
And I'm bringing you back to Earth.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) (WHOOSHING) Martha Jones.
Doctor.
You haven't changed a bit.
Neither have you.
How's the family?
You know, not so bad. Recovering.
What about you?
Right. I should've known.
Didn't take you long to replace me then.
Now, don't start fighting.
Martha, Donna. Donna, Martha.
Please don't fight. I can't bear fighting.
(CHUCKLING) You wish, I've heard all about you. He talks about you all the time.
I dread to think.
No, no, no.
No. He says nice things, good things. Nice things. Really good things.
Oh, my God! He's told you everything.
Didn't take you long to get over it, though.
Who's the lucky man?
What man? The lucky what?
She's engaged, you prawn.
Really? Who to?
Tom. That Tom Milligan.
He's in paediatrics.
Working out in Africa right now, and yes, I know, I've got a doctor who disappears off to distant places. Tell me about it.
Is he skinny?
No. He's sort of strong.
He is too skinny for words. You give him a hug, you get a paper cut.
Oh, I thought you were fighting.
No. Speaking of which...
WOMAN ON WALKIE-TALKIE: Dr Jones, report to base, please. Over.
This is Dr Jones. Operation Blue Sky is go, go, go.
I repeat, this is a go.
SOLDIER: Unified Intelligence Task Force, Raise that barrier now.
Leave your safeties on, lads. It's non-hostiles.
OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Al! workers, lay down your tools and surrender.
MARTHA: Greyhound 16 to Trap One, B Section. Go, go, go!
Search the ground floor. Grid pattern Delta.
What are you searching for?
Illegal aliens.
SOLDIER: This is a UNIT operation.
All workers lay down your tools and surrender immediately.
B Section mobilised.
E Section, F Section, on my command.
Is that what you did to her? Turned her into a soldier?
SKORR: As predicted, the UNIT forces have moved to the penultimate stage.
STAAL: Observe their troops.
Thin fabrics, exposed skin, feeble weapons.
These are toy soldiers, the playthings of children.
A Section, in position.
We are on standby, sir.
You're qualified now? You're a proper doctor?
UNIT rushed it through, given my experience in the field.
Here we go. We're establishing a field base on site, They're dying to meet you.
Wish I could say the same.
Operation Blue Sky complete, sir. Thanks for letting me take the lead.
And this is the Doctor.
Doctor, Colonel Mace. “Sir.
Oh, don't salute.
But it's an honour, sir.
I've read all the files on you.
Technically speaking, you're still on staff.
You never resigned.
What? You used to work for them?
Yeah, a long time ago.
Back in the '70s.
Or was it the ‘80s? But it was all a bit more homespun back then.
Times have changed, sir.
Yeah, that's enough of the “sir”.
Come on now, Doctor. You've seen it. You've been on board the Vatiant.
We've got massive funding from the United Nations, all in the name of Homeworld Security.
A modern UNIT for the modern world.
What, and that means arresting ordinary factory workers, in the streets in broad daylight?
It's more like Guantanamo Bay out there.
Donna. By the way, Donna Noble, since you didn't ask.
I'll have a salute, Ma'am.
Thank you.
So tell me, what's going on in that factory?
Yesterday, 52 people died in identical circumstances, right across the world, in 11 different time zones.
(BEEPING) 5:00 in the UK, 06:00 in France, 8:00 in Moscow, 13:00 in China...
You mean they died simultaneously?
Exactly.
52 deaths at the exact same moment worldwide, How did they die?
They were all inside their cars.
They were poisoned. I checked the biopsies, no toxins.
Whatever it is left the system immediately.
What have the cars got in common?
Completely different makes.
They're all fitted with Atmos. And that is the Atmos factory.
What is Atmos?
Well, come on, even I know that.
Everyone's got Atmos.
It stands for Atmospheric Omission System.
The Atmos in your car reduces CO2 emissions to zero.
Zero? No carbon, none at all?
And you get Sat Nav thrown in, plus 20 quid in shopping vouchers if you introduce a friend. Bargain.
And this is where they make it, Doctor. Shipping worldwide.
17 factories across the globe, but this is the central depot, sending Atmos to every country on Earth.
And you think Atmos is alien?
It's our job to investigate that possibility. Doctor?
And here it is, laid bare.
Atmos can be threaded through any and every make of car.
You must have checked it before it went on sale.
We did. We found nothing.
That's why I thought we needed an expert.
Really? Who'd you get?
Oh, right! Me, yes. Good.
Okay, so why would aliens be so keen on cleaning up our atmosphere?
A very good question.
Maybe they want to help, get rid of pollution and stuff.
Do you know how many cars there are on planet Earth?
800 million. Imagine that.
If you could control them, you'd have 800 million weapons.
We should head back. There's not much down there.
There should be just oil rooms, generators.
Aye, aye. What's this then?
You two, all personnel have been ordered to evacuate, Building's under UNIT control.
This area is out of bounds.
Excuse me, sunshine?
I think you'll find we're in charge.
We can do this the easy way...
(SNIFFING) . or the hard way.
SKORR: General Staal, they're close. ~STAAL: Excellent.
And like a good warrior, I shall enter the fray myself.
Let them pass.
It's open.
Come on.
What the hell?
Greyhound 16 to Trap One. We've found something.
Basement corridor, northside, grid 36. Request backup, over.
It's like something boiling inside.
Well, don't touch it.
Come on, Steve.
We get first rights on this.
That means promotion.
Just leave it alone.
Wait for backup.
(THUDDING) What was that?
It came from inside.
It could just be the machinery.
(THUDDING) (COCKS GUN) (THUDDING) Is there someone in there? Hello?
(KNOCKING) We've got to get this open.
We should wait for the others.
You could suffocate in there.
Greyhound 16 to Trap One.
Request immediate assistance. Repeat, immediate assistance. Over.
How do you work this thing? Come on.
(ALARM BUZZING) (COUGHING) Oh, God! It stinks.
What the hell is that stuff?
Identify yourself. Identify.
Greyhound 16 declaring absolute emergency, sir.
Repeat, absolute emergency. Over.
Can you hear me? Can you understand me?
Look at his neck. It's looks like an umbilical cord.
Well, don't get too close.
I think it's harmless, I don't think it’s properly alive.
It's going to drown. “No.
I think it breathes this stuff.
It's some kind of embryo.
What do you mean, “an embryo"?
Someone's growing a body. A human body.
Excellent skills of deduction.
I would rate you above average, soldier. Well done.
Whereas you, you smell of sweat and fear.
Yeah?
We're not the ones who got out of school early, sonny.
And stop playing Humpty Dumpty and tell us who you are.
Is that a reference to my height?
Short answer. Yes.
A pity.
Words are the weapons of womenfolk. I must judge you unfit.
What are you going to do? Bite our ankles?
(SCREAMS) I'm warning you.
A proper soldier gives no warning.
Fire. I order you. Fire.
The room is contained within a Cordolaine signal exciting the copper surface of the bullet and causing expansion within the barrel, rendering your guns useless.
And your radio signals have been blocked.
My legs. I can't feel my legs.
I apologise for disabling you.
Death has more honour, but you are needed for the stratagem.
Prepare them for processing.
You spoke of promotion, now you will serve a greater cause.
Who are you?
Indeed. Know your enemy.
I am General Staal of the 10th Sontaran Battle Fleet, known as Staal the Undefeated.
Oh, my God! Help us.
Ionising nano-membrane carbon dioxide converter, which means that Atmos works, filters the CO2 at a molecular level.
We know all that. But what's its origin? Is it alien?
No, but it's decades ahead of its time.
Look, do you mind? Could you stand back a bit?
~Sorry. Have I done something wrong?
You're carrying a gun.
I don't like people with guns hanging around me, all right?
If you insist.
Tetchy.
Well, it's true.
He's a good man.
People with guns are usually the enemy in my books. You seem quite at home.
If anyone got me used to fighting, it's you.
Oh, right. So it's my fault.
Well, you got me the job. Besides, look at me.
Am I carrying a gun?
I suppose not.
It's all right for you.
You can just come and go, but some of us have got to stay behind.
So I've got to work from the inside.
And by staying inside, maybe I stand a chance of making them better.
Yeah.
That's more like Martha Jones.
I learnt from the best.
Well...
Oi, you lot.
All your storm troopers and your sonics, rubbish.
You should've come with me.
Oh, where have you been?
Personnel. That's where the weird stuff's happening.
In the paperwork. ‘Cause I spent years working as a temp, I can find my way around an office blindfold.
And the first thing I noticed is an empty file.
Why, what's inside it? Or what's not inside it?
Sick days.
There aren't any. Hundreds of people working here and no one's sick.
Not one hangover, man ‘flu, sneaky little shopping trip.
Nothing. Not ever. They don't get ill.
That can't be right.
You've been checking out the building, you should've been checking out the workforce, I can see why he likes you.
You are good.
Super temp.
Dr Jones, set up a medical post. Start examining the workers.
I'll get them sent through.
Come on, Donna. Give me a hand.
So this Atmos thing, where did it come from?
Luke Rattigan himself. That himself would be?
A child genius.
Invented the Fountain Six search engine when he was 12 years old.
Millionaire overnight. Now runs the Rattigan Academy, a private school educating students hand-picked from all over the world.
A hothouse for geniuses. I won't mind going there.
I get lonely.
Do you think I should warn my mum? About the Atmos in her car.
Better safe than sorry. I'll give her a call.
Donna, do they know where you are? Your family?
I mean, that you're travelling with the Doctor?
Not really. Although my grandad sort of waved us off.
But I didn’t have time to explain.
You just left him behind?
Yeah.
I didn’t tell my family.
I kept it all so secret. It almost destroyed them.
In what way?
They ended up imprisoned. They were tortured.
My mum, my dad, my sister.
It wasn't the Doctor's fault, but you need to be careful.
‘Cause you know the Doctor. He's wonderful, he's brilliant, but he's like fire, Stand too close and people get burnt.
Conditioning is complete.
Now do your duty and advance the conquest.
BOTH: Yes, sir.
General Staal returning. The stratagem advances.
The last days of planet Earth.
(OSCILLATING DRONE) You're not coming with me.
I want to talk to this Luke Rattigan, not point a gun at him.
It's 10 miles outside London. How are you going to get there?
Well, then, get me a jeep.
According to the records, you travel by Tardis.
If there is a danger of hostile aliens, I think it's best to keep a super-duper time machine away from the front lines.
I see, then you do have weapons, but you choose to keep them hidden.
Jenkins. Sir.
You will accompany the Doctor and take orders from him.
Yeah. I don't do orders, Any sign of trouble, get Jenkins to declare a Code Red.
And good luck, sir.
I said, "No salutes".
Now you're giving orders.
Getting a bit cheeky, you are.
Doctor.
Oh, just in time. Come on. Come on, we're going to the country.
Fresh air and geniuses. What more could you ask?
I'm not coming with you.
I've been thinking. I'm sorry.
I'm going home.
Really? I've got to.
Well, if that's what you want.
I mean, it's a bit soon.
Thad so many places I wanted to take you.
The Fifteenth Broken Moon of the Medusa Cascade.
The lightning skies of Cotter Palluni’s world.
The Diamond Coral Reefs of Kataa Flo Ko.
Thank you.
Thank you, Donna Noble. It's been brilliant. You've...
You saved my life in so many ways.
You're...
You're just popping home for a visit, that's what you mean.
You dumbo.
And then you're coming back.
D'you know what you are? A great big outer-space dunce.
“Yeah.
Ready when you are, sir.
What's more, you can give me a lift. Come on.
Broken Moon of what?
I know. I know.
And your name's Treppa, yeah? Is that Polish?
Listen, we're not checking passports. It's not about that, but...
Did you come across from Poland just to work?
I came to do my job.
Okay.
I need to listen to your heartbeat. This might be a bit cold.
Lift.
(HEART BEATING FAST) Are you on any medication? I'm here to work.
How many hours a day do you work?
24, You work 24 hours a day?
Down.
Mr Treppa, have you ever had any form of hypnosis?
I'm here to work.
Okay.
If you could just wait here.
MAN: Take those to the stores, Dr Jones.
Not now. I'm busy.
Just one question.
Do you have security clearance level one?
Yes, I do. Why?
Colonel Mace wants to see you.
Oh, good, ‘cause I want to see him. Where is he?
Come with us.
DONNA: I'll walk the rest of the way. I'll see you back at the factory, yeah?
DOCTOR: Bye. DONNA: And you be careful.
Haven't seen you for days.
Been away.
Help!
Hold on!
lam!
I'm waving at fat.
What's he doing down here?
He asked to see you.
Why? Has he found something?
(MARTHA SCREAMING) I said so, didn't I? Aliens! I said, they was real.
I just didn't expect them in a little blue box.
It's bigger on the inside.
Yeah, but is it safe?
This Doctor. Are you safe with him?
He's amazing, gramps. He's just dazzling.
And never tell him I said that.
No.
But I trust him with my life.
Hold up. I thought that was my job.
You still come first.
For God's sake, don't tell your mother.
I don't know.
I mean, this is massive.
It's sort of not fair if she doesn't know.
Doesn't know what? And who's she? The cat's mother?
And where have you been these past few days, lady?
After that silly little trick with the car keys, I phoned Veena and she said she hadn't seen hide nor hair.
I've just been travelling.
Oh, hark at her, Michael Palin.
Are you staying for tea? ‘Cause I haven't got anything in.
I've been trying to keep your grandad on that macrobiotic diet, but he sneaks off and gets pork pies at the petrol station.
Don't deny it. I've seen the wrappers in the car.
Oh, I don't miss a trick.
Now then, what were you going to tell me?
What don't I know?
Nothing.
Just nothing.
Good.
Right, then. You can sit there and cut out those coupons.
Every penny helps.
This new mortgage doesn't pay for itself.
Dad, kettle on.
Yeah. Kettle on.
UNIT's been watching the Rattigan Academy for ages.
It's all a bit Hitler Youth.
Exercise at dawn and classes and special diets.
SAT NAV: Turn left.
Ross, one question.
If UNIT think that Atmos is dodgy...
How come we've got it in the jeeps? Tell me about it.
They're fitted as standard on all government vehicles.
We can't get rid of them till we can prove there's something wrong.
Turn right.
Drives me around the bend.
Oh, nice one.
I timed that perfectly.
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
This is your final destination.
Is it PE? Wouldn't mind a kick around. I've got my daps on.
I suppose you're the Doctor. Hello, Your Commanding Officer phoned ahead.
Oh, I haven't got a Commanding Officer.
Have you?
Oh, this is Ross. Say hello, Ross.
Good afternoon, sir.
Let's have a look, then. I can smell genius... in a good way.
Oh, now!
That's clever, look.
A single-molecule fabric. How thin is that?
You could pack a tent in a thimble. Ooh! Gravity simulators.
Terraforming, biospheres, nano-tech steel construction.
(CHUCKLES) This is brilliant.
Do you know, with equipment like this you could, ooh, I don't know, move to another planet or something?
If only that was possible.
If only that were possible.
Conditional clause.
I think you'd better come with me.
You're smarter than the usual UNIT grunts.
I'll give you that.
He called you a grunt.
Don't call Ross a grunt. He's nice. We like Ross. Look at this place.
What exactly do you want?
I was just thinking, what a responsible 18 year old.
Inventing zero-carbon cars.
Saving the world.
It takes a man with vision.
Hmm! Blinkered vision.
‘Cause Atmos means more people driving.
More cars, more petrol.
End result, the oil's going to run out faster than ever.
The Atmos system could make things worse.
Yeah. Well, see, that's a tautology.
You can't say Atmos system because it stands for “Atmospheric Omission System”.
So you're saying Atmospheric Omission System System.
Do you see Mr Conditional Clause?
It's been a long time since anyone said no to you, isn’t it?
I'm still right though.
Not easy, is it? Being clever?
You look at the world and you connect things, random things, and think, why can't anyone else see it?
The rest of the world is so slow.
Yeah.
You're on your own.
I know.
But not with this. ‘Cause there's no way you invented this single-handedly.
Might be Earth technology, but that's like finding a mobile phone in the Middle Ages. No. No. I'll tell you what it's like.
It's like finding this in the middle of someone's front room, albeit a very big front room.
Why, what is it?
Nah!
This looks like a thing, doesn’t it?
People don't question things. You say, “It's a thing." Leave it alone.
Me, I make these connections, and this, to me, looks like a teleport pod.
(OSCILLATING DRONE) TANNOY: Orbit now holding at 556.3.
Oh.
Sector two, 7-0.
We have an intruder.
DOCTOR: How did he get in? Intruder window?
Bye, bye.
(OSCILLATING DRONE) Ross, get out! Luke, you'd better come with me.
Sontaran!
That's your name, isn't it? You're a Sontaran.
How did I know that, eh? Fascinating, isn’t it?
Isn't that worth keeping me alive?
I order you to surrender in the name of the Unified Intelligence Task Force.
That's not going to work. Cordolaine signal, am I right?
Copper excitations stopping the bullets.
How do you know so much? Well...
Who is he?
He didn't give his name.
Now this isn't typical Sontaran behaviour, is it? Hiding.
Using teenagers? Stopping bullets?
A Sontaran should face bullets with dignity. Shame on you.
You dishonour me, sir.
Yeah? Then show yourself.
I will look into my enemy's eyes.
Oh, my God.
And your name?
General Staal, of the 10th Sontaran Fleet.
Staal the Undefeated.
Oh, that’s not a very good nickname. What if you do get defeated?
Staal the not-so-quite-undefeated any more, but never mind?
He looks like a potato, a baked potato, a talking baked potato.
Now, Ross, don't be rude. You look like a pink weasel to him.
The Sontarans are the finest soldiers in the galaxy.
Dedicated to a life of warfare. A clone race.
Grown in batches of millions with only one weakness.
Sontarans have no weakness.
No. It's a good weakness.
Thought you were meant to be clever. Only an idiot would provoke him.
No, but the Sontarans are fed by a Probic Vent in the back of their neck.
That's their weak spot, which means they always have to face their enemies in battle. Isn't that lovely?
They can never turn their back.
We stare into the face of death.
Yeah, well stare at this.
(GENERAL STAAL SCREAMING) What have you done? What have you done?
Don't touch me.
A Sontaran would rather be court-martialled than show pain.
I must return.
But he broke the teleport.
Ha! Primitive sonic trickery.
The device is now repaired.
(OSCILLATING DRONE) Our presence is known. Soldiers, we move to a war footing.
I see you faced battle open-skinned, sir. Might I share that honour?
You may.
Thank you.
How do you tell each other apart?
We say the same of humans.
Tell me, boy, how many Atmos devices have been installed?
Ah! They've gone worldwide with only about half.
Which means 400 million cars converted. A fine arsenal.
Is it sufficient to trigger the conversion?
More than enough, yeah. And the test signal proved that it works.
52 deaths in the same second, man. That is just so cool.
Is the temperature significant?
No. That's just a phrase.
But I'll get my people ready, General. Just tell me where and when.
Have we infiltrated UNIT?
The process is about to begin.
Then you'll see it completed, Commander Skorr.
Get to it.
Yes, sir.
Is someone going to tell me what the hell is going on?
Okay.
So, listen.
You're not the first aliens I've met. Just tell me who you are.
Commander Skorr of the 10th Sontaran Battle Fleet, known as Skorr, the Blood Bringer.
What have you done to those two?
Simple hypnotic control, as with the factory drones.
But with you, we need something more complex.
(MACHINE BUZZING) What is that?
Soon, that will be you.
(INDISTINCT SPEAKING ON PA SYSTEM) Continue.
War can never come too soon.
Take your last look, boy.
It was never big enough for me.
I like your ambition.
That Doctor, he was in a UNIT jeep. It should have Atmos installed.
You said you didn't know his name.
I don't. He just said Doctor. Does that mean something?
There is an enemy of the Sontarans known as the Doctor.
A face changer.
Do you mean he is an alien, too?
Legend says he led the battle in the last great Time War.
The finest war in history and we weren't allowed to be part of it.
Oh, but this is excellent.
The last of the Time Lords will die at the hands of the Sontaran Empire in the ruins of his precious Earth.
It is inadvisable to struggle. The female has a weak thorax.
But what are you doing?
Completing mental transfer.
The clone needs full memory access. ~Clone?
No, you can’t.
That's not...
You'll sleep, girl.
Sleep and keep the memories alive.
Memories we can use in battle, SKREE: We have the Doctor's vehicle.
An ordinary death for such a remarkable enemy.
But proceed.
Greyhound 40 to Trap One. Repeat. Can you hear me? Over.
Why is it not working?
Must be the Sontarans.
If they can trace that, they can isolate the Atmos.
~SAT NAV: Turn left.
Try going right.
It said left.
I know, so go right.
I've got no control. It's driving itself.
It won't stop. The doors are locked.
Aah! It's deadlocked. I can't stop it.
Let me...
Turn left.
The sat nav's just a box. It's wired into the whole car.
Is he going in the water? I love it when they hit the water.
We're heading for the river.
Atmos, are you programmed to contradict my orders?
Confirmed.
Anything I say, you'll ignore it.
Confirmed.
Then drive into the river. I order you to drive me into the river.
Do it. Drive into the river.
Turn right. Left.
Get down.
Left, right, left, right...
Oh, is that it?
Atmos terminated. Mission accomplished. The Doctor is dead.
Then prepare the weapons.
Is the operative in place?
Ready and waiting to advance the great Sontaran cause, sir.
Then go to work.
(BELL RINGING) You would not believe the day I'm having.
I'll requisition us a vehicle.
Anything without Atmos.
And don't point your gun at people.
Is it him? Is it him? Is it the Doctor?
Oh, it's you.
Who? Oh!
It's you.
What, have you met before?
Yeah. Christmas Eve, He disappeared right in front of me.
And you never said.
Well, you never said.
Wilf, sir. Wilfred Mott. You must be one of them aliens, Yeah, but don't shout it out. Nice to meet you properly, Wilf.
Ah, an alien hand.
Donna, anything?
She's not answering. What is it, Sonterruns?
Sontarans. But there's got to be more to it.
They can't just be remote-controlling cars. That's not enough.
Is anyone answering?
Hold on.
Don't tell me. Donna Noble.
Martha. Hold on, he's here.
Martha, tell Colonel Mace it's the Sontarans, They're in the file. Code Red Sontarans.
But if they're inside the factory, tell him not to start shooting.
UNIT will get massacred.
I'll get back as soon as I can. You got that?
Code Red Sontaran. Gotcha.
Dr Jones, found anything yet?
No, sir. Nothing to report.
You tried sonicking it before and you didn't find anything.
Yeah, but now I know it's Sontaran, I know what I'm looking for.
The thing is, Doctor, that Donna is my only grandchild.
You got to promise me you're going to take care of her.
She takes care of me.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
Doctor, it's Martha.
And I'm bringing you back to Earth.
52 deaths at the exact same moment worldwide, They were all inside their cars.
They were all fitted with Atmos.
Atmos can be threaded through any and every make of car.
Get back.
Then they've got poisonous gas in every car on Earth.
Sontaran!
General Staal, of the 10th Sontaran Fleet.
Oh, this is Ross. Say hello, Ross.
Good afternoon, sir.
What is that?
Soon, that will be you.
Now we begin.
Martha, tell Colonel Mace it's the Sontarans, They're in the file. Code Red Sontarans.
But if they're inside the factory, tell him not to start shooting.
UNIT will get massacred.
Code Red Sontaran. Gotcha.
Found anything yet?
Nothing to report.
Prepare the subjugation of Earth.
(CHANTING) Sontar-ha!
ALL: (CHANTING) Sontar-ha!
(COUGHING AND CHOKING) DONNA: Doctor!
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) DONNA: Doctor! Doctor!
It won't open!
Well, don't just stand there. Get him out.
All soldiers to a door.
Make the factory secure, and take positions on the ground floor!
Wicowsky, take the soldiers into the factory.
Make the area secure. Seal off doors and windows.
We've tried everything! It just won't stop!
What have we got?
Atmos is running wild, sir.
It can't be stopped. It's everywhere. The whole planet.
Thanks.
I can't believe you've got an axe.
Burglars.
Get inside the house. Just try to close off the doors and windows.
Doctor, this is all I could find that hasn't got Atmos.
Donna, are you coming?
Yeah.
Donna, don't go!
Look what happens every time that Doctor appears.
Stay with us, please.
You go, my darling.
Dad!
Don't listen to her!
You go with the Doctor! That's my girl!
Bye!
(ALARM BLARING) Success. The operative has the necessary information.
Good work, for a female, Now she must be protected.
I will prepare an attack squad.
This is it, isn't it?
Oh, man, this is war!
And how does it feel, boy?
Magnificent.
The government has declared a state of emergency.
People are being told to stay away from all cars with Atmos devices attached.
The gas appears to be toxic.
We are warning anyone and everyone, stay away from the cars.
Repeat, stay away from your cars.
Ross, look after yourself. Get inside the building.
Will do.
Greyhound 40, this is Trap One.
I've just returned the Doctor to base, safe and sound. Over.
Trap One, received. Over.
Sir, a message from the Doctor. He says Code Red Sontaran.
All troops, Code Red Sontaran. Code Red Sontaran.
The air is disgusting.
It's not so bad for me. Go on, get inside the Tardis.
Oh! I've never given you a key.
Keep that. Go on, that’s yours. Quite a big moment, really.
Yeah, maybe we'll get sentimental after the world’s finished choking to death.
Good idea.
Where are you going?
To stop a war!
(COUGHING) Fine then, here I am!
Good. Whatever you do, Colonel Mace, do not engage the Sontarans in battle.
There is nothing they like better than a war.
Just leave this to me.
And what are you going to do?
I've got the Tardis. I'm going to get on board their ship.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING) Come on.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING) Ready for transport.
(CRASHING) The spoils of war!
The Doctor's infamous vessel in Sontaran hands.
It's time I made a move, sir.
I have soldiers of my own.
I'll tell them of the honour and the glory, sir.
I'll tell them the planetfall is coming.
He is behaving exactly as predicted, sir.
None of the humans can guess our true purpose.
But where's the Tardis?
Taste that, in the air.
Blah, blah, that sort of metal tang.
Teleport exchange.
It's the Sontarans. They've taken it.
I'm stuck on Earth, like...
Like an ordinary person, like a human. How rubbish is that?
Sorry, no offence, but, come on!
So, what do we do?
Well...
I mean, it's shielded, they could never detect it.
What?
I was just wondering, have you phoned your family and Tom?
No. What for?
The gas. Tell them to stay inside.
Course I will, yeah, but what about Donna?
I mean, where's she?
Oh, she's gone home.
She's not like you. She's not a soldier.
Right, so, avanti!
Leave it!
Turn away!
Civilisation is falling.
But it's all over the news, sir. It's everywhere.
Paris and New York...
It's time I told you. All of you!
It's time I revealed what our work has been for.
Change of plan!
Good to have you fighting alongside us, Doctor.
Not fighting.
I'm not-fighting, as in not-hyphen-fighting. Got it?
Now, does anyone know what this gas is yet?
We're working on it.
It's harmful, but not lethal until it reaches 80% density.
We're having the first reports of deaths from the centre of Tokyo city.
Who are you?
Captain Marion Price, sir.
Oh, put your hand down. Don't salute.
Jodrell Bank's traced the signal, Doctor, coming from 5,000 miles above the Earth.
We're guessing that's what triggered the cars.
The Sontaran ship.
NATO's gone to DEFCON 1. We're preparing a strike.
You can't do that. Nuclear missiles won't even scratch the surface.
Let me talk to the Sontarans, You're not authorised to speak on behalf of the Earth.
I've got that authority. I earned that a long time ago.
Calling the Sontaran command ship, under Jurisdiction 2 of the Intergalactic Rules of Engagement.
This is the Doctor.
Doctor, I'm here! Can you hear me?
Doctor, breathing your last?
My God, they're like trolls.
Yeah, loving the diplomacy, mate.
So, tell me, General Staal, since when did you lot become cowards?
How dare you?
Oh, that's diplomacy.
Doctor, you impugn my honour!
Yeah, I'm really glad you didn't say “belittle” ‘cause then I'd have a field day.
But poison gas? That's the weapon of a coward and you know it.
Staal, you could blast this planet out of the sky, and yet you're sitting up above watching it die.
Where's the fight in that?
Where's the honour?
Or, are you lot planning something else?
‘Cause this isn't normal Sontaran warfare.
What are you lot up to?
A general would be unwise to reveal his strategy to the opposing forces.
Ah, the war's not going so well, then. Losing, are we?
Such a suggestion is impossible!
What war?
The war between the Sontarans and the Rutans.
It's been raging, far out in the stars, for 50,000 years.
50,000 years of bloodshed, and for what?
For victory.
(CHANTING) Sontar-ha! Sontara-ha!
(ALL CHANTING) Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha! Sontara-ha!
Give me a break.
Boys and girls!
Doctor, I would seriously recommend that this dialogue is handled by official Earth representation.
Finished?
You will not be so quick to ridicule when you see our prize.
Behold!
We are the first Sontarans in history to capture a Tardis.
Well, as prizes go, that's noble.
As they say in Latin, dona nobis pacem.
That's me. I'm here!
Did you never wonder about its design? It's a phone box.
It contains a phone, a telephonic device for communication.
Sort of symbolic.
Like, if only we could communicate, you and I.
STAAL: All you have communicated is your distress, Doctor...
Oh, my God!
Big mistake, though, showing it to me.
But who do I phone?
‘Cause I've got a remote control.
Cease transmission!
Doctor, what number are you on?
You haven't even got a number!
Remove the box from the war room, beyond the transmission field.
Oh, well, that achieved nothing.
Oh, you'd be surprised.
(CRASHING) But what do I do?
All this stuff we've been building.
All this invention, where's it been heading?
Gravity densifiers, hydroponics, atmospheric conversion, eco-shells, more than enough to build a brand new world, Luke, we haven't got time for this. I've got to find my parents.
Oh, but this isn't just theory.
I'm talking planetfall, for all of us.
A brand new start for a brand new human race, Look.
A new world, far out, beyond Alpha Geminorum just waiting for us.
Its official designation is Castor 36.
I think of it as Earth-point-2.
I did wonder about Rattigan's World, but we can take a vote on that.
What the hell are you on about?
This is where we're going.
I have partners willing to take us there.
Oh, he's lost it. I haven't got time for this.
Excuse me, I haven't finished. Where are you going?
To find my brother.
I didn't say you could leave.
I told him to put Atmos in his car.
I've got to go and help him.
Stay where you are!
What do you think you're doing?
Luke, put that down.
But...
I did this for you. Don't you see?
We've spent all our lives excluded, the clever ones.
They laughed at us and pulled us down, those ordinary people out there, those cattle.
This is our chance to leave them behind.
You mean you want them dead?
And I choose you to survive.
With planetfall, we can start again.
We can build and breed. We can prosper. We can do anything!
We're going to breed?
I've designed a mating program.
I've planned the whole thing.
Well, then, shoot me.
Stay where you are.
Stay where you are, I said.
Stay where you are! Stay where you are! That's an order!
Castor 36?
You're just sick.
I guess that just proves it.
I'm cleverer than you!
I'm cleverer than everyone! Do you hear me?
I'm clever!
The United Nations has issued a directive worldwide, telling urban populations to stay indoors.
Those in rural areas are being ordered to stay away from all major cities.
There are reports from every country in Europe of thousands of people walking across country to escape.
And on the Eastern Seaboard of America, it's said to be reminiscent of Dunkirk, with boats taking refugees out into the Atlantic.
With the freeways blocked by Atmos cars, populations of major cities are now walking across open country to escape the fumes.
It is being likened to a Biblical plague.
Some are calling this the End of Days.
DONNA: Mum, you all right?
Donna! Where are you, sweetheart?
Is that her?
Oh, just finish the job.
Your granddad's sealing us in. He's sealing the windows.
Our own house, and we're sealed in.
All those things they said about pollution and ozone and carbon, they're really happening, aren't they?
There's people working on it, Mum. They're gonna fix it, I promise.
Oh, like you'd know. You're so clever.
Oh, don't start.
Please, don't.
I'm sorry.
I wish you were here.
Oh, come on, Sylvia. Look, that doesn't help.
Donna, where are you?
It's sort of hard to say. You all right?
Yeah, fighting fit, yeah. Is he with you, the Doctor?
SYLVIA: Oh, the Doctor.
No.
I'm all on my own.
Look, you promised he was going to look after you.
He will, Gramps.
There's something he needs me to do. I just don't know what.
Well, I mean, the whole place is covered, the whole of London, they're saying, and now the whole world.
It's the scale of it, Donna. I mean, how can one man stop all that?
Trust me, he can do it.
Yeah, well, if he doesn't, you tell him he'll have to answer to me.
I will.
Just as soon as I see him.
Tl tell him.
(GASPING) (COUGHING) Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, but 10% unidentified.
Some sort of artificial heavy element we can't trace.
You ever seen anything like it?
Must be something the Sontarans invented.
This isn't just poison. They need this gas for something else.
What could that be?
Launch grid online and active.
Positions, ladies and gentlemen. DEFCON 1 initiatives in progress.
What? I told you not to launch!
The gas is at 60% density. 80% and people start dying, Doctor.
We've got no choice.
Launching in 60, 59, 58, 57, 56...
Worldwide nuclear grid now coordinating in 54, 53...
Ha! The planet is going nuclear! I admire them.
The bravery of idiots is bravery, nonetheless.
The operative is in place, sir.
Commander Skorr, is the attack squad ready?
Ready and eager for battle, sir. We've been watching for long enough.
It'll be good to taste blood.
You're making a mistake, Colonel.
For once, I hope the Sontarans are ahead of you.
North America, online. United Kingdom, online.
France, online. India, online, Pakistan, online. China, online. North Korea, online.
All systems locked and coordinated.
Launching in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...
God save us, A, 3,2, 1,0.
What is it? What happened?
Did we launch? Well, did we?
Negative, sir.
The launch codes have been wiped, sir. It must be the Sontarans.
Can we override it?
Trying it now, sir.
Missiles wouldn't even dent that ship, so why are the Sontarans so keen to stop you?
Any ideas?
How should I know?
Now, protect the operative.
Stinking out there.
Shh! Keep it down, lads.
Enemy within! At arms!
Greyhound 40 declaring absolute emergency.
Sontarans within factory grounds. East corridor, grid 6.
Absolute emergency. Declaring Code Red. All troops, Code Red.
Get them out of there.
All troops, open fire.
The guns aren't working.
Inform all troops, standard weapons do not work.
(SCREAMING) Tell the Doctor it's that Cordolaine signal.
He's the only one who can stop them.
(STATIC ON RADIO) Greyhound 40, report. Over.
Greyhound 40, report.
Greyhound 40, report.
He wasn't Greyhound 40. His name was Ross.
Now listen to me, and get them out of there!
Trap One, to all stations. Retreat.
Order imperative. Immediate retreat.
Retreat! Retreat!
Reporting for duty, sir.
This is too easy.
They're running like slimebait from a speelfox.
This isn't war! This is sport!
They've taken the factory.
Why? They don't need it. Why attack now? What are they up to?
At times like this, I could do with the Brigadier.
No offence.
None taken. Sir Alistair's a fine man, if not the best.
Unfortunately, he's stranded in Peru.
Launch grid back online.
They're inside the system, sir.
It's coming from within UNIT itself.
Trace it. Find out where it's coming from, and quickly.
Gas levels?
66% in major population areas, and rising.
Commander Skorr reports victory, with many glorious deaths.
Sorry to report, sir, I've failed.
They wouldn't come.
The students, they didn’t have the imagination to believe.
A pity.
We've lost our target practice.
What do you mean?
Upon arrival on board this ship, your students would have been shot down.
Perhaps they were more clever than you thought.
You promised.
There was no planetfall.
Castor 36, indeed!
We only needed you for installation of the Atmos system.
No, but I'm on your side.
I did everything you wanted.
And it's not “Atmos system”. That's a tautology. It's just “Atmos”.
Execute him!
A coward's retreat.
Now close all teleport links to Earth.
Isolate them as they perish!
(SOBBING) Why are they defending the factory only after we're inside?
Because they wanted UNIT here.
You gave them something they needed, something now hidden inside the factory, something precious.
Then we've got to recover it.
This Cordolaine signal thing, how does it work?
It's the bullets. It causes expansion of the copper shell.
Understood. I'm on it.
For the billionth time, you can't fight Sontarans!
A phone. Have you got a phone?
I need your mobile, quickly, hurry up.
(MOBILE RINGING) What's happened? Where are you?
Still on Earth, but don't worry, I've got my secret weapon.
And what's that?
You.
Hmm, somehow that's not making me happy.
Can't you just zap us down to Earth with that remote thing?
Yeah, I haven't got a remote, though.
I really should, but I need you on that ship.
That's why I made them move the Tardis.
I'm sorry, but you've got to go outside.
But there's Sonterruns out there.
Sontarans. But they'll be on battle stations right now.
They don't exactly walk about having coffee.
I can talk you through it.
But what if they find me?
I know, and I wouldn't ask, but there's nothing else I can do.
The whole planet is choking, Donna.
What do you need me to do?
The Sontarans are inside the factory, which means they've got a teleport link with the ship, and they'll have deadlocked it I need you to reopen the link.
I can't even mend a fuse.
Donna, stop talking about yourself like that.
You can do this, I promise.
There's a Sonterrun. A Sontaran.
Did he see you?
No, he's got his back to me.
Right, Donna, listen. On the back of his neck, on his collar, there's a sort of plug, like a hole, the Probic Vent.
One blow to the Probic Vent knocks them out.
But he's going to kill me.
I'm sorry. I swear, I'm so sorry, but you've got to try.
Back of the neck.
Now then, you've got to find the external junction feed to the teleport.
What does it look like?
Uh, circular panel on the wall, big symbol on the front, like a letter “T" with a horizontal line through it.
Or two "F's back to back.
Oh, well, there's a door.
Should be a switch by the side.
Yeah, there is.
But it's Sontaran-shaped, you need three fingers.
You've got three fingers.
Oh, yeah.
I'm through.
Oh, you are brilliant, you are.
Shut up.
Right, “T” with a line through it.
Gotta go. Keep the line open.
I said, you don’t stand a chance!
Positions. That means everyone.
You're not going without me.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Latest firing stock. What do you think, Doctor?
Are you my mummy?
If you could concentrate...
Bullets with a rad-steel coating, no copper surface, should overcome the Cordolaine signal.
But the Sontarans have got lasers.
You can't even see in this fog. The night-vision doesn't work.
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for your lack of faith.
But this time I'm not listening.
Attention, all troops.
Sontarans might think of us as primitive, as does every passing species with an axe to grind.
They make a mockery of our weapons, our soldiers, our ideals.
But no more.
From this point on, it stops.
From this point on, the people of Earth fight back.
And we show them.
We show the warriors of Sontar what the human race can do.
Trap One to Hawk Major, go, go, go!
(EXPLOSION) It's working. The area's clearing.
Engines to maximum!
It's the Valiant.
UNIT carrier ship Valiant reporting for duty, Doctor, with engines strong enough to clear away the fog.
(LAUGHING) That's brilliant!
Getting a taste for it, Doctor?
No, not at all. Not me.
Valiant, fire at will.
East and north secure. Doctor?
Donna, hold on, I'm coming.
Shouldn't we follow the Colonel?
Ah, you and me, Martha Jones, just like old times.
Alien technology, this way!
The honour of battle. The glory!
(DEVICE BEEPING) No Sontarans down here.
They can't resist a battle.
Here we go.
Oh, Martha, I'm so sorry.
Still alive.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Wish you carried a gun now?
Not at all.
I've been stopping the nuclear launch all this time.
Doing exactly what I wanted.
I needed to stop the missiles just as much as the Sontarans.
I'm not having Earth start an interstellar war. You're a triple agent.
When did you know?
About you? Oh, right from the start.
Reduced iris contraction, slight thinning of the hair follicles on the left temple, and frankly, you smell.
You might as well have worn a T-shirt saying "clone", although maybe not in front of Captain Jack.
You remember him, don't you? ‘Cause you've got all her memories.
That's why the Sontarans had to protect her, to keep you inside UNIT.
Martha Jones is keeping you alive.
Alright, all right, I'm here, I'm here, I've got you, I've got you.
There was this thing, Doctor, this alien, with this head...
(MOBILE RINGING) Blimey, I'm busy.
Got it?
Yes, Now hurry up.
Take off the covering.
All the blue switches inside, flick them up, like a fuse box.
And that should get the teleport working.
Oh, my God!
That's me.
You will face me, sir.
Wonderful.
Don't touch me.
It's not my fault.
The Sontarans created you, but you had all my memories.
You've got a brother, sister, mother and father.
If you don't help me, they're going to die.
You love them?
Yes.
Remember that?
The gas! Tell us about the gas!
He's the enemy!
Then tell me. It's not just poison. What's it for?
Martha, please!
Caesofine concentrate.
It's one part Bosteen, two parts Probic 5.
Clonefeed! It's clonefeed!
What's clonefeed?
Like amniotic fluid for Sontarans. That's why they're not invading.
They're converting the atmosphere, changing the planet into a clone world.
Earth becomes a very big hatchery ‘cause the Sontarans are clones.
That's how they reproduce.
Give them a planet this big, they'll create billions of new soldiers.
The gas isn't poison, it's food!
My heart, it's getting slower.
There's nothing I can do.
In your mind, you've got so many plans.
There's so much that you want to do.
And I will.
Never do tomorrow what you can do today, my mum says.
‘Cause you never know how long you've got.
Martha Jones, all that life.
Doctor!
Blue switches done.
But they've found me.
Now!
Have I ever told you how much I hate you?
Hold on! Hold on! Get off me! Get off me!
Got to bring the Tardis down.
Right. Now, Martha, are you coming?
What about this nuclear-launch thing?
Keep pressing “N". Want to keep those missiles on the ground.
There's two of them.
Yeah. Long story.
Here we go! The old team back together! Well, the new team.
We're not going back on that ship!
No, no, no, I need to get the teleport working so that we can get to...
Here. The Rattigan Academy, owned by...
Don't tell anyone what I did. It wasn't my fault.
The Sontarans lied to me. They...
If I see one more gun...
You know, that coat sort of works.
I feel like a kid in my dad's clothes.
Oh, well, if you're calling him Dad, you're definitely getting over him.
The human female on board ship. It could only be the Doctor's work, and all the teleport systems have been deadlocked open.
No matter. Increase the Atmos devices to maximum.
Choke them.
Behold, the clone world is born.
(COUGHING) Ah, my little girl. Come on, we'll be all right.
(SOBBING) We'll be all right. Donna said so. She promised.
Come on, darling. It’s all right.
That's why the Sontarans wanted to stop the missiles.
They were holding back.
Because the caesofine gas is volatile, that's why they had to use you to stop the nuclear attack.
Ground-to-air engagement could've sparked off the whole thing.
What, like set fire to the atmosphere?
Yeah, they need all the gas intact to breed their clone army.
And all the time, we had Luke here, in his dream factory.
Planning a little trip, were we?
They promised me a new world.
And you were building equipment, ready to terraform El Mondo Luko, so that humans could live there and breathe the air with this.
An atmospheric converter.
Prepare to launch clone pods.
We will breed across the surface of the Earth for the glory of Sontar!
That's London.
You can't even see it.
My family’s in there.
If I can get this on the right setting...
Doctor, hold on. You said the atmosphere would ignite.
Yeah, I did, didn't 1?
Please, please, please, please, please, please.
General Staal, sir...
What's happening?
(PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) (WHISTLING) (ALL CHEERING) He's a genius.
Just brilliant.
Now we're in trouble, It seems we must revert to basic Sontaran stratagem 1.
We will ravage this planet.
Prepare weapons, wipe them out! Every last stinking human beast!
Right. So, Donna, thank you for everything.
Martha, you, too. Oh...
So many times.
Luke, do something clever with your life.
You're saying goodbye.
Sontarans are never defeated.
They'll be getting ready for war.
And well, you know, I've recalibrated this for Sontaran air, so...
You're going to ignite them?
You'll kill yourself.
Just send that thing up on its own. I don't know. Put it on a delay.
I can't.
Why not?
I've got to give them a choice.
Oh, excellent!
General Staal, you know what this is.
But there's one more option. You can go. Just leave.
Sontaran High Command need never know what happened here.
Your stratagem would be wise if Sontarans feared death, but we do not.
At arms!
I'll do it, Staal. If it saves the Earth, I'll do it.
A warrior doesn't talk. He acts.
I am giving you the chance to leave.
And miss the glory of this moment?
All weapons targeting Earth, sir. Firing in 20.
I'm warning you!
And I salute you!
Take aim!
Shoot me, I'm still going to press this. You'll die, Staal.
Knowing that you died, too.
Firing in 15.
For the glory of Sontar!
(ALL CHANTING) Sontar-ha!
(ALL CHANTING) Sontar-ha!
I'll do it! I'll do it!
(CIRCUITRY CHIRPING) What are you doing?
Something clever.
(ALL CHANTING) Sontar-ha!
... nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
(CHANTING) Sontar-ha!
On Me, Morning.
Morning.
Walked all the way. Won't catch me driving.
The streets are half empty. People still aren't driving.
There's kids on bikes all over the place. It's wonderful.
Unpack that, love. I'm going to see if Suzette's all right.
I won't tell her. Best not.
Just keep it as our little secret, eh?
Yeah.
And you go with him, that wonderful Doctor.
You go and see the stars.
And then bring a bit of them back for your old gramps.
Love you.
(SIGHING) How were they?
Oh...
Same old stuff.
They're fine.
So, you gonna come with us?
We're not exactly short of space.
Oh, I have missed all this, but, you know...
I'm good here, back at home.
And I'm better for having been away.
Besides, someone needs me.
Never mind the universe, I've got a great big world of my own now.
(SCREAMING) What? What?
Doctor, don't you dare!
No, no, I didn't touch anything!
We're in flight! It's not me!
Where are we going?
I don't know. It's out of control!
(MARTHA CRYING OUT) Doctor, just listen to me!
You take me home! Take me home right now!
Where did she come from?
From me.
From you?
How?
Well...
I'd like to see you try that.
She's my daughter.
Hello, Dad.  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
(GASPING AND SCREAMING) What the hell is he doing?
The controls aren't working.
I don't know where we're going, but my old hand's very excited about it.
I thought that was just some freaky alien thing.
Are you sure that it's yours? Well...
It got cut off. He grew a new one.
You are completely impossible.
I'm not impossible. Just a bit unlikely.
(SCREAMING) Why did the Tardis bring us here?
Oh, I love this bit.
I thought you wanted to go home.
I know, but all the same...
It's that feeling you get.
Like you swallowed a hamster.
SOLDIER: Don't move. Stay where you are!
Drop your weapons!
We're not armed.
Look, no weapons, never any weapons. We're safe.
Look at their hands. They're clean.
All right, process them. Him first.
Wait! Oi! What's wrong with clean hands?
MARTHA: What's going on? Leave him alone.
(GRUNTING) (MACHINE BUZZING) Something tells me this isn't about to check my blood pressure.
(SHOUTS) What are you doing to him?
Everyone gets processed.
It's taking a tissue sample.
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
An extrapolator here. Some kind of accelerator?
(MACHINE WHOOSHES) Are you all right?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
That's...
Arm yourself.
MARTHA: Where did she come from?
From me.
From you?
How?
Who is she?
DOCTOR: Well, she's...
Well...
She's my daughter.
Hello, Dad.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Are you primed to take orders, ready to fight?
Instant mental download of all strategic and military protocol, sir.
Generation 5000 soldier, primed and in peak physical health.
(COCKING GUN) Oh, I'm ready.
Did you say daughter?
Mmm. Technically.
Technically how?
Progenation, reproduction from a single organism.
It means one parent is biological mother and father.
You take a sample of diploid cells, split them into haploids, then recombine them in a different arrangement and grow, very quickly, apparently.
(CRASHING) Something's coming.
SOLDIER: It's the Hath!
Get down!
(GRUNTING) We have to blow the tunnel. Get the detonator!
We're not detonating anything.
(MUFFLED SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) SOLDIER: Grab it!
SOLDIER: Blow the thing!
Martha!
No. Don't!
(ALARM BLARING) You've sealed off the tunnel. Why did you do that?
They were trying to kill us.
But they've got my friend.
Collateral damage.
At least you've still got her. He lost both his men.
I'd say you came out ahead.
Her name is Martha.
And she's not collateral damage, not for anyone.
Have you got that, GI Jane?
I'm gonna find her.
(COCKING GUN) You're going nowhere.
You don’t make sense, you two. No guns, no marks, no fight in you.
I'm taking you to General Cobb. Now move.
(COUGHING) (CREATURE GURGLING) Hold on. I've got you. Is it your arm, yeah?
(CREATURE MOANING) Is that a yes?
(MOANS) Let me examine it. Keep still.
Still, yeah?
No move.
Half fish, half human.
How am I supposed to know? Is that a shoulder?
Feels like a shoulder. I think it's dislocated.
(DOOR OPENS) I'm trying to help him.
I am a doctor and he is my patient. And I'm not leaving him.
(GURGLING) Now this is gonna hurt.
One, two, three!
(GUNS COCKING) (CREATURE GRUNTS) Now then, I'm Dr Martha Jones. Who the hell are you?
I'm Donna. What's your name?
Don't know. It's not been assigned.
Well, if you don’t know that, what do you know?
How to fight.
Nothing else?
The machine must embed military history and tactics, but no name.
~She's a generated anomaly.
"Generated anomaly"?
Generated.
Well, what about that? Jenny.
Jenny. Yeah. I like that. Jenny.
What do you think, Dad?
Good as anything, I suppose.
You're not what you call a natural parent, are you?
They stole a tissue sample at gunpoint and processed it.
It's not what I'd call natural parenting.
Rubbish. My friend Neris fathered twins using a turkey baster.
It don't bother her.
Can I extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident?
Uh, Child Support Agency can.
Look, just ‘cause I share certain physiological traits with simian primates doesn't make me a monkey's uncle, does it?
I'm not a monkey... or a child.
So where are we? What planet's this?
Messaline. Well, what's left of it.
MAN ON PA: 6-6-3, 75 deceased.
Generation 6-6-7-1 extinct.
Generation 6-6-7-2, 46 deceased.
Generation 6-6-8-0, 14 deceased.
Generation 6...
This is a theatre.
Maybe they're doing Miss Saigon.
It's like a town or a city underground.
But why?
General Cobb, I presume.
Found in the western tunnels, I'm told, with no marks.
There was an outbreak of pacifism in the eastern zone, three generations back, before we lost contact.
Is that where you came from?
Eastern zone, that's us. Yeah, yeah. I'm the Doctor. This is Donna.
And I'm Jenny.
Don't think you can infect us with your peacemaking.
We're committed to the fight to the very end.
Well, that's all right. I can't stay anyway. I gotta go and find my friend.
That's not possible. All movement is regulated.
We're at war.
Yes. I noticed. With the Hath.
But tell me, ‘cause we got a bit out of circulation, eastern zone and all that, so who exactly are the Hath?
(CREATURE GRUNTS) (ALL GURGLING) COBB: Back at the dawn of this planet, these ancient halls were carved from the earth.
Our ancestors dreamt of a new beginning, a colony where human and Hath work and live together.
What happened?
The dream died, broken along with Hath promises.
They wanted it all for themselves.
But those early pioneers, they fought back.
They used the machines to produce soldiers instead of colonists and began this battle for survival.
There's nothing but earth outside. Why is that?
Why build everything underground?
The surface is too dangerous.
Well, then why build windows in the first place?
And what's this mean?
The rites and symbols of our ancestors.
The meanings lost in time.
How long has this war gone on for?
Longer than anyone can remember.
Countless generations marked only by the dead.
What, fighting all this time?
Because we must.
Every child of the machine is born with this knowledge.
It's our inheritance. It's all we know.
How to fight and how to die.
(MUTTERING AND GURGLING) Right. So we're here?
(SIGHING) Does this show the entire city, including the Hath side?
Yes. Why?
Well, it'll help us find Martha.
We've more important things to do.
The progenation machines are powered down for the night shift, but, as soon as they're active, we could breed a whole platoon from you two.
I'm not having sons and daughters by some great big flipping machine.
Sorry, no offence, but you're not... Well, I mean, you're not real.
(SCOFFS) You're no better than him.
I have a body, I have a mind, I have independent thought.
How am I not real? What makes you better than me?
Well said, soldier. We need more like you if ever we're to find the source, Ooh, the source. What's that then? What's the source?
I like a source. What is it?
The breath of life.
And that would be?
In the beginning, the Great One breathed life into the universe.
And then she looked at what she'd done and she sighed.
"She," | like that.
Right, so it's a creation myth.
It's not myth, it's real.
That sigh, from the beginning of time, it was caught and kept as the source.
It was lost when the war started, but it's here somewhere.
Whoever holds the source controls the destiny of this planet.
Ah! I thought so.
There's a suppressed layer of information in this map.
If I can just...
What is it? What does it mean?
See? A whole complex of tunnels hidden from sight.
Hold on. Look!
That must be the lost temple. The source will be inside.
You've shown us the way. And look, we're closer than the Hath.
It's ours.
That's a new map. There's a different set of tunnels.
Tell them to prepare to move out.
We'll progenate new soldiers on the morning shift, then we march.
Once we've reached the temple, peace will be restored at long last.
Call me old-fashioned, but if you really wanted peace, couldn't you just stop fighting?
Only when we have the source.
It will give us the power to erase every stinking Hath off the face of this planet.
Hang on, hang on. A second ago, it was peace in our time, now you're talking about genocide.
For us, that means the same thing.
Then you need to get yourself a better dictionary.
When you do, look up genocide.
You'll see a little picture of me there and the caption will read, “Over my dead body!" You're the one who showed us the path to victory, but you can consider the irony from your prison cell.
Cline, at arms.
Oi, oi, oi. All right. Cool the beans, Rambo.
COBB: Take them. I won't have them spreading treason.
And if you try anything, Doctor, I'll see that your woman dies first.
We're not a couple.
I'm not his woman.
Come on, this way.
I'm gonna stop you, Cobb. You need to know that.
I have an army and the breath of God on my side, Doctor.
What'll you have? This.
Lock 'em up and guard ‘em.
What about the new soldier?
We can't trust her. She's from pacifist stock. Take them all.
(LOUD GURGLING) But I didn’t do anything.
(GRUNTS) I think I just started a war.
More numbers. They've got to mean something.
Makes as much sense as the breath of life story.
You mean that's not true?
No. It's a myth, isn't it, Doctor?
Yes, but there could still be something real in that temple.
Something that's become a myth, a piece of technology, a weapon.
So the source could be a weapon and we've just given directions to Captain Nutjob?
Oh, yes.
Not good, is it?
That's why we need to get out of here, find Martha and stop Cobb from slaughtering the Hath.
(STAMMERING) What are you staring at?
You keep insisting you're not a soldier, but look at you, drawing up strategies like a proper general.
No, no. I'm trying to stop the fighting.
Isn't every soldier?
Well, I suppose, but that's...
That's... Technically. I haven't got time for this.
Donna, give me your phone. Time for an upgrade.
And now you've got a weapon.
It’s not a weapon.
But you're using it to fight back.
I'm gonna learn so much from you. You are such a soldier.
Donna, will you tell her?
Ooh, you are speechless.
I'm loving this. You keep on, Jenny.
(MOBILE RINGING) Doctor?
Martha, you're alive!
Doctor! Oh, am I glad to hear your voice.
Are you all right?
I'm with Donna. We're fine.
What about you?
And... And Jenny. She's fine, too.
Yes, all right. And... And...
Jenny. That's the woman from the machine, the soldier.
My daughter. Except she isn't, she's...
Anyway, where are you?
I'm in the Hath camp.
I'm okay, but something's going on. The Hath are all marching off to some place that's appeared on this map thing.
Oh. That was me.
If both armies are heading that way, there's gonna be a bloodbath.
What do you want me to do?
Just stay where you are.
If you're safe there, don't move, do you hear?
But I can help.
(BUSY SIGNAL BEEPING) Doctor? Doctor?
The doors that have been closed will be open to us now.
The door to the temple, to the source and to victory.
COBB: Come the dawn cycle, we march!
ALL: To war with the Hath!
They're getting ready to move out. We have to get past that guard.
I can deal with him.
No, no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.
What?
You belong here with them.
She belongs with us.
With you. She's your daughter.
She's a soldier. She came out of that machine.
Oh, yes. I know that bit. Listen, have you got that stethoscope?
Give it to me. Come on.
(DOCTOR SIGHING) What are you doing?
It's all right.
Just hold still.
Come here.
Listen, and then tell me where she belongs.
(HEART BEATING) (MORE BEATING) Two hearts.
DONNA: Exactly.
What's going on?
Does that mean she’s a... What do you call a female Time Lord?
What's a Time Lord?
It's who I am. It's where I'm from.
And I'm from you?
You're an echo, that's all. A Time Lord is so much more.
A sum of knowledge, a code, a shared history, a shared suffering.
And it's gone now, all of it.
Gone forever.
What happened?
There was a war.
Like this one?
Bigger. Much bigger.
And you fought?
And killed?
Yes.
Then how are we different?
I need to charge it up. I need power. Do you understand?
(GURGLING) There's even more. In 3D! Oh, you're a clever Hath!
So this is where everybody's headed?
(HATH GURGLING) But look, those tunnels sort of zig-zag.
If I went up and over the surface in a straight line, I'd get there first.
Why not?
Are these the readings for the surface? But it doesn't look too bad.
Nitrogen and oxygen about 80-20.
That's fine. Ozone levels are high and some big radiation spikes.
But as long as I'm not out there too long...
I have to find my friends.
Come on, then.
Hey.
I'm not supposed to talk to you. I'm on duty.
Yeah, I know. Guarding me.
So does that mean I'm dangerous or that I need protecting?
Protecting from what?
Ooh, I don't know. Men like you.
Keep quiet and open the door.
I'd like to see you try that.
(WHISPERING) That's the way out.
Don't you dare.
Let me distract this one.
I have picked up a few womanly wiles over the years.
Let's save your wiles for later, in case of emergency.
(SQUEAKING) I was gonna distract him, not clobber him.
Well, it worked, didn't it?
I still have a copy of that new map. Just stay there. Don't hurt anyone.
(MOUSE SQUEAKING) (EXCLAIMS) (GURGLING) You can stay down here and live your whole life in the shadows or come with me and stand in the open air, feel the wind on your face.
What's it gonna be?
(MOANING) It's up to you, but nothing's gonna stop me.
(GRUNTING) (EXCLAIMS) (GASPING) I knew you couldn't resist it.
(GURGLING) Er, language!
Come on.
It was the girl. She tricked me. They... They got away. I'm sorry.
I've waited all my life for this moment.
No one's gonna get in my way, certainly not this Doctor.
Alarm! We march!
To war!
Wait!
This is it. The hidden tunnel.
There must be a control panel.
There's another one of those numbers. They're everywhere.
DOCTOR: The original builders must have left them.
An old cataloguing system.
You got a pen, a bit of paper?
‘Cause, do you see? The numbers are counting down.
This one ends in 1-4. The prison cell said 1-6.
Always thinking, both of you. Who are you people?
I told you, I'm the Doctor. The Doctor, that's it?
“That's all he ever says.
So you don't have a name either?
Are you an anomaly, too? “No.
Oh, come off it. You're the most anomalous bloke I've ever known.
Here it is!
And Time Lords, what are they for exactly?
For? They're net... They're not for anything.
~So what do you do?
I travel through time and space.
He saves planets, rescues civilisations defeats terrible creatures and runs a lot.
Seriously, there's an outrageous amount of running involved.
Great!
COBB: Support 5, with me.
No. What were you saying about running?
That's not mood lighting, is it?
No. I didn't think so.
Arming device.
There's more of these.
Always eight numbers, counting down the closer we get.
(GRUNTS) Here we go.
DONNA: You'd better be quick. The general.
Where are you going?
I can hold them up.
No. We don't need any more dead.
But it's them or us.
It doesn't mean you have to kill them.
I'm trying to save your life.
Listen to me, the killing, after a while it infects you and once it does you're never rid of it.
But we don't have a choice.
We always have a choice.
I'm sorry. Jenny!
SOLDIER: This door, now!
SOLDIER: Right, there she is! Come on!
Told you. Nothing but a soldier.
She's trying to help.
You must increase your fire!
DOCTOR: Jenny, come on!
I'm coming.
Cease-fire! Cease-fire.
That's it.
Jenny, leave it. Let's go!
COBB: You're a child of the machine. You're on my side.
Join us. Join us in the war against the Hath.
It's in your blood, girl. Don't deny it.
Jenny, come on!
“That's it!
Hurry up!
Oh, no, no, no, no. The circuits moved back.
Zap it back again!
The controls are back there.
They're coming!
Wait! Just...
There isn't... Jenny, I can't...
I'll have to manage on my own.
Watch and learn, Father.
No way.
But that was impossible.
Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely.
Brilliant. You were brilliant! Brilliant!
I didn't kill him. General Cobb. I could've killed him, but I didn't.
You were right. I had a choice.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING) I warned you, Cobb.
If the source is a weapon, I'm gonna make sure you never use it.
One of us is gonna die today and it won't be me.
It can't be much further.
(PANTING) (SCREAMS) (GURGLING) (COUGHING) Help me!
I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Help me peg!
Help me! Help me! Help me peg!
Help! I'm sinking!
(CRYING) (GRUNTING) (MOANING AND GURGLING) No!
No!
So you travel together, but you're not together.
What? No, no, no way. No, no. We're friends, that's all.
I mean, we're not even the same species. There's probably laws against it.
And what's it like, the travelling?
Oh, never a dull moment.
It can be terrifying, brilliant and funny, sometimes all at the same time.
I've seen some amazing things though. A whole new world.
Oh, I'd love to see new worlds.
You will.
Won't she, Doctor?
Hmm?
Do you think Jenny will see any new worlds?
I suppose so.
You mean... You mean you'll take me with you?
Well, we can't leave you here, can we?
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Come on. Let's get a move on.
Careful, there might be traps.
Kids, they never listen.
Oh, I know that look. See it a lot round our way.
Blokes with pushchairs and frowns. You've got dad shock.
Dad shock?
Sudden, unexpected fatherhood.
It'll take a bit of getting used to.
No, It's not that.
Well, what is it then? Having Jenny in the Tardis, is that it?
What's she gonna do? Cramp your style?
Like, you've got a sports car, she's gonna turn it into a people carrier?
Donna, I've been a father before.
What?
I lost all that a long time ago, along with everything else.
I'm sorry. I didn’t know.
Why didn't you tell me?
You talk all the time, but you don't say anything.
I know. Just...
When I look at her now, I can see them, the hole they Left, all the pain that filled it.
Just don't know if I can face that every day.
It won't stay like that. She'll help you. We both will.
When they died, that part of me died with them.
It'll never come back, not now.
I'll tell you something, Doctor, something I've never told you before.
I think you're wrong.
(LASERS BLASTING) They've blasted through the beams. Time to run again.
Love the running. Yeah?
Love the running.
(MARTHA CRYING) (GUNS FIRING) DONNA: We're trapped.
Can't be.
This must be the temple. This is a door.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING) And again. We're down to 1-2 now.
I got it!
I can hear them.
Nearly done!
This can't be a cataloguing system.
They're getting closer.
Then get back here.
They're too similar.
JENNY: Not yet.
Too familiar.
Now!
Got it!
They're coming.
Close the door.
That was close.
No fun otherwise.
It's not what I'd call a temple.
It looks more like...
Fusion-drive transport.
It's a spaceship.
What, the original one?
The one the first colonists arrived on?
Well, it could be, but the power cells would have run down after all that time.
This one’s still powered up and functioning.
Come on!
It's the Hath. That door's not gonna last much longer.
And if General Cobb gets through down there, war's gonna break out.
Look, look, look, look!
Ship's log.
First wave of human-Hath co-colonisation of Planet Messaline, So it is the original ship?
What happened?
There's one construction.
They used robot drones to build the city.
But does it mention the war?
DOCTOR: Final entry, "Mission commander dead.
“Still no agreement on who should assume leadership.
“Hath and humans have divided into factions." That must be it. A power vacuum.
The crew divided into two factions, then turned on each other.
Start using the progenation machines, suddenly you've got two armies fighting a never-ending war.
Two armies who are now both outside.
Look at that!
It's like the numbers in the tunnels.
No, no, no, but listen.
I spent six months working as a temp in Hounslow Library and I mastered the Dewey Decimal System in two days flat.
I'm good with numbers. It's staring us in the face.
What is?
It's the date.
Assuming the first two numbers are some big old space date, then you've got year, month, day.
It's the other way round, like it is in America.
Oh, it's the new Byzantine calendar!
The codes are completion dates for each section.
They finish it, they stamp the date on.
So the numbers aren't counting down.
They're going out from here day by day as the city got built.
Yes. Oh, good work, Donna!
Yeah, but you're still not getting it.
The first number I saw back there was 60-12-07-17.
Well, look at the date today.
0-7-24... No.
What does it mean?
Seven days.
That's it!
~Seven days.
Seven days.
What do you mean, “seven days"?
Seven days since war broke out.
This war started seven days ago. Just a week. A week.
They said years.
No. They said generations.
And if they're all like you and they're products of those machines...
They could have 20 generations in a day.
Each generation gets killed in the war, passes on the legend.
Oh, Donna, you're a genius!
But all the buildings, the encampments, they're in ruins.
They're not ruined, they're just empty, waiting to be populated.
Oh, they've mythologized their entire history.
The source must be part of that, too. Come on!
Doctor!
Martha!
Oh, I should've known you wouldn't stay away from all the excitement.
Donna!
Ooh, you're filthy. What happened?
I took the surface route.
(COBB SHOUTING) That's the General. We haven't got much time.
We don't even know what we're looking for.
Is it me or can you smell flowers? “Yes.
Bougainvillea.
I say we follow our nose.
(COBB SHOUTING) Oh, yes!
Yes!
Isn't this brilliant?
Is that the source?
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Terraforming.
It's a third-generation terraforming device.
So why are we suddenly in Kew Gardens? ‘Cause that's what it does.
All this, only bigger, much bigger. It's in a transit state.
Producing all this must help keep it stable before they find...
(CRASHING) Stop! Hold your fire!
What is this, some kind of trap?
You said you wanted this war over.
I want this war won!
You can't win. No one can.
You don't even know why you're here.
Your whole history, it's just Chinese whispers, getting more distorted the more it's passed on.
This is the source.
This is what you're fighting over, a device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem.
It's nothing mystical.
It's from a laboratory, not some creator.
It's a bubble of gases, a cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution.
Methane, hydrogen, ammonia, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids.
It's used to make barren planets habitable.
Look around you.
It's not for killing. It's for bringing life.
If you allow it, it can lift you out of these dark tunnels and into the bright, bright sunlight.
No more fighting, no more killing.
I'm the Doctor and I declare this war is over.
What's happening?
The gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process.
What does that mean?
It means a new world.
No!
Jenny. Jenny. Talk to me, Jenny.
Is she gonna be all right?
A new world.
It's beautiful.
Jenny, please hold on. You need to hold on, do you hear me?
We've got things to do, you and me, eh? Eh?
We can go anywhere.
Everywhere. You choose.
That sounds good.
You're my daughter and we've only just got started.
You're gonna be great.
You're gonna be more than great.
You're gonna be amazing. Do you hear me, Jenny?
Two hearts.
Two hearts, just like me.
If we wait, we just wait...
There's no sign, Doctor.
There's no regeneration. She's like you, but maybe not enough.
No. Too much.
That's the truth of it.
She was too much like me.
I never would.
Have you got that?
I never would.
When you start this new world, this world of human and Hath, remember that!
Make the foundation of this society a man who never would!
It's happening. The terraforming.
Build a city nice and safe underground, strip away the top soil and there it is.
And what about Jenny?
Let us give her a proper ceremony.
I think it would help us. Please.
Jenny was the reason for the Tardis bringing us here.
It just got here too soon, which then created Jenny in the first place.
Paradox. An endless paradox.
Time to go home.
Yeah. Home.
(TARDIS RUMBLING) Are you sure about this?
Yeah. Positive.
I can't do this any more. You'll be the same one day.
Not me, never.
How could I ever go back to normal life after seeing all this?
I'm gonna travel with that man forever.
Good luck.
And you.
We're making a habit of this.
Yeah, and you'd think it'd get easier.
All those things you've been ready to die for.
I thought for a moment there you'd finally found something worth living for.
Oh, there's always something worth living for, Martha.
Bye, Doctor.
Goodbye, Dr Jones.
Hello, boys.
(WHOOSHING) The shuttle.
Jenny, what are you doing? Come back.
Sorry, can't stop. What are you gonna do? Tell my dad?
But where are you going? I've got the whole universe.
Planets to save, civilisations to rescue, creatures to defeat and an awful lot of running to do.
(CAR HONKING) Agatha Christie.
What about her?
That's me.
No!
Murder!
Chief Inspector Smith from Scotland Yard, known as the Doctor. Miss Noble is the plucky young girl that helps me out.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
(WHOOSHING) Oh, smell that air.
Grass and lemonade and a little bit of mint.
Just a hint of mint, it must be the 1920's.
You can tell what year it is, just by smelling?
Oh, yeah.
Or maybe that big vintage car, coming up the drive, gave it away.
(HONKING) The professor's luggage, Richard, step lively.
Good afternoon, Professor Peach.
Hello, Greeves, old man.
(CYCLE BELL RINGING) Ah, Reverend.
Professor Peach. Beautiful day.
Lord's in his heaven, all's right with the world.
Reverend Golightly.
Lady Eddison requests that you make yourselves comfortable in your rooms.
Cocktails will be served on the lawn from half past four.
You go on up. I need to check something in the library.
Oh?
Alone.
It's supposed to be a party. All this work'll be the death of you.
Never mind planet Zog! A party in the 1920's, that's more like it.
Trouble is, we haven't been invited.
Oh, I forgot. Yes, we have.
(SOFTLY) I was right.
Kept secret all these years. It's unbelievable.
But why didn't they ask... Heavens.
(BUZZING) Oh, it's you. I was just doing a little research.
I say, what are you doing with that lead piping?
(BUZZING) That's impossible.
No! No!
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) We'll be late for cocktails, What do you think, flapper or slapper?
Flapper. You look lovely.
Look sharp. We have quests.
Good afternoon.
Drinks, sir, ma'am?
A sidecar, please.
And a lime soda. Thank you.
May I announce Lady Clemency Eddison.
Lady Eddison.
Forgive me, but who exactly might you be?
And what are you doing here?
I'm the Doctor and this is Miss Donna Noble, of the Chiswick Nobles.
Good afternoon, my lady. Topping day, what? Spiffing. Top hole.
No, no, no, no, no. No, don't do that. Don't.
We were thrilled to receive your invitation, milady.
We met at the Ambassador's reception.
Doctor, how could I forget you?
But one must be sure with the Unicorn on the loose, A unicorn? Brilliant. Where?
The Unicorn. A jewel thief and nobody knows who he is.
He's just struck again.
Snatched Lady Babington’s pearls right from under her nose.
Funny place to wear pearls.
May I announce the Colonel Hugh Curbishley, the Honourable Roger Curbishley.
(GIGGLING) My husband and my son.
Forgive me for not rising.
Never been the same ever since that ‘flu epidemic back in ‘18.
My word. You are a super lady.
Oh, I like the colour of your jib. Chin-chin.
Hello, I'm the Doctor.
How do you do?
Very well.
Your usual, sir?
Thank you, Davenport. Just how I like it.
How come she's an Eddison, but her husband and son are Curbishleys?
The Eddison title descends through her. One day, Roger will be a Lord.
Robina Redmond.
She's the absolute hit of the social scene, a must.
Miss Redmond.
Spiffing to meet you at last, milady.
Reverend Arnold Golightly.
Ah, Reverend. How are you?
I heard about the church last Thursday night.
Those ruffians breaking in.
You apprehended them, I hear.
As the Christian fathers taught me, we must forgive them their trespasses, quite literally.
Some of these young boys deserve a decent thrashing.
Couldn't agree more, sir.
(CLEARS THROAT) (SOFTLY) Typical. All the decent men are on the other bus.
Or Time Lords.
REVEREND: Now, milady, what about the special guest you promised us?
Here she is. A lady who needs no introduction.
No, no, please don't.
Thank you, Lady Eddison, but, honestly, there is no need.
Agatha Christie.
What about her?
“That's me.
No. You're kidding.
Agatha Christie. I was just talking about you the other day.
I said, "I bet she's brilliant". I'm the Doctor, this is Donna.
Oh! I love your stuff. What a mind.
You fool me every time. Well, almost every time.
Well, once or twice. Well, once. But it was a good once.
You make a rather unusual couple.
Oh, no, we're not married.
No, we're not a couple.
Well, obviously not. No wedding ring.
Oh. You don't miss a trick.
And I'd stay that way, if I were you.
The thrill is in the chase, never in the capture.
Mrs Christie, I'm so glad you could come.
I'm one of your greatest followers. I've read all six of your books.
Is Mr Christie not joining us?
Is he needed?
Can't a woman make her own way in the world?
Don't give my wife ideas.
Now, Mrs Christie, I have a question.
Why a Belgian detective?
Excuse me, Colonel.
Belgians make such lovely buns.
(LAUGHING) Say, where on Earth's Professor Peach? He'd love to meet Mrs Christie, He said he was going to the library.
Miss Chandrakala, would you go and collect the Professor?
At once, milady.
The date on this newspaper...
What about it?
It's the day Agatha Christie disappeared.
Professor Peach?
Professor?
She just discovered her husband was having an affair.
DONNA: You'd never think to look at her, smiling away.
Well. She's British, moneyed. That's what they do. They carry on.
Except for this one time.
No one knows exactly what happened, she just vanished.
Her car will be found tomorrow morning, by the side of a lake.
Ten days later, Agatha Christie turns up at a hotel in Harrogate.
And she'd lost her memory.
She never spoke about the disappearance till the day she died.
~But whatever it was...
It's about to happen.
Right here, right now.
Professor! The library! Murder! Murder!
(GASPS) Goodness.
Bashed on the head. Blunt instrument.
Watch broke as he fell. Time of death was quarter past four.
A bit of pipe.
Call me Hercule Poirot, but I reckon that's blunt enough.
Nothing worth killing for in that lot. Dry as dust.
Doctor, the body in the library.
I mean, Professor Peach, in the library, with a lead piping.
EDDISON: Let me see. HUGH: Out of my way.
Gerald.
(ALL GASP) Someone should call the police.
DOCTOR: You don't have to.
Chief Inspector Smith, from Scotland Yard, known as the Doctor.
Miss Noble is the plucky young girl who helps me out.
I say.
Mrs Christie was right.
Go into the sitting room. I will question each of you in turn.
Come along, do as the Doctor says. Keep the room undisturbed.
"The plucky young girl who helps me out?” No policewomen in 1926.
I'll pluck you in a minute. Why don't we phone the real police?
Oh, the last thing we want is PC Plod sticking his nose in.
Especially, now I've found this.
Morphic residue.
Morphic? Doesn't sound very 1926.
It has left behind a return species’ genetic immune code.
The murderer's an alien.
Which means one of that lot is a alien in human form.
Yeah, but think about it.
There's a murder, a mystery and Agatha Christie.
(SNIFFS) So? Happens to me all the time.
No. But isn't that a bit weird?
Agatha Christie didn't go around surrounded by murders, not really.
I mean, that's like meeting Charles Dickens and he's surrounded by ghosts at Christmas.
“Well...
Oh, come on.
It's not like we could drive across country and find Enid Blyton having tea with Noddy.
Could we? Noddy’s not real. Is he? Tell me there's no Noddy.
There's no Noddy.
Next thing you know, you'll be telling me it's like Murder on the Orient Express, and they all did it.
Murder on the Orient Express?
Oh, yeah, one of the best.
But not yet.
Marvellous idea, though.
Yeah.
Tell you what, copyright, Donna Noble. Okay?
Anyway, Agatha and I will question the suspects.
Donna, you search the bedrooms, look for clues, (WHISPERING) Any more residues. You'll need this.
Is that for real.
Go on, you're ever so plucky.
Right, then, solving a murder mystery with Agatha Christie. Brilliant.
How like a man to have fun while there is disaster all around him.
~Sorry, yeah. I'll work with you, gladly.
But for the sake of justice, not your own amusement.
Now, then, Reverend, where were you at a quarter past four?
Let me think.
Why, yes, I remember.
I was unpacking in my room.
DOCTOR: No alibi, then? AGATHA: You were alone?
With the Lord one is never truly alone.
Doctor?
And where were you?
Let me think, I was...
Oh, yes, I was taking a constitutional in the fields behind the house.
Just taking a stroll, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alone?
Oh, yes. All alone, totally alone.
Absolutely alone. Completely. All of the time.
I wandered lonely as the proverbial cloud.
There was no one else with me. Not at all. Not ever, And, where were you?
At a quarter past four?
Well, I went to the toilet when I arrived, and then...
Oh, yes, I remember. I was preparing myself.
Positively buzzing with excitement about the party and the super fun of meeting Lady Eddie.
DOCTOR: We've only got your word for it.
That's your problem, not mine.
And, where were you, sir?
Quarter past four? Dear me! Let me think.
Ah, yes, remember.
I was in me study, reading through some military memoirs.
Fascinating stuff.
Took me back to me days in the army. Started reminiscing.
Mafeking... Terrible war.
DOCTOR: Colonel, snap out of it.
I was in me study.
No, no, no, right out of it.
Oh, sorry. Got a bit carried away there.
And where were you at a quarter past four, milady?
Now, let me see.
Yes, I remember. I was sitting in the blue room, taking my afternoon tea. It's a ritual of mine.
I needed to gather strength for the duty of hostess.
I then proceeded to the lawn, where I met you, Doctor, and I said, "And who exactly might you be and what were you doing here?" And you said, "I am the Doctor and this is Miss Donna Noble...” Yes, yes, you can stop now. I was there for that bit.
Of course.
(BURPS) Excuse me.
No alibis for any of them.
Secret adversary remains hidden.
We must look for a motive. Use the little, grey cells.
Oh, yes. Little, grey cells. Good ol’ Poirot.
You know, I've been to Belgium, yeah.
I remember.
I was deep in the Ardennes, trying to find Charlemagne.
He'd been kidnapped by an insane computer.
AGATHA: Doctor! Doctor!
Sorry.
Charlemagne lived centuries ago.
I've got a very good memory.
For such an experience, Detective, you missed a big clue.
What, that bit of paper you nicked out of the fire?
You were looking the other way.
Yeah, but I saw you reflected in the glass of the bookcase.
You crafty man.
This is all that was left.
DOCTOR: What's that first letter, "N" or "Mi"?
AGATHA: It's an "M". The word is "maiden".
Maiden! What does that mean?
(SIGHS) We're still no further forward.
Our nemesis remains at large. Unless Miss Noble's found something.
You won't find anything.
How come it's locked?
Lady Eddison commands it to be so.
And I command it to be otherwise. Scotland Yard. Pip, pip.
Why was it locked in the first place?
Many years ago, when my father was butler to the family, Lady Eddison returned from India with malaria.
She locked herself in this room for six months until she recovered.
Since then, the room has remained undisturbed.
There's nothing in here.
How long has it been empty?
Forty years.
Why did she seal it off?
All right, I need to investigate. You just buttle off.
(INSECT BUZZING) 1926, they've still got bees.
Oh, what noise. All right, busy bee, I'll let you out. Hold on.
I shall find you with my amazing powers of detection.
(GASPS) (SCREAMING) It's impossible.
Doctor!
(SCREECHING) Doctor!
(WOOD SHATTERING) There is a giant wasp.
What do you mean a giant wasp?
I mean, a wasp that's giant.
It's only a silly, little insect.
When I say giant, I don't mean big.
I mean flipping enormous! Look at its sting.
Let me see.
It's gone. Buzzed off.
But that's fascinating.
Don't, don't... Don't touch it, don't touch it. Let me.
A giant wasp?
Well, tons of amorphous, insectivorous life forms, but none in this galactic vector.
I think I understood some of those words.
Enough to know that you're completely potty.
Lost its sting. Now, that makes it defenceless.
A creature this size got to be able to grow a new one.
Uh, can we return to sanity? There are no such things as giant wasps.
Exactly, so... Question is, what's it doing here?
A murder? That's put the cat among the pigeons and no mistake.
It is not the stuff of gossip, Mrs Hart. Continue with your work.
But, who'd want to do in the old Professor?
He was always asking questions about that book of his.
What was all that about?
A dead man’s folly, nothing more.
Perhaps, if he asked about...
I must go and see milady.
(SCREAMING) (THUDDING) The poor, little child.
(WASP BUZZING) There!
Come on!
This makes a change. There's a monster and we're chasing it.
Every monster has a trick. They do it with mirrors.
Oh, my God, that’s holy.
Oh. Well, you are wonderful.
Now, just stop. Stop there.
(ALL GASP) i, fly boy.
DOCTOR: Don't let it get away! Quick, before it reverts back to human form!
Where are you? Come on. There's nowhere to run. Show yourself.
Oh.
That's just cheating.
My faithful companion. This is terrible.
Excuse me, milady. She was on her way to tell you something.
She never found me.
She had an appointment with death instead.
She said, “The poor, little child”. Does that mean anything to anyone?
No children in this house for years. Highly unlikely there will be any.
(CLEARS THROAT) Mrs Christie, you must have twigged something.
You've written simply the best detective stories.
Tell us, what would Poirot do?
Heaven's sake, cards on the table, woman. You should be helping us.
But... I'm merely a writer.
But surely you can crack it.
These events are exactly like one your plots.
That's what I've been saying. Agatha, that's gotta mean something.
But what? I've no answers, none.
I'm sorry, all of you. I'm truly sorry, but I've failed.
If anyone can help us, then it's the Doctor, not me.
Do you know what I think?
Those books of yours, one day, they could turn them into films.
They could be talking pictures.
Talking pictures?
Pictures that talk. What do you mean?
Oh, blimey, I've done it again.
I appreciate you're trying to be kind, but you are right.
These murders are like my own creations. It's as though someone's mocking me.
And I've had enough scorn for one lifetime.
Yeah. The thing is, I had this bloke once.
I was engaged and I loved him. I really did.
Turns out, he was lying through his teeth.
But you know what? I moved on.
I was lucky. I found the Doctor. He's changed my life.
There's always someone else.
I see.
Is my marriage the stuff of gossip now?
No, I just... I'm sorry.
No matter, the stories are true. I found my husband with another woman.
A younger, prettier woman. Isn't it always the way?
Well, mine was with a giant spider, but, same difference.
You and the Doctor talk such wonderful nonsense, Agatha, people love your books. They really do.
They're gonna be reading them for years to come.
If only. Try as I might, it's hardly great literature.
That's beyond me. I'm afraid my books will be forgotten, like ephemera.
Hello, what's that?
Those flowerbeds were perfectly neat earlier.
Now some of the stalks are bent over.
There you go. Who'd ever notice that? You're brilliant, Oh! Someone came here tooled up.
This is the sort of stuff a thief would use.
The Unicorn, he's here, The Unicorn and the wasp.
Your drinks, ladies. Doctor.
Very good, Greeves.
How about the science stuff, what did you find?
Hmm. Vespiform sting.
Vespiforms have got hives in the Silfrax Galaxy.
Again, you talk like Edward Lear.
For some reason, this one’s behaving like a character in one of your books.
DONNA: Come on, Agatha, what would Miss Marple do?
She'd have overheard something vital by now, because the murderer thinks she's just a harmless old lady.
Clever idea.
Miss Marple, who writes those?
Copyright Donna Noble. Add it to the list.
Donna.
Okay, we could split the copyright.
No. Something's inhibiting my enzymes.
(GRUNTING) I've been poisoned.
What do we do? What do we do?
It runs. It's cyanide. Sparkling cyanide.
(GRUNTING) Ginger beer!
I beg you pardon?
I need ginger beer.
The gentleman has gone mad!
I'm an expert in poisons, Doctor. There's no cure.
It's fatal.
Not for me. I can stimulate the inhibited enzymes into reversal.
Protein. I need protein.
Walnuts?
Bring it.
Can't understand you. How many words?
One. One word, Shake! Milk! Shake! Milk! Milk! No, not milk!
Um, shake, shake, shake!
Cocktail shake! You want a Harvey Wallbanger!
Harvey Wallbanger?
Well, I don't know!
How is Harvey Wallbanger one word!
What do you need, Doctor? Salt!
I was miming salt. Salt, I need something salty!
What about this?
What is it?
Salt!
That's too salty.
Oh, that's too salty.
What about this?
Mmm...
What's that?
Anchovies.
What is it? What else?
Um, it's a song! "Mammy"?
I don't know! Camptown Races.
Camptown Races?
Alright, then. Towering Inferno!
It's a shock! Look, shock. I need a shock!
Alright, then, big shock, coming up.
(GAGGING) (GRUNTING) Detox! Oh!
I must do that more often. I mean the... the detox.
Doctor, you are impossible. Who are you?
Terrible day for all of us. The professor struck down.
Miss Chandrakala cruelly taken from us. And yet we still take dinner.
We are British, Doctor.
What else must we do?
DOCTOR: And then someone tried to poison me.
Any one of you had the chance to put cyanide in my drink.
But it rather gave me an idea.
And what would that be?
Well, poison.
Drink up.
(CHOKES) I've laced the soup with pepper.
Mmm. I thought it was jolly spicy.
But the active ingredient of pepper is piperine.
Traditionally used as an insecticide.
Oh! Anyone got the shivers?
(GASPS) What the deuce...
Listen, listen, listen.
(WASP BUZZING) No, it can't be.
(GASPING) Show yourself, demon.
DOCTOR: Nobody move.
Oh, no. Stay where you are!
Out, out, out, out, now!
I'll cover you, Agatha. You've got a long, long life to lead yet.
Well, we know the butler didn't do it.
Then, who did?
My jewellery! The Firestone! It's gone! Stolen!
Roger.
(SCREAMING) My son... My child!
That poor footman!
Roger is dead and he can't even mourn him.
1926, it's more like the Dark Ages.
Did you inquire after the necklace?
Lady Eddison brought it back from India. It's worth thousands.
DOCTOR: This thing can sting, it can fly.
It could wipe us all out in seconds. Why is playing this game?
Every murder is essentially the same.
They're committed because somebody wants something.
What does a Vespiform want?
Doctor, stop it.
The murderer is as human as you or I.
You're right.
Oh, I've been so caught up with giant wasps, I'd forgotten you're the expert.
I'm not, I've told you. I'm just a purveyor of nonsense.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
‘Cause plenty of people write detective stories, but yours are the best.
Why? Why are you so good, Agatha Christie?
Because you understand. You've lived.
You've fought, you've had your heart broken.
You know about people.
Their passions, their hope and despair and anger, all of those tiny, huge things that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer.
Just think, Agatha. If anyone can solve this, it's you.
I've called you here, on this endless night, because we have a murderer in our midst.
And when it comes to detection, there's none finer.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Agatha Christie.
This is a crooked house. A house of secrets.
To understand the solution, we must examine them all.
Starting with you, Miss Redmond.
But I'm innocent, surely.
You've never met these people.
And these people have never met you.
I think the real Robina Redmond never left London. You're impersonating her.
How silly. What proof do you have?
You said you'd been to the toilet...
Oh, I know this. If she was really posh she'd say loo.
Earlier today, Miss Noble and I found this on the lawn, right beneath your bathroom window.
You must've heard that Miss Noble was searching the bedroom, so you panicked.
You ran upstairs and disposed of the evidence.
I've never seen that thing before in my life.
What's inside it?
The tools of your trade, Miss Redmond.
Or should I say... the Unicorn?
(GASPING) You came to this house with one sole intention, to steal the Firestone, Oh, all right, then. It's a fair cop...
Yes, I'm the bleeding Unicorn. Ever so nice to meet you, I don’t think.
I took my chance in the dark and nabbed it.
Go on, then, you nobs.
Arrest me. Sling me in jail.
So, is she the murderer?
Don't be so thick.
I might be a thief, but I ain't no killer.
Quite. There are darker motives at work and in examining this household, we come to you, Colonel.
Damn it, woman. You with your perspicacity.
You've rumbled me.
(GASPS) You can walk!
But why?
My darling, how else could I be certain of keeping you by my side?
I don't understand.
You're still a beautiful woman, Clemency.
Sooner or later, some chap will turn your head.
I couldn't bear that.
Staying in the chair was the only way I could be certain of keeping you.
Confounded Mrs Christie! How did you discover the truth?
Um, actually I had no idea.
I was just going to say you were completely innocent.
Oh! Sorry.
Uh, shall I sit down, then?
I think you better had.
So, he's not the murderer?
Indeed not.
To find the truth, let's return to this.
Far more than the Unicorn's object of desire.
The Firestone has quite a history.
Lady Eddison... I've done nothing.
You brought it back from India, did you not?
Before you met the Colonel.
You came home with malaria and confined yourself to this house for six months in a room that has been kept locked ever since.
Which I rather think means...
Stop, please.
I'm so sorry, but you had fallen pregnant in India.
Unmarried and ashamed, you hurried back to England with your confidante, a young maid, later to become housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala.
Clemency, is this true?
My poor baby. I had to give him away. The shame of it.
HUGH: But you've never said a word.
EDDISON: I had no choice. Imagine the scandal.
The family name. I'm British, I carry on.
And it was no ordinary pregnancy.
How can you know that?
Excuse me, Agatha, this is my territory.
But when you heard that buzzing sound in the dining room, you said, “It can't be".
Why did you say that?
You'd never believe it.
The Doctor has opened my mind to believe many things.
It was 40 years ago, in the heat of Delhi late one night.
I was alone and that's when I saw it: a dazzling light in the sky.
The next day he came to the house.
Christopher, the most handsome man I'd ever seen.
Our love blazed like a wildfire.
I held nothing back.
And in return, he showed me an incredible truth about himself.
He'd made himself human to learn about us.
This was his true shape.
I loved him so much, it didn't matter. But he was stolen from me.
1885, the year of the great monsoon, the river Jamuna rose up and broke its banks, He was taken with the flood.
But Christopher left me a parting gift a jewel like no other.
I wore it always, part of me never forgot.
I kept it close...
Always.
Just like a man.
Flashes his family jewels and you end up with a bun in the oven.
AGATHA: A poor little child.
Forty years ago, Miss Chandrakala took that newborn baby to an orphanage.
But Professor Peach worked it out. He found the birth certificate.
Oh, that's maiden. Maiden name.
AGATHA: Precisely.
So, she killed him.
I did not!
Miss Chandrakala feared that the Professor had unearthed your secret.
She was coming to warn you.
So, she killed her.
I did not!
Lady Eddison is innocent.
Because at this point...
Doctor.
Thank you! At this point, when we consider the lies and the secrets that are key to these events, then we have to consider it was you, Donna Noble.
What? What did I kill?
No, but you said it all along, the vital clue, that this whole thing is being acted out like a murder mystery.
Which means, it was you, Agatha Christie.
I beg your pardon, sir?
So, she killed them?
No, but she wrote.
She wrote those brilliant, clever books and who is her greatest admirer?
The moving finger points at you...
Lady Eddison.
Oh, leave me alone.
So, she did kill them.
No.
But just think. Last Thursday night, what were you doing?
Uh, I was, uh, I was in the library.
I was reading my favourite Agatha Christie, thinking about her plots and how clever she must be.
How is that relevant?
Just think.
What else happened on Thursday night?
I'm sorry?
You said on the lawn this afternoon.
Last Thursday night, those boys broke into your church.
That's correct. They did.
I discovered the two of them. Thieves in the night.
I was most perturbed.
What the blazes are you doing, boys?
(LAUGHING) But I apprehended them.
Really? A man of God against two strong lads?
A man in his 40's? Or should I say, 40 years old?
Exactly.
Oh, my God!
Lady Eddison, your child, how old would he be now?
Forty! He's 40.
Your child has come home.
This is poppycock.
DOCTOR: Oh?
You said you were taught by the Christian fathers, meaning, raised in an orphanage.
My son! Can it be?
You found those thieves, Reverend, and you got angry.
A proper, deep anger for the first time in your life and it broke the genetic lock.
You changed.
(BUZZING) Put those things back where you found them.
It's...
You realised your inheritance after all these years.
You knew who you were.
Oh! And then it all kicks off. ‘Cause this isn’t just a jewel.
It's a Vespiform telepathic recorder. It's part of you, your brain.
Your very essence.
And when you activated, so did the Firestone.
It beamed your full identity directly into your mind.
And at the same time, it absorbed the works of Agatha Christie directly from Lady Eddison.
It all became part of you.
The mechanics of those novels re-templated in your brain.
You killed in this pattern, because that's what you think the world is.
Turns out we are in the middle of a murder mystery.
One of yours, Dame Agatha.
Dame?
Oh! It's all right, not yet.
So he killed them? Yes? Definitely? “Yes.
Well...
This has certainly been a most entertaining evening.
Really, you can't believe any of this, surely, Lady Eddison?
(BUZZES) Lady who?
(BUZZING) Lady Eddison...
Little bit of buzzing there, Vicar.
Don't make me angry!
Why? What happens then?
(BUZZING) Damn it! You humans worshipping your tribal sky gods...
I am so much more.
That night, the universe exploded in my mind.
(BUZZING) I wanted to take what was mine!
And you, Agatha Christie, with your railway station bookstall romances...
What's to stop me killing you?
Oh, my dear God. My child!
What's to stop me killing you all?
(BUZZING) It's me...
No, no. Clemency, come back...
Keep away. Keep away, my God!
No! No! No more murder.
If my imagination made you kill, then my imagination will find a way to stop you, foul creature.
(SCREAMING) Run! He's chasing us.
(HONKING) AGATHA: Come here! Come and get me, Reverend!
Agatha, what are you doing?
If I started this, Doctor, then I must stop it.
Come on!
It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's all my fault.
You said this is the night Agatha Christie loses her memory?
Time is in flux, Donna.
For all we know, this is the night Agatha Christie loses her life and history gets changed.
But where is she going?
(WASP SCREECHING) The lake! She's heading for the lake. What's she doing?
Here I am, the honey in the trap.
Come to me, Vespiform. She's controlling him!
His mind is based on her thought processes. They're linked!
Quite so, Doctor. If I die, then this creature might die with me.
Don't hurt her!
You're not meant to be like this. You've got the wrong template your mind.
DONNA: He's not listening.
How do you kill a wasp?
Drown him, just like his father.

MAN: Close your eyes and tell me what you see, The library.
Open your eyes again.
Where are you now?
My living room, Dr Moon.
When you close your eyes?
I go to the library.
Go to the library now.
DR MOON: Are you back there?
Yes.
The same part?
GIRL: No, it’s always different. The library goes on forever.
How do you move around?
By wishing.
(DOOR RATTLING) What's wrong?
Something's here.
Someone's got in. No one’s supposed to get in.
She's never mentioned anyone else. She's always been alone.
Someone's in my library.
No, no, please! That's not allowed! It's not allowed!
Listen to me.
The library is in your mind.
I know it's in my mind. But something's got inside.
Oh, hello! Sorry to burst in on you like this.
Okay if we stop here for a bit?
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Books! People never really stop loving books.
51st century.
By now you've got holovids, direct-to-brain downloads, fiction-mist.
But you need the smell. The smell of books, Donna. Deep breath.
The library.
So big it doesn't need a name, just a great, big "the".
It's like a city.
It's a world, literally, a world.
The whole core of the planet is the index computer, biggest hard drive ever. And up here, every book ever written.
Whole continents of Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones, Monty Python's Big Red Book.
Brand-new editions, especially printed.
We're near the equator, so...
This must be biographies! I love biographies.
Yeah, very you. Always a death at the end.
You need a good death. Without death there'd only be comedies.
Dying gives us size.
Hey! Spoilers.
What?
These books are from your future.
You don't wanna read ahead, spoil all the surprises.
It's like peeking at the end.
Isn't travelling with you one big spoiler?
I try to keep you away from major plot developments.
Which, to be honest, I seem to be very bad at “cause, you know what, this is the biggest library in the universe.
So where is everyone?
It's silent.
The library?
The planet.
The whole planet.
Maybe it's a Sunday.
No, I never land on Sundays. Sundays are boring.
Oh, maybe everyone's really, really quiet.
Yeah, maybe.
But they'd still show up on the system.
Doctor, why are we here? Really, why?
Oh, you know, just passing.
No, seriously. It was all, “Let's hit the beach,” then suddenly we're in a library. Why?
Now that's interesting.
What?
Scanning for life forms. If I do a scan looking for your basic humanoids, you know, your book-readers, few limbs and a face, apart from us, I get nothing.
Zippo, nada. See, nobody home.
But if I widen the parameters to any kind of life...
A million million. Gives up after that.
A million million.
DONNA: But there's nothing here. There's no one.
And not a sound.
A million million life forms and silence in the library.
But there's no one here.
There's just books. I mean, it's not the books, is it?
I mean, it can't be the books, can it?
I mean, books can't be alive.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Welcome!
That came from here?
Yeah.
Tam Courtesy Node 710/Aqua. Please enjoy the library and respect the personal access codes of all your fellow readers, regardless of species or hygiene taboo.

No, but really, it's fine.

This message carries a Felman Lux Coherency Warning of...
Yeah, yeah. Fine, fine, fine! Just play it.
Message follows.
Count the shadows.
For God's sake remember, if you want to live, count the shadows.
Message ends, Donna.
Yeah.
Stay out of the shadows.
Why, what's in the shadows?
So, we weren't just in the neighbourhood.
Yeah, I kind of, sort of, lied a bit.
I got a message on the psychic paper.
What do you think? Cry for help?
Cry for help with a kiss?
We've all done that.
Who's it from?
No idea.
So why did we come here? Why did you...
Donna.
(BEEPING) What's happening?
Run!
Come on!
What, is it locked?
Jammed! The wood's warped.
Sonic it! Use the thingy!
I can't, it's wood.
What, it doesn't do wood?
Hang on, hang on.
I can vibrate the molecules, fry the bindings, I can shatterline the...
Oh, get out of the way!
Oh, hello! Sorry to burst in on you like this.
Okay if we stop here for a bit?
What is it?
A security camera.
Switched itself off.
They were in my library. How can they be in my library?
Who were they?
(SONIC SCREWDRIVER BUZZING) What's that? What's that noise?
What noise?
Nice door skills, Donna.
Yeah, well, you know, boyfriends.
Sometimes you need the element of surprise.
What was that? What was after us?
I mean, did we just run away from a power cut?
Possibly.
Are we safe here?
Of course we're safe. There's a little shop.
Gotcha!
(SOBBING) No, stop it! No! No!
Ooh, I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's alive, You said it was a security camera.
It is. It's an alive one, DR MOON: Can you hear me?
Are you all right?
Others are coming.
Who's coming? Who are the others?
The library is breached. Others are coming.
What others?
DONNA: "Others"? What's it mean, others?
Excuse me. What does it mean, others?
That's barely more than a speak your weight machine. It can't help you.
So why's it got a face?
This flesh aspect was donated by Mark Chambers on the occasion of his death.
It's a real face.
It has been actualised individually for you from the many facial aspects saved to our extensive flesh banks.
Please enjoy.
It chose me a dead face it thought I'd like?
That statue's got a real dead person's face on it!
It's the 51st century. That's basically like donating a park bench.
It's donating a face!
No! Wait! No!
Hands!
Shadow, look.
What about it?
DOCTOR: Count the shadows, One, there. I've counted it, one shadow.
Yeah.
But what's casting it?
Oh! I'm thick! Look at me! I'm old and thick!
Head's too full of stuff! I need a bigger head!
DONNA: Power must be going.
This place runs on fission cells. They'll out-burn the sun.
Then why is it dark?
It's not dark.
That shadow, it's gone.
We need to get back to the Tardis.
Why?
Because that shadow hasn't gone, it's moved.
Reminder. The library has been breached. Others are coming.

Reminder. The library has been breached. Others are coming.
Hello, sweetie.
Get out.
Doctor...
All of you, turn around, get back in your rocket and fly away.
Tell your grandchildren you came to the library and lived.
They won't believe you.
Pop your helmets, everyone, we got breathers.
How do you know they're not androids?
‘Cause I've dated androids. They're rubbish.
Who is this?
You said we were the only expedition. I paid for exclusives.
I lied. I’m always lying. Bound to be others.
Miss Evangelista, I want to see the contracts, You came through the north door? How was that? Much damage?
Please just leave. I'm asking you seriously and properly.
Just... Hang on. Did you say expedition?
My expedition. I funded it.
Oh, you're not, are you? Tell me you're not archaeologists.
Got a problem with archaeologists?
I'm a time traveller. I point and laugh at archaeologists.
Ah. Professor River Song.
Archaeologist.
River Song. Lovely name.
As you're leaving, and you're leaving now, you need to set up a quarantine beacon, code-wall the planet.
The whole planet! Nobody comes here, not ever again!
Not one living thing, not here, not ever!
Stop right there! What's your name?
Anita.
Anita, stay out of the shadows. Not a foot, not a finger in the shadows till you're safely back in your ship. Goes for all of you, stay in the light!
Find a nice bright spot and just stand.
If you understand me, look very, very scared.
No, a bit more scared than that.
Okay, do for now. You, who are you?
Dave.
Okay, Dave...
Oh, well, Other Dave.
Because that's Proper Dave, the pilot. He was the first Dave. So when...
Other Dave, the way you came, does it look the same as before?
Yeah. Oh! It's a bit darker.
How much darker?
Like, I could see where we came through just a moment ago. I can't now.
Seal up this door. We'll find another way out.
Would you...
We're not looking for a way out.
Miss Evangelista.
I'm Mr Lux's personal everything. You need to sign these contracts agreeing that your individual experience inside the library are the intellectual property of the Felman Lux Corporation.
Right. Give it here.
Yeah, lovely. Thanks.
My family built this library. I have rights.
You have a mouth that won't stop. You think there's danger here?
Something came to this library and killed everything in it.
Killed a whole world. Danger? Could be.
That was 100 years ago. The library's been silent for 100 years.
Whatever came here is long dead.
Bet your life?
Always.
LUX: What are you doing?
He said seal the door.
Torch.
You're taking orders from him?
Spooky, isn't it?
Almost every species in the universe has an irrational fear of the dark.
But they're wrong, ‘cause it's not irrational.
It's Vashta Nerada.
DONNA: What's Vashta Nerada?
It's what's in the dark.
It's what's always in the dark.
Lights! That's what we need! Lights! You got lights?
What for?
Form a circle, safe area, big as you can. Lights pointing out.
Why?
Do as he says.
You're not listening to this man?
Apparently I am.
Anita, un-pack the lights.
Other Dave, make sure the door's secure then help Anita.
Mr Lux, put your helmet back on and block the visor.
Proper Dave, find an active terminal, access the library database.
See what you can find out about what happened here 100 years ago.
Pretty boy, you're with me. Step into my office.
Professor Song, why am I the only one wearing my helmet?
I don't fancy you.
Probably I can help you.
Pretty boy, with me I said.
Oh, I , I'm pretty boy?
Yes! " Ooh, that came out a bit quick.
Pretty?
(EXCLAIMS) Don't let your shadows cross. Seriously, don't even let them touch.
Any of them could be infected.
How could a shadow be infected?
Excuse me. Can I help?
No, we're fine.
I could just, you know, hold things.
No, really, we're okay.
Okay.
Couldn't she help?
Trust me. I just spent four days on a ship with that woman. She's a...
Couldn't tell the difference between the escape pod and the bathroom.
We had to go back for her.
Twice, (CHATTERING) (DOCTOR CLEARS THROAT) Thanks.
For what?
The usual, for coming when I call.
Oh, that was you?
You're doing a very good job acting like you don't know me.
I'm assuming there's a reason.
A fairly good one, actually.
Okay, shall we do diaries, then? Where are we this time?
Ah, going by your face, I'd say it's early days for you.
Yeah, so, crash of the Byzantium, have we done that yet?
Obviously ringing no bells.
Alright, Oh... Picnic at Asgard. Have we done Asgard yet?
Obviously net. Blimey. Very early days, then.
Oh! Life of a time traveller, never knew it could be such hard work.
Um...
Look at you.
You're young.
I'm really not, you know.
Oh, but you are.
Your eyes. You're younger than I've ever seen you.
You've seen me before, then?
Doctor...
please tell me you know who I am.
Who are you?
(ALARM BUZZING) PROPER DAVE: Sorry, that was me.
Trying to get through into the security protocols, I seem to have set something off. What is that? Is that an alarm?
Doctor... Doctor that sounds like...
Yeah, it is. It's a phone.
(RINGING) Dad.
Ina minute.
I'm trying to call up the data core but it's not responding, just that noise.
But it's a phone.
Let me try something.
Dad, the phone. Aren't you going to answer it?
It's not ringing, sweetie.
Okay, it don't like that. Let's try something else.
DOCTOR ON TV: Okay, here it comes.
Hello.
Hello, Are you in my television?
Well, no, I'm...'m sort of in space.
Um, I was trying to call up the data core of a Triple-Grid Security Processor.
Would you like to speak to my dad?
Your dad or your mum, that would be lovely.
I know you. You were in my library.
Your library?
The library's never been on television before.
What have you done?
Ah, well, um, I just...
What happened? Who was that?
Keep working on those lights. I need those lights.
You heard him, people. Let there be light.
Sorry, you're not allowed to see inside the book.
It's against the rules.
What rules?
Your rules.
(CHATTERING ON TELEVISION) What's that?
I didn't do that. Did you do that?
Not me.
What's CAL?
You all right?
What's that? What's happening?
I don't know.
Oh, thanks for, you know, offering to help with the lights.
They don't want me. They think I'm stupid ‘cause I'm pretty.
Of course they don't. Nobody thinks that.
No, they're right, though. I'm a moron really.
My dad said I had the 1Q of plankton and I was pleased.
(LAUGHING) See, that's funny.
No, I really was pleased.
Is that funny? “No. No.
What's causing that? Is it the little girl?
Who is the little girl? What's she gotta do with this place?
ON TV: No way. No swapsies. This eeny-weeny bit of metal is...
How does the data core work? What's the principle? What's CAL?
Ask Mr Lux.
CAL, what is it?
Sorry, you didn't sign your personal experience contracts.
Mr Lux, right now you're in more danger than you've ever been in your whole life.
And you're protecting a patent?
I'm protecting my family's pride.
Well, funny thing, Mr Lux.
I don't wanna see everyone in this room dead because some idiot thinks his pride is more important.
Then why don't you sign his contract?
I didn't either. I'm getting worse than you.
Okay. Okay, let's start at the beginning. What happened here?
On the actual day, 100 years ago, what physically happened?
MAN ON TV: See? How about this huge...
SONG: There was a message from the library, just one.
"The lights are going out.” Then the computer sealed the planet, and there was nothing for 100 years.
It's taken three generations of my family just to decode the seals and get back in.
Um, excuse me?
LUX: Not just now.
There was one other thing in the last message.
That's confidential.
I trust this man.
With my life, with everything.
You've only just met him.
No. He's only just met me.
Um, this might be important, actually.
In a moment.
This is a data extract that came with the message.
"4,022 saved. No survivors." 4,022, that's the exact number of people who were in the library when the planet was sealed.
How can 4,022 people have been saved if there were no survivors?
That's what we're here to find out.
And so far, what we haven't found are any bodies.
(DISTANT RUMBLING) (EVANGELISTA SCREAMS) Everybody, careful. Stay in the light.
You keep saying that, I don't see the point.
Who screamed?
Miss Evangelista.
Where is she?
Miss Evangelista, please state your current...
(ECHOING) Please state your current...
(ECHOING) . position.
It's her.
That's Miss Evangelista.
We heard her scream a few seconds ago.
What could do that to a person in a few seconds?
Took a lot less than a few seconds.
What did?
EVANGELISTA: Hello?
Uh, I'm sorry, everyone.
This isn't going to be pleasant.
She's ghosting.
She's what?
Hello, excuse me?
I'm sorry, hello, excuse me?
That's... That's her. That's Miss Evangelista.
I don't wanna sound horrible, but couldn't we just, you know...
This is her last moment, no, we can't. A little respect, thank you.
Sorry, where am I? Excuse me?
But that's Miss Evangelista.
It's a data ghost.
She'll be gone in a moment.
(ECHOING) Miss Evangelista, you're fine. Just relax.
We'll be with you presently.
What's a data ghost?
There's a neural relay in the communicator, lets you send thought-mails.
That's it there. Those green lights.
Sometimes it can hold an impression of a living consciousness for a short time after death.
Like an after image.
Her grandfather lasted a day.
Kept talking about his shoelaces.
She's in there, I can't see, I can't... where am I?
She's just brainwaves now. Pattern won't hold for long.
She's conscious.
She's thinking.
I can't see. I can't...
I don't know what I'm thinking.
She's a footprint on the beach.
And the tide's coming in.
Where is that woman?
The nice woman, is she there?
What woman?
She means...
I think she means me.
Is she there? The nice woman?
Yes, she's here. Hang on.
Go ahead, she can hear you.
Hello, are you there?
Help her.
~She's dead.
Yeah, help her.
Hello, is that the nice woman?
Yeah. Hello. Yeah, I'm... I'm here. You okay?
What I said before, about being stupid, don't tell the others, they'll only laugh.
Of course I won't. Course I won't tell them.
Don't tell the others, they'll only laugh.
I won't tell them. I said I won't.
Don't tell the others, they'll only laugh.
I'm not going to tell them.
Don't tell the others, they'll only laugh.
She's looping now. The pattern's degrading.
I can't think...
(SIGNAL FLUTTERING) I don’t know... I...
LL.
Ice cream, Ice cream.
Ice cream, Ice cream. Ice cream...
Does anybody mind if...
Ice cream...
Ice cream, Ice cream. Ice cream...
That was... That was horrible, That was the most horrible thing I've ever seen.
Well, it's just a freak of technology.
Whatever did this to her, whatever killed her, I'd like a word with that. I'll introduce you.
I'm gonna need a packed lunch.
Hang on.
What's in that book? Spoilers.
Who are you?
Professor River Song. University of...
To me.
Who are you to me?
Again.
Spoilers.
Chicken and a bit of salad, knock yourself out.
Right, you lot. Let's all meet the Vashta Nerada.
Darling, Dr Moon is going now, but he'd like a word with you alone.
Is that all right?
Yes, of course, Dr Moon.
Thank you.
Now, listen.
This is important.
There's the real world, and there's the world of nightmares.
That's right, isn't it? You understand that?
Yes, I know, Dr Moon.
What I want you to remember is this, and I know it's hard.
The real world is a lie, and your nightmares are real.
The library is real. There are people trapped in there.
People who need to be saved.
The shadows are moving again. Those people are depending on you.
Only you can save them. Only you.
You travel with him, don't you? The Doctor, you travel with him.
What of it?
Proper Dave, could you move over a bit?
Why?
Over there by the water cooler. Thanks.
DONNA: You know him, don't you? SONG: Oh, God, do I know that man!
We go way back, that man and me.
Just not this far back.
I'm sorry, what?
He hasn't met me yet.
I sent him a message, but it went wrong. It arrived too early.
This is the Doctor in the days before he knew me.
And he looks at me...
He looks right through me and it shouldn't kill me but it does.
What're you talking about? Are you just talking rubbish?
Do you know him, or don't you?
DOCTOR: Donna! Quiet, I'm working. “Sorry.
Donna, you're Donna? Donna Noble.
Yeah. Why?
I do know the Doctor. But in the future.
His personal future.
So, why don't you know me? Where am I in the future?
DOCTOR: Okay, got a live one.
That's not darkness down those tunnels, This is not a shadow.
It's a swarm. A man-eating swarm.
The piranhas of the air, the Vashta Nerada.
Literally, the shadows that melt the flesh.
Most planets have them, but usually in small clusters.
I've never seen an infestation on this scale, or this aggressive.
What do you mean, most planets? Not Earth?
Mmm. Earth, and a billion other worlds.
Where there's meat, there's Vashta Nerada.
You can see them sometimes, if you look.
The dust in sunbeams.
If they were on Earth, we'd know.
Nah. Normally they live on road-kill.
But sometimes people go missing.
Not everyone comes back out of the dark.
Every shadow?
No, but any shadow.
So, what do we do?
Daleks, aim for the eye-stalk. Sontarans, back of the neck.
Vashta Nerada...
run. Just run.
Run? Run where?
This is an index point, there must be an exit teleport somewhere.
Don't look at me, I haven't memorised the schematics.
Doctor, the little shop. They always make you go through the little shop on the way out so they can sell you stuff.
You're right. Brilliant! That's why I like the little shop.
Okay, let's move it.
Actually, Proper Dave...
Could you stay where you are for a moment?
Why?
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
But you've got two shadows.
It's how they hunt. They latch onto a food source and keep it fresh.
What do I do?
You stay absolutely still.
Like there's a wasp in the room. Like there's a million wasps.
We're not leaving you, Dave.
Of course we're not leaving you.
Where's your helmet? Don't point, just tell me.
On the floor, by my bag.
Don't cross his shadow!
Thanks. Now, the rest of you, helmets back on and sealed up. We'll need everything we've got.
DONNA: Doctor, we haven't got any helmets.
Yeah, but we're safe anyway.
How are we safe?
We're not. That was a clever lie to shut you up.
Professor, anything I can do with the suit?
What good are the damn suits?
Miss Evangelista was wearing a suit, there was nothing left.
We can increase the mesh density. Dial it up 400%.
Make it a tougher meal.
DOCTOR: Okay.
800%. Pass it on.
Gotcha.
What's that?
It's a screwdriver.
It's sonic.
Yeah, I know. Snap.
With me, come on.
What are we doing? We're shopping? Is it a good time to shop?
No talking, just moving. Try it. Right, stand out in the middle.
It's a teleport. Stand in the middle.
Can't send the others, Tardis won't recognise them.
What're you doing?
You don't have a suit, you're not safe.
You don't have a suit, so you're in as much danger as I am.
I'm not leaving...
Donna, let me explain!
Ah, that's how you do it.
SONG: Doctor.
(SCREAMING) Where did it go?
It's just gone, I looked around, one shadow, see?
Does that mean we can leave? I don't want to hang around here.
I don't know why we're still here. We can leave him, can't we?
I mean, no offence.
Shut up, Mr Lux.
Did you feel anything like an energy transfer? Anything at all?
No, no, but look. It's gone.
Stop there. Stop. Stop. Stop there. Stop moving.
They're never just gone and they never give up.
Mmm-mmm. This one’s benign.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
No one, they're fine.
No, seriously, turn them back on.
They are on.
I can't see a ruddy thing.
Dave, turn around.
What's going on?
Why can't I see? Is the power gone?
Are we safe here?
Dave, I want you to stay still.
Absolutely still.
Dave, Dave, Dave, can you hear me? Talk to me, Dave.
I'm fine. I'm okay, I'm fine.
I want you to stay still.
Absolutely still. I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm fine.
I can’t... Why can’t I? 1...
I can't... Why can’t I? I...
I can't... Why can’t I? I...
He's gone. He's ghosting.
I can't... Why can't I? 1...
Then why is he still standing?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Doctor, don't.
Dave, can you hear me?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Who turned out the lights?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Excuse me!
Back from it, get back, right back!
Doesn't move that fast, does it?
It's a swarm in a suit.
But it's learning.
What do we do? Where do we go?
See that wall behind you?
Duck.
Squareness gun!
Everybody out. Go, go, go. Move it. Move, move.
Move it. Move, move.
You said not every shadow.
But any shadow.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
SONG: Run.
Sweetie, dinner's ready.
Donna Noble has been saved.
Sweetie?
(DISTANT BUZZING) Trying to boost the power.
Light doesn't stop them, but it slows them down.
So, what's the plan? We have a plan?
Your screwdriver.
Looks exactly like mine.
Yeah.
You gave it to me.
I don't give my screwdriver to anyone.
I'm not anyone.
Who are you?
What's the plan?
I teleported Donna back to the Tardis.
If we don't get back there in under five hours, Emergency Programme One will activate.
Take her home, yeah. We need to get a shift on.
She's not there. I should've received a signal.
The console signals me if there's a teleport breach.
Maybe the coordinates have slipped. The equipment here's ancient.
Donna Noble. There's a Donna Noble somewhere in this library, do you have the software to locate her position?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
Donna...
Donna Noble has left the library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
How can it be Donna? How's that possible?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
Oh, Donna...
Donna Noble has...
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Doctor.
Donna Noble has been saved.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Doctor, we've got to go now!
Donna Noble has been saved.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Doctor, what're we gonna do?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
I trust that man to the end of the universe, And actually, we've been.
Who are you?
And then you forgot.
You just killed someone I like, that is not a safe place to stand.
This planet is gonna crack like an egg.
Daddy! No, Daddy!
I hate you sometimes.
I know.
Don't play games with me.
We need to stop this. We've gotta save CAL.
What is it? What is CAL?
Spoilers. Spoilers.
No, don't tell! You mustn't tell!  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
DOCTOR: The library. So big it doesn't need a name.
Someone's got in. Someone's in my library.
"4,022 saved. No survivors." Others are coming.
What others?
Professor River Song. Archaeologist.
You've seen me before, then?
The real world is a lie, and your nightmares are real.
What's CAL?
The library is real. There are people trapped in there.
People who need to be saved.
There's a neural relay in the communicator.
Sometimes it can hold an impression of a living consciousness for a short time after death.
The shadows are moving again. Only you can save them.
The piranhas of the air. The Vashta Nerada, (SCREAMING) Donna Noble has been saved.

Donna Noble has left the library. Donna Noble has been saved.

(DOCTOR WHO THEME) Hey, who turned out the lights?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
This way, quickly! Move!
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Dad, the library, it's on television now.
How many times, darling? The library is just your imagination.
Donna?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hello, Donna.
Who are you?
I'm Dr Moon.
I've been treating you since you came here two years ago.
Oh, God. Dr Moon, I'm so sorry.
What's wrong with me? I didn't know you for a moment.
And then you remembered.
Shall we go for a walk? No more dreams, then?
The Doctor, the blue box, time and space.
How did we get here?
We came down the stairs, out the front door.
We passed Mrs Ali on the way out.
Yeah. Yeah, we did.
I forgot that.
And then you remembered.
Shall we go down to the river?
You said "river" and suddenly we're feeding ducks.
Dr Moon.
Morning.
Donna Noble, Lee McAvoy.
Hello, Lee.
Hello.
Ooh, you've got a bit of a stammer there.
Bless.
(LEE STAMMERING) Oh, skip to a vowel, they're easy.
How did we leave it, him and me?
I got the impression he was inviting you fishing. Tomorrow.
So...
Fishing?
(THUNDER RUMBLING) (STAMMERING) Gorgeous, and can't speak a word.
What am I gonna do with you?
(STAMMERING) Welcome home, Mrs McAvoy.
(CHILDREN SQUEALING) Stop it. Stop it now. We've got a visitor.
You've done so much in seven years, Donna.
Sometimes it feels more like 70.
Mind you, sometimes it feels like no time at all.
Can I just say what a pleasure it is to see you fully integrated?
DOCTOR: The signal's definitely coming from the moon.
I'm blocking it, but it’s trying to break through. Donna!
Oops, sorry.
Mrs Angelo's rhubarb surprise.
Will I never learn?
The Doctor!
I saw the Doctor!
Yes, you did, Donna, and then you forget.
Dr Moon. Oh, hello.
Shall I make you a cup of tea?
(ELECTRONIC BUZZING) Okay, we got a clear spot. In, in, in!
Right in the centre, in the middle of the light. Quickly!
Don't let your shadows cross.
Doctor... I'm doing it.
There's no light here.
Sunset's coming. We can't stay long.
Have you found a live one?
Maybe, it's getting harder to tell. What's wrong with you?
We're going to need a chicken leg. Who's got a chicken leg?
Thanks, Dave.
Okay. Okay, we got a hot one. Watch your feet.
They won't attack until there's enough of them.
But they've got our scent now. They're coming.
River, who is he?
You haven't even told us. You just expect us to trust him.
He's the Doctor.
And who is "The Doctor"?
The only story you'll ever tell, if you survive him.
You say he's your friend, but he doesn't even know who you are.
Listen, all you need to know is this, I trust that man to the end of the universe, And actually, we've been.
He doesn't act like he trusts you.
Yeah. There's a tiny problem.
He hasn't met me yet.
What's wrong with it?
There's a signal coming from somewhere.
Interfering with it.
Well, use the red settings.
It doesn't have a red setting.
Well, use the dampers.
It doesn't have dampers.
It will do one day.
So, sometime in the future, I just give you my screwdriver?
Yeah.
Why would I do that?
I didn't pluck it from your cold, dead hands if that's what you're worried about.
And I know that because...?
Listen to me, you've lost your friend, you're angry, I understand.
But you need to be less emotional, Doctor, right now...
Less... I'm not emotional.
There are five people in this room still alive. Focus on that.
Dear God, you're hard work young.
Young? Who are you?
Oh, for heaven's sake! Look at the pair of you!
We're all going to die right here, and you're just squabbling like an old married couple.
Doctor, one day, I'm going to be someone that you trust.
Completely.
But I can't wait for you to find that out.
So I'm going to prove it to you.
And I'm sorry.
I'm really very sorry.
Are we good?
Doctor, are we good?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
Good.
Now, what's interesting about my screwdriver, very hard to interfere with. Practically nothing's strong enough.
Well, some hair dryers, but I'm working on that.
So, there is a very strong signal coming from somewhere, and it wasn't there before. So, what's new? What's changed?
Come on! What's new? What's different?
I don't know. Nothing.
It's getting dark.
It's a screwdriver. It works in the dark.
Moonlight.
Tell me about the moon. What's there?
It's not real. It was built as part of the library.
It's just a doctor moon.
What's a doctor moon?
A virus checker.
It supports and maintains the main computer at the core of the planet.
Well, it's still active. It's signalling, look.
Someone somewhere in this library is alive and communicating with the moon.
Or possibly alive and drying their hair.
No. Signal is definitely coming from the moon.
I'm blocking it, but it's trying to break through.
Doctor!
Donna!
Doctor, that was your friend.
Can you get her back? What was that?
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Trying to find the wavelength.
Being blocked!
Professor...
SONG: Just a moment.
It's important.
I have two shadows.
Helmets on, everyone. Anita, I'll get yours.
Didn't do Proper Dave any good.
Just keep it together, okay?
Keeping it together.
I'm only crying.
I'm about to die, it's not an overreaction.
Hang on.
Oh, God, they've got inside.
No, no. I just tinted her visor.
Maybe they'll think they're already in there, Leave her alone.
You think they could be fooled like that?
Maybe, I don't know. It's a swarm, it's not like we chat.
Can you still see, Anita?
Just about.
Just stay back.
Professor, quick word please.
What?
Down here.
What is it?
You said there are five people still alive in this room.
Yeah, so?
S0...
Why are there six?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Run!
Hey, who turned out the lights?
ON TV: Hey, who turned out the lights?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Here you are, Dr Moon.
Mummy, I made you!
Ooh. That's nice, Ella. Where's the face?
I don't know.
Did you see Dr Moon? Did he leave?
KIDS: Daddy!
Hey, hello, kids!
Come here, big hugs. Big Daddy hugs!
Look what I made.
Oh! It's Mummy.
It hasn't got a face.
Did you see Dr Moon?
No. Why, was he here?
Yeah, just a second ago. You must have passed him.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...
Just?
Nothing.
It's been a long day, that's all.
Just tired.
You okay?
I said I was tired and...
And we put the kids to bed, and we watched television.
(RATTLING) Is that a letter?
It's midnight.
Go see what it is.
LEE: The world is wrong.
What?
For you. Weird, though.
“Dear Donna, the world is wrong.
“Meet me at your usual play park, 2:00 tomorrow." Nutter, Don't go! Please don't go!
All right, you two, off you go. No fighting.
(CHILDREN GIGGLING) I got your note last night.
"The world is wrong.” What does that mean?
No, you didn't. I'm sorry, what?
You didn’t get my note last night.
You got it a few seconds ago.
Having decided to come, you suddenly found yourself arriving.
That is how time progresses here, in the manner of a dream.
You've suspected that before, haven't you, Donna Noble?
How do you know me?
We met before. In the library.
You were kind to me.
I hope now to return that kindness.
Your voice...
I recognise it.
Yes, you do.
I am what is left of Miss Evangelista.
Professor, go ahead. Find a safe spot.
It's a carnivorous swarm in a suit. You can't reason with it.
Five minutes.
Other Dave, stay with him. Pull him out when he’s too stupid to live.
Two minutes, Doctor.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
You hear that? Those words?
That is the very last thought of the man who wore that suit, before you climbed inside and stripped his flesh.
That's a man's soul trapped inside a neural relay, going round and round forever.
Now, if you don't have the decency to let him go, how about this?
Use him, talk to me.
It's easy. Neural relay. Just point and think. Use him, talk to me.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
The Vashta Nerada live on all the worlds in this system, but you hunt in forests. What are you doing in a library?
We should go. Doctor!
In a minute.
You came to a library to hunt. Why? Just tell me why.
We did not...
Oh, hello.
We did not...
Take it easy, you'll get the hang of it. Did not what?
We did not come here.
Well, of course you did. Of course you came here.
We come from here.
From here?
We hatched here.
You hatch from trees, from spores in trees.
These are our forests.
You're nowhere near a forest. Look around you.
These are our forests.
You're not in a forest. You're in a library.
There are no trees in a...
Library.
We should go. Doctor!
Books. You came in the books, Microspores in a million, million books.
We should go. Doctor!
Oh! Look at that!
The forest of the Vashta Nerada, pulped and printed and bound.
A million, million books hatching shadows.
We should go. Doctor!
Oh, Dave!
Oh, Dave, I'm so sorry!
Hey, who turned out the lights?
We should go. Doctor!
Thing about me, I'm stupid. I talk too much.
I was babbling on. This gob doesn't stop for anything.
Want to know the only reason I'm still alive?
Always stay near the door.
EVANGELISTA: I suggested we meet here because the playground’s the easiest place to see it.
To see the lie.
What lie?
The children. Look at the children, Why do you wear that veil?
If [had a face like yours, I wouldn't hide it.
You remember my face, then?
The memories are all still there.
The library, the Doctor, me.
You've just been programmed not to look.
Sorry, but you're dead.
In a way we're all dead here, Donna.
We are the dead of the library.
Well, what about the children? The children aren't dead.
My children aren't dead.
Your children were never alive.
Don't you say that.
Don't you dare say that about my children!
Look at your children.
Look at all of them, really look. They're not real.
Do you see it now? They're all the same.
All the children of this world, the same boy and the same girl, over and over again.
Stop it! Just stop it! Why are you doing this?
Why are you wearing that veil?
You know, it's funny, I keep wishing the Doctor was here.
ANITA: The Doctor is here, isn't he?
He's coming back, right?
You know when you see a photograph of someone you know, but it's from years before you knew them?
It's like they're not quite finished. They're not done yet.
Well, yes, the Doctor's here.
He came when I called, just like he always does.
But not my Doctor.
Now, my Doctor...
I've seen whole armies turn and run away, and he'd just swagger off back to his Tardis and open the doors with a snap of his fingers.
The Doctor, in the Tardis.
Next stop everywhere.
DOCTOR: Spoilers.
Nobody can open a Tardis by snapping their fingers.
Doesn't work like that.
It does for the Doctor.
I am the Doctor.
Yeah. Someday.
How you doing?
Where's Other Dave?
Not coming, sorry.
Well, if they've taken him, why haven't they gotten me yet?
I don't know.
Maybe tinting your visor's making a difference.
It's making a difference all right.
No one's ever going to see my face again.
Can I get you anything?
An old age would be nice.
Anything you can do? I'm all over it.
Doctor.
When we first met you, you didn't trust Professor Song.
And then she whispered a word in your ear, and you did.
My life so far, I could do with a word like that.
What did she say?
(ANITA CHUCKLES) Give a dead girl a break. Your secrets are safe with me.
Safe.
What?
Safe. You don't say “saved”. Nobody says "saved". You say “safe”.
The data fragment, what did it say?
4,022 people saved. No survivors.
Doctor?
Nobody says “saved”. Nutters say “saved”.
You say "safe", but it didn't mean safe, it meant...
It literally meant saved!
DONNA: What happened to your face? EVANGELISTA: Transcription errors.
Destroyed my face, did wonders for my intellect.
I'm a very poor copy of myself.
Where are we? Why are the children all the same?
It's the same pattern over and over. Saves an awful lot of space.
DONNA: Space?
EVANGELISTA: Cyberspace.
No, don't tell! You mustn't tell!
DOCTOR: See, there it is. Right there.
100 years ago, massive power surge. All the teleports going at once.
Soon as the Vashta Nerada hit their hatching cycle, they attack.
Someone hits the alarm. The computer tries to teleport everyone out.
It tried to teleport 4,022 people?
Succeeded, pulled them all out. But then what?
Nowhere to send them. Nowhere safe in the whole library.
Vashta Nerada growing in every shadow.
4,022 people all beamed up and nowhere to go.
They're stuck in the system, waiting to be sent, like emails.
So, what's a computer to do? What does a computer always do?
It saved them.
The library, a whole world of books.
Right at the core, the biggest hard drive in history.
The index to everything ever written, backup copies of every single book.
The computer saved 4,022 people the only way a computer can.
It saved them to the hard drive.
EVANGELISTA: Your physical self is stored in the library as an energy signature.
It can be actualised again whenever you or the library requires.
The library?
If my face ends up on one of those statues...
You remember the statues?
Wait. No. Just hang on. So...
This isn't the real me. This isn’t my real body.
I've been dieting!
What you see around you, this entire world, is nothing more than virtual reality.
So why do you look like that?
Thad no choice. You teleported, you're a perfect reproduction.
I was just a data-ghost caught in the Wi-Fi and automatically uploaded.
And it made you clever?
We're only strings of numbers in here.
I think a decimal point may have shifted in my IQ.
But my face has been the bigger advantage.
I have the two qualities you require to see absolute truth.
Tam brilliant, and unloved.
If this is all a dream, whose dream is it?
It's hard to see everything in the data core, even for me, but...
There is a word. Just one word.
CAL.
ELLA: Mummy, my knee!
Oh! Oh, look at that knee. Oh, look at that silly knee.
She's not real. They're fictions.
I'm sorry, but now that you understand that, you won't be able to keep a hold.
They are sustained only by your belief.
You don't know, you don't have children.
Neither do you.
Donna, for your own sake, let them go.
Stop it! You'll spoil everything! I hate you!
You're going to ruin everything! Stop it!
Sweetie, what's wrong?
Shut up!
Daddy! No, Daddy!
(ALARM BLARING) What is it? What's wrong?
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Auto destruct enabled in 20 minutes.
Mummy, what did the lady mean? Are we not real?
Where are we going?
Home.
That was quick, wasn't it, Mummy?
Mummy, what's wrong with the sky?
What's maximum erasure?
In 20 minutes, this planet's gonna crack like an egg.
No. No, it's all right. The doctor moon will stop it.
It's programmed to protect CAL.
Now, you really must stop this, you know.
You've forgotten again, it was you who saved all those people, haven't you?
And then you remembered.
Shut up, Dr Moon!
No, no, no, no, no!
ELECTRONIC VOICE: All library systems are permanently offline.
Sorry for any inconvenience...
We need to stop this. We gotta save CAL!
What is it? What is CAL?
We need to get to the main computer. I'll show you.
It's at the core of the planet?
Well then, let's go.
Gravity platform.
DOCTOR: I bet I like you.
Oh, you do.
Mummy, you're hurting my hand.
You just stay where I can see you.
You don't get out of my sight.
Is it bedtime?
Okay. That was lovely, wasn’t it?
That was a lovely bedtime.
We had warm milk, and we watched cartoons.
And then Mummy read you a lovely bedtime story.
Mummy, Joshua and me, we're not real, are we?
Of course you're real. You're as real as anything.
Why do you say that?
But, Mummy, sometimes when you're not here, it's like we're not here.
Even when you close your eyes, we just stop.
Well, Mummy promises to never close her eyes again.
No. No...
No, please! No, please!
(SCREAMING) No! No!
No!
No!
(SOBBING HYSTERICALLY) ELECTRONIC VOICE: Auto destruct in 15 minutes, The data core. Over 4,000 living minds trapped inside it.
Yeah, well, they won't be living much longer. We're running out of time.
Help me. Please help me. Please, please help me.
Help me. Please help me.
What's that? Was that a child?
The computer's in sleep mode.
I can't wake it up. I'm trying.
Doctor, these readings...
I know. You'd think it was...
Dreaming.
It is dreaming, of a normal life.
And a lovely dad, and of every book ever written.
ANITA: Computers don't dream.
Help me. Please help me.
No, but little girls do.
Please help me. Please help me.
Oh, my God.
It's the little girl.
The girl we saw in the computer.
LUX: She's not in the computer.
Ina way, she is the computer. The main command node.
This is CAL.
CAL is a child!
A child hooked up to a mainframe! Why didn't you tell me this?
I needed to know this!
Because she's family!
CAL.
Charlotte Abigail Lux.
My grandfather's youngest daughter.
She was dying, so we built her a library and put her living mind inside.
The moon to watch over her, and all of human history to pass the time.
Any era to live in. Any book to read.
She loved books more than anything.
And he gave her them all.
He asked only that she be left in peace. A secret.
Not a freak show.
So, you weren't protecting a patent. You were protecting her.
Hers was only half a life, of course.
But it's forever.
And then the shadows came.
The shadows. I have to... I have to save...
Have to save...
And she saved them.
She saved everyone in the library.
Folded them into her dreams and kept them safe.
ANITA: Then why didn't she tell us?
Because she’s forgotten.
She's got over 4,000 living minds chatting away inside her head.
It must be like being, well...
Me.
So what do we do?
Auto destruct in 10 minutes.
Easy.
Beam the people out of the data core.
The computer will reset, stop the countdown.
Difficult. Charlotte doesn't have enough memory space left to make the transfer.
Easy. I'll hook myself up to the computer.
She can borrow my memory space.
Difficult. It'll kill you stone dead.
Easy to criticise.
It'll burn out both your hearts. And don't think you'll regenerate!
I'll try my hardest not to die. Honestly, it's my main thing.
Doctor... I'm right, this'll work. Shut up.
Listen, you and Lux go back up to the main library.
Prime any data cells you can find for maximum download.
And before you say anything else, can I just mention in passing, as you're here, shut up!
I hate you sometimes!
I know.
Mr Lux, with me. Anita, if he dies, I'll kill him!
What about the Vashta Nerada?
These are their forests. I'm gonna seal Charlotte inside her little world, take everybody else away.
The shadows can swarm to their hearts' content.
So you think they're just gonna let us go?
Best offer they're gonna get.
You're gonna make them an offer?
They'd better take it.
‘Cause right now, I'm finding it very hard to make any kind of offer at all.
You know what? I really liked Anita.
She was brave, even when she was crying, and she never gave in, and you ate her.
But I'm gonna let that pass, just as long as you let them pass.
How long have you known?
I counted the shadows, You only have one now.
She's nearly gone. Be kind.
These are our forests. We are not kind.
I'm giving you back your forests, but you are giving me them.
You are letting them go.
These are our forests. They are our meat.
Don't play games with me.
You just killed someone | liked. That is not a safe place to stand.
I'm the Doctor, and you're in the biggest library in the universe.
Look me up.
You have one day.
Anita!
I'm sorry, she's been dead a while now. I told you to go.
Lux can manage without me.
But you can't.
Auto destruct in two minutes.
Oh, no. Come on, what are you doing? That's my job.
Oh, and I'm not allowed to have a career, I suppose?
Why are my hands... Why do you even have handcuffs?
Spoilers.
This is not a joke. Stop this now. This is gonna kill you.
I'd have a chance. You don't have any.
You wouldn't have a chance and neither do I.
I'm timing it for the end of the countdown.
There will be a blip in the command flow.
That way, it should improve our chances of a clean download.
River, please, no.
Funny thing is, this means you've always known how I was going to die.
All the time we've been together, you knew I was coming here.
The last time I saw you, the real you, the future you, I mean...
You turned up on my doorstep with a new haircut and a suit.
You took me to Darillium to see the singing towers.
What a night that was! The towers sang, and you cried.
Auto destruct in one minute.
You wouldn't tell me why, but I suppose you knew it was time. My time.
Time to come to the library.
You even gave me your screwdriver. That should have been a clue.
There's nothing you can do.
You can let me do this!
If you die here, it'll mean I've never met you.
Time can be re-written.
Not those times.
Not one line. Don't you dare.
It's okay. It's okay. It's not over for you. You'll see me again.
You've got all of that to come.
You and me. Time and space.
You watch us run.
River, you know my name. Auto destruct in...
You whispered my name in my ear.
.. ten, nine, eight, seven...
There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name.
There's only one time I could.
Hush now.
... three.., Spoilers.
. two, one.
Donna! What's happening?
I don't know, but it's not real.
Nothing here is real. The whole world. Everything. None of it is real.
Am I real?
Of course you're real.
I know you're real.
Oh, God! Oh, God! You were real!
(STAMMERING) I'll find you. I promise you, I'll find you.
MAN: Excuse me.
What happened? How did we get here?
Look at you.
You're back!
You're all back. He did it!
(LAUGHING) You're all back. Look at you.
Look at that.
Look at that, he did it.
4,022 people saved.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Please be patient. Only three can teleport at a time.
Do not state your intended destination until you arrive...
Any luck?
There wasn't even anyone called Lee in the library that day.
I suppose he could have had a different name out here, but...
Let's be honest, he wasn't real, was he?
Maybe not.
I made up the perfect man.
Gorgeous, adores me, and hardly able to speak a word.
What does that say about me?
Everything.
Sorry, did I say “everything”? I meant to say "nothing".
I was aiming for “nothing”, I accidentally said “everything”.
Stand right in the middle of the teleport, please. Keep your...
What about you? You all right?
I'm always all right.
Is “all right" special Time Lord code for “really not all right at all"?
Why?
Because I'm all right, too.
Come on.
Your friend, Professor Song.
She knew you in the future, but she didn’t know me, What happens to me?
Because when she heard my name, the way she looked at me...
Donna. This is her diary.
My future.
I could look you up.
What do you think?
Shall we peek at the end?
Spoilers, right?
Right.
Come on.
The next chapter's this way.
SONG: When you run with the Doctor, it feels like it will never end.
But however hard you try, you can't run forever.
Everybody knows that everybody dies.
And nobody knows it like the Doctor.
But I do think that all the skies of all the worlds might just turn dark if he ever, for one moment, accepted...
Why? Why would I give her my screwdriver? Why would I do that?
Future me had years to think about it.
All those years to think of a way to save her.
What he did was give her a screwdriver. Why would I do that?
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Look at that! I'm very good!
What have you done?
Saved her.
Stay with me. You can do it. Stay with me. Come on.
You and me, one last run.
Sorry, River. Shortcut.
Platform disabled.
SONG: Everybody knows that everybody dies.
But not every day.
Not today.
CAL: It's okay. You're safe.
You'll always be safe here.
The Doctor fixed the data core. This is a good place now.
But I was worried you might be lonely, so I brought you some friends.
Aren't I a clever girl?
Aren't we all?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
He just can't do it, can he?
That man. That impossible man.
He just can’t give in.
SONG: Some days are special.
Some days are so, so blessed.
Some days, nobody dies at all.
Now and then, every once in a very long while, every day in a million days when the wind stands fair and the Doctor comes to call...
everybody lives.
Sweet dreams, everyone.
You be careful.
DOCTOR: Taking a big space truck with a bunch of strangers across a diamond planet called Midnight?
What could possibly go wrong?
Enjoy your trip.
Oh, I can't wait.
What the hell is making that noise?
It's trying the door! There is no "it".
(LOUD BANGING) Just tell me what the hell it is!
Down!
If we're gonna get out of this, then you need me.
Oh, like you're so special.
Two people are dead.
Don't make it a third.
It's coming for me. It's coming for me. Help!
Get out of there!  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
(PHONE RINGING) I said, no.
A sapphire waterfall. It's a waterfall made of sapphires!
This enormous jewel the size of a glacier reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion and then shatters into sapphires at the edge, then fall 100,000 feet into a crystal ravine.
I bet you say that to all the girls.
Oh, come on. They're boarding now.
It's no fun if I see it on me own. Four hours, that's all it'll take.
No. That's four hours there and four hours back.
That's like a school trip. I'd rather go sunbathing.
You be careful. That's extonic sunlight.
Oh, I'm safe. It says in the brochure this glass is 15 feet thick.
All right. I give up.
I'll be back for dinner. We'll try that antigravity restaurant, with bibs.
That's a date. Well, not a date. Oh, you know what I mean. Oh, get off.
~See you later.
Oi!
And you be careful, all right?
Nah! Taking a big space truck with a bunch of strangers across a diamond planet called Midnight? What could possibly go wrong?
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) HOSTESS: Complimentary juice pack and complimentary headphones.
WOMAN: Just the headphones, please.
There you go.
That's the headphones for channels 1 to 36.
Mobile link for 3D vidgames, complimentary earplugs, complimentary slippers, complimentary juice pack and complimentary peanuts.
I must warn you that some products may contain nuts.
That'd be the peanuts.
Enjoy your trip.
Oh, I can't wait. Allons-y.
I'm sorry?
It's French for “let's go”.
Fascinating.
Headphones for channels 1 to 36...
No, thank you. Not for us.
Earplugs, please. Thank you.
They call it the sapphire waterfall, but it's no such thing.
Sapphire’s an aluminium oxide, but the glacier is just a compound silicon with iron pigmentation.
Juice packs?
Oh, thank you.
Yes, certainly.
And the pills.
All measured out for you. There you go.
Hobbes. Professor Winfold Hobbes.
I'm the Doctor. Hello.
It's my 14th time.
Oh, my first.
And I'm Dee Dee. Dee Dee Blasco.
Don't bother the man.
Where's my water bottle?
.. complimentary slippers, complimentary juice pack and complimentary peanuts.
I must warn you that some products may contain nuts.
Don't be silly. Come and sit with us. Look, we get slippers.
Jethro, do what your mother says. I'm sitting here.
Oh, he's ashamed of us, but he doesn’t mind us paying, does he?
Oh, don't you two start.
Shall I save the juice pack or have it now?
Look, peach and clementine.
Ladies and gentlemen and variations thereupon, welcome on board the Crusader 50.
If you would fasten your seatbelts, we'll be leaving any moment.
Doors.
(BEEPING) Shields down.
I'm afraid the view is shielded until we reach the Waterfall Palace.
Also, a reminder.
Midnight has no air, so please don't touch the exterior door seals, Fire exit at the rear and should we need to use it, you first.
Now I will hand you over to Driver Joe.
Driver foe at the wheel.
There's been a diamond fall at the Winter Witch Canyon, so we'll be taking a slight detour, as you'll see on the map.
The journey covers 500 kliks to the multifaceted coast.
Duration is estimated at four hours.
Thank you for travelling with us and, as they used to say in the olden days, "Wagons roll.” (BEEPING) For your entertainment, we have the music channel playing retrovids of Earth classics.
Also, the latest artistic installation from Ludovic Klein.
Plus for the youngsters, a rare treat.
The animation archives, Four hours of fun time. Enjoy.
(MUSIC, ANIMATION AND ART EXHIBITION ALL BLARING) # Do it, do it again Do it, do it again... # (MUSIC STOPS) Well, that's a mercy.
Uh, I do apologise, ladies and gentlemen and variations thereupon.
We seem to have had a failure of the entertainment system.
Oh!
Well, what do we do?
We've got four hours of this? Four hours of just sitting here?
Tell you what. We'll have to talk to each other instead.
(ALL LAUGHING) So Biff said, “I'm going swimming.” Oh, I was all ready. Trunks and everything. Noseplug.
He had this little noseplug. You should have seen him.
And I went marching up to the lifeguard, and he was a Shamboni, you know, with those big foreheads.
Great big forehead!
And I said, "Where's the pool?" And he said, "The pool is abstract.” It wasn't a real pool!
It was a concept.
And you were wearing your noseplug?
I was like this.
I'm just a second year student, but I wrote a paper on the lost moon of Poosh.
Professor Hobbes read it, liked it, took me on as researcher, just for the holidays.
Well, he said researcher, but most of the time he's got me fetching and carrying.
But it's all good experience.
And did they ever find it?
Find what?
The lost moon of Poosh.
No, not yet.
Well, maybe that'll be your great discovery one day.
Here's to Poosh.
Poosh.
No, no. I'm with this friend of mine, Donna.
She stayed behind in the Leisure Palace. You?
No. It's just me.
Oh, I've done plenty of that, travelling on my own.
I love it. Do what you want, go anywhere.
I'm still getting used to it.
I've found myself single rather recently, not by choice.
What happened?
Oh, the usual.
She needed her own space, as they say.
A different galaxy, in fact. I reckon that's enough space, don't you?
Yeah.
Thad a friend who went to a different universe.
Well, what's this? Chicken or beef?
I think it's both.
So this is Midnight. Do you see? Bombarded by the sun.
Extonic rays, raw galvanic radiation.
Dee Dee, next slide.
It's my pet project.
Actually, I'm the first person to research this because, you see, the history is fascinating because there is no history.
There is no life in this entire system. There couldn't be.
Before the Leisure Palace Company moved in, no one had come here in all eternity.
No living thing.
But how do you know? I mean, if no one can go outside...
Oh, his imagination. Here we go.
He's got a point, though.
Exactly.
We look upon this world through glass, safe inside our metal box.
Even the Leisure Palace was lowered down from orbit.
And here we are now, crossing Midnight, but never touching it.
(BANGING AND RATTLING) We've stopped.
Have we stopped?
BIFF: Are we there?
We can't be. It's too soon.
HOBBES: No, they don't stop. Crusader vehicles never stop.
If you could just return to your seats, it's just a small delay.
Well, may be just a pit stop.
There's no pit to stop in. I've been on this expedition 14 times.
They never stop.
Well, evidently we have stopped, so there's no point in denying it.
We've broken down.
Thanks, Jethro.
In the middle of nowhere.
That's enough. Now stop it.
Ladies and gentlemen and variations thereupon, we're just experiencing a short delay.
The driver needs to stabilise the engine feeds.
It's perfectly routine, so if you could just stay in your seats...
No, I'm sorry, sir, I...
There you go. Engine expert. Two ticks.
Sorry, if you could just sit down... You're not supposed to be in there!
Sorry, if you could just sit down... You're not supposed to be in there!
Sorry. If you could return to your seat, sir.
Company insurance. Let's see if we can get an early assessment.
So what's the problem, Driver Joe?
We're stabilising the engine feeds. Won't take long.
Um, no, because that's the engine feed, that line there, and it's fine.
And it's a micropetrol engine, so stabilising doesn't make sense, does it?
Sorry, I'm a doctor. I'm very clever. So what's wrong?
We've just stopped. Look, all systems fine.
Everything's working, but we're not moving.
Yeah, you're right. No faults. And who are you?
Claude. I'm the mechanic, trainee.
Nice to meet you. I've sent a distress signal.
They should dispatch a rescue truck, top speed.
How long till they get here?
About an hour.
Well, since we're waiting, should we take a look outside?
Uh...
Lift the screen a bit.
It's 100 percent extonic out there. We'd be vapourised.
No! Those windows are Finitoglass. They'll give you a couple of minutes.
Go on. Live a little.
CLAUDE: Wow.
DOCTOR: That is beautiful.
CLAUDE: Look at all those diamonds, poisoned by the sun.
No one can ever touch them.
Joe, you said we took a detour.
Just about 40 clicks to the west.
Is that a recognised path?
No, it's a new one. The computer worked it out on automatic.
So we're the first.
This piece of ground, no one's ever been here before, Not in the whole of recorded history.
Did you just...
No, sorry. It was nothing.
What did you see?
Just there, that ridge. Like a shadow, just for a second.
What sort of shadow?
(ALARM BEEPING) Extonic rising. Shields down.
Look, look, there it is! There it is!
Where!
What was it?
Just something shifting, something sort of dark, like it was running.
Running which way? “Towards us.
Right, Doctor. Back to your seat.
And, uh, not a word. Rescue's on its way.
If you could close the door. Thank you.
What did they say? Did they tell you? What is it? What's wrong?
Oh, just stabilising. Happens all the time.
I don't need this. I'm on a schedule. This is completely unnecessary.
Back to your seats. Thank you.
Excuse me, Doctor.
They're micropetrol engines, aren't they?
Now, don't bother the man.
My father was a mechanic.
Micropetrol doesn't stabilise. What does stabilise mean?
Well, a bit of flim-flam. Don't worry, they're sorting it out.
So it's not the engine?
Just a little pause, that's all.
How much air have we got?
Professor, it's fine.
What did he say?
Nothing.
VAL: Are we running out of air? HOBBES: I was just speculating.
Is that right, miss? Are we running out of air?
Is that what the captain said?
If you could all just remain calm...
How much air have we got?
Mum, just stop it.
Everything is under control.
It doesn't look like it.
He said it!
It's fine!
(ALL SHOUTING) Quiet!
Thank you.
Now, if you care to listen to my good friend Dee Dee...
Oh, um...
It's just that, well, the air's on a circular filter, so we could stay breathing for 10 years.
DOCTOR: There you go.
And I've spoken to the captain. I can guarantee you, everything's fine.
(POUNDING) What was that?
It must be the metal. We're cooling down. It's just settling.
Rocks. Could be rocks falling.
What I want to know is how long do we have to sit here?
(POUNDING) What is that?
There's someone out there.
Don't be ridiculous.
Like I said, it could be rocks.
We're out in the open. Nothing could fall against the sides.
(POUNDING) Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Is there something out there? Well, anyone?
(POUNDING) What the hell is making that noise?
I'm sorry, but the light out there is extonic.
That means it would destroy any living thing in a split second.
It is impossible for someone to be outside, (POUNDING) Well, what the hell is that, then?
Sir, you really should get back to your seat.
Hello.
(POUNDING) It's moving.
(RATTLING) It's trying the door.
There is no "it". There's nothing out there. Can't be.
(CLANGING) (BANGING) (POUNDING) That's the entrance. Can it get in?
No. That door's on 200-weight hydronics.
~Stop it. Don't encourage them.
Well, what do you think it is?
VAL: Biff, don't!
Mr Kane, better not.
It's cast iron, that door.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Three times! Did you hear that? It did it three times.
It did it three times!
Alright, all right, everyone calm down.
Yeah, but it answered, It answered.
Don't tell me that thing's not alive. It answered him.
(BANGING) I really must insist you get back to your seats!
No, don’t just stand there telling us the rules!
You're the hostess! You're supposed to do something!
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) What the hell's making that noise?
She said she'd get me. Stop it! Make it stop! Make it stop!
Don't just stand there looking at me. It's not my fault. He started it with...
Calm down!
.. he made it worse!
Why couldn't you leave it alone? Stop staring at me!
The rescue's coming...
Calm down!
(POUNDING) It's coming for me.
Oh, it's coming for me. It's coming for me!
It's coming for me.
It's coming for me!
(POUNDING) Get out of there!
(ALL GRUNTING) All right? Okay.
Arms, legs, neck, head, nose. I'm fine.
Everyone else?
How are we? Everyone all right?
HOBBES: Earthquake, must be.
But that's impossible. The ground is fixed. It's solid.
We've got torches. Everyone take a torch.
They're in the back of the seats.
Oh, Jethro. Sweetheart, come here.
Never mind me. What about her?
VAL: What's happened to the seats? BIFF: Who did that?
VAL: They've been ripped up.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's over.
We're still alive. Look, the wall's still intact, eh?
HOSTESS: Joe, Claude?
We're safe.
Driver Joe, can you hear me?
I'm not getting any response. The intercom must be down.
What happened? What was that?
Is it the driver? Have we lost the driver?
The cabin's gone.
Don't be ridiculous.
It can't be gone. How can it be gone?
You saw it.
There was nothing there.
Like it was ripped away.
What are you doing?
That's better. A little bit of light. Thank you. Molto bene.
Do you know what you're doing?
The cabin's gone. You better leave that wall alone.
The cabin can't be gone.
No, it's safe.
Any rupture would automatically seal itself.
Unless something sliced it off.
You're right, the cabin's gone.
But if it gets separated...
It loses integrity.
I'm sorry. They've been reduced to dust.
The driver and the mechanic.
They sent a distress signal. Help is on its way.
They saved our lives. We are gonna get out of here, I promise.
We're still alive and they're gonna find us.
Doctor, look at her.
Right, yeah, sorry. Have we got a medical kit?
JETHRO: Why won't she turn around?
HOBBES: What's her name?
Silvestry. Mrs Sky Silvestry.
Sky?
Can you hear me?
You're all right.
Can you move, Sky?
Just look at me.
That noise from outside, it's stopped.
Well, thank God for that.
But what if it's not outside any more?
What if it's inside?
Inside? Where?
It was heading for her.
Sky?
It's all right, Sky.
Just want you to turn around, face me.
Sky?
Sky.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
Are you hurt?
You don't have to talk.
You don't have to talk.
I'm trying to help. I'm trying to help.
My name's the Doctor.
My name's the Doctor.
Okay, can you stop?
Okay, can you stop?
I'd like you to stop. I'd like you to stop.
Why's she doing that?
Why's she doing that?
She's gone mad.
She's gone mad.
~Stop it.
Stop it.
I said, stop it.
I said, stop it.
I don't think she can.
I don't think she can.
Now stop it. This isn't funny.
Now stop it. This isn't funny.
~Shh, shh, shh, all of you.
Shh, shh, shh, all of you.
My name's Jethro.
My name's Jethro.
Jethro, leave it. Just shut up.
Jethro, leave it. Just shut up.
Why are you repeating?
Why are you repeating?
What is that? Learning?
What is that? Learning?
~Copying?
Copying?
Absorbing.
Absorbing.
The square root of piis 1.77...
BOTH: ... of pi is 1.7724538509055 1602729 8167483341, Wow.
But that's impossible.
But that's impossible.
~She couldn't repeat it.
She couldn't repeat it.
Tell her to stop.
Tell her to stop.
She's driving me mad.
She's driving me mad.
Just make her stop.
Just make her stop.
Stop staring at me.
Stop staring at me.
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE) Now, stop. Stop it, all of you.
(ALL TALKING) 666.
666.
Make her stop.
(HUMMING) That's the backup system.
Well, that's a bit better.
What about the rescue? How long's it going to take?
About 60 minutes, that's all.
Then I suggest we all calm down.
This panic isn't helping.
And that poor woman is evidently in a state of...
(ECHO) ... self-induced hysteria. We should leave her...
Doctor.
I know.
Doctor, now step back.
I think you should leave her...
Leave her...
Alone.
What's she doing?
How could she do that?
She's talking with you.
And with me.
Oh, my God! Biff, what's she doing?
She's repeating.
At exactly the same time.
That's impossible.
There's not even a delay.
Oh, man, that is weird.
I think you should all be very, very quiet.
Have you got that?
How's she doing it?
Mrs Kane, please be quiet.
How can she do that?
She's got my voice! She's got my words!
Darling, be quiet. Hush, now, hush.
She's doing it to me.
Just stop it. All of you, stop it, please.
Now then, Sky, are you Sky?
Is Sky still in there? Mrs Silvestry?
You know exactly what I'm going to say. How are you doing that?
Roast beef.
Bananas.
The Medusa Cascade.
Bang!
Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, Tardis.
Shamble, bobble, dibble, dooble.
Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome. Yes, I am. Thank you.
A,B, C, D, E, F, G, H, 1), KL M,N, 0.
First she repeats, then she catches up. What's the next stage?
Next stage of what?
It's not her, is it? That's not Mrs Silvestry any more.
I don't think so, no.
(SOBBING) I think the more we talk, the more she learns.
Now, I'm all for education, but in this case, maybe not.
Let's just move back. Come on, come with me.
Everyone, get back, all of you, as far as you can.
Doctor, make her stop.
Val, come with me. Come to the back. Stop looking at her.
Come on. Jethro, you, too. Everyone, come on.
50 minutes, that's all we need.
50 minutes till the rescue arrives and she's not exactly strong. Look at her.
All she's got is our voices.
I can't look at her. It's those eyes.
We must not look at goblin men.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's a poem, Christina Rossetti.
“We must not look at goblin men, We must not buy their fruits: “Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry thirsty roots?" Actually, I don't think that's helping.
She's not a goblin or a monster.
~She's just a very sick woman.
Maybe that’s why it went for her.
There is no “it”.
Think about it, though.
That knocking went all the way around the bus until it found her.
And she was the most scared out of all of us.
Maybe that's what it needed. That's how it got in.
For the last time, nothing can live on the surface of Midnight.
Professor, I'm glad you've got an absolute definition of life in the universe, but perhaps the universe has got ideas of its own.
Now trust me, I've got previous.
I think there might well be some consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry, but maybe she's still in there and it's our job to help her.
You can help, but I'm not going near.
No, I've got to stay back.
‘Cause if she's copying us, then maybe the final stage is becoming us.
I don't want her becoming me or things could get a whole lot worse.
Oh, like you're so special.
As it happens, yes, I am.
So that's decided. We stay back and we wait.
When the rescue ship comes, we can get her to hospital.
We should throw her out.
I beg your pardon?
~Can we do that?
Don't be ridiculous.
That thing, whatever it is, killed the driver and the mechanic and I don't think she's finished yet.
She can't even move.
Look at her. Look at her eyes.
She killed Joe and she killed Claude and we're next.
She's still doing it. Just stop it! Stop talking! Stop it!
Biff, don't, sweetheart!
But she won't stop!
We can't throw her out, though. We can't even open the doors.
No one is getting thrown out.
Yes, we can ‘cause there's an air pressure seal.
Like when you opened the cabin door, you weren't pulled out.
You had a couple of seconds ‘cause it takes the pressure wall about six seconds to collapse.
Well, six seconds exactly.
That's enough time to throw someone out.
Thanks, Dee Dee. Just what we needed.
Would it kill her outside?
I don't know.
But she's got a body now. It'd certainly kill the physical...
No one is killing anyone!
I wouldn't risk the cabin door twice, but we've got that one.
All we need to do is grab hold of her and throw her out.
Now listen, all of you, for all we know that's a brand-new life form over there and if it's come inside to discover us, then what's it found?
This little bunch of humans.
What do you amount to? Murder?
‘Cause this is where you decide. You decide who you are.
Could you actually murder her, any of you?
Really?
Or are you better than that?
I'd do it.
So would I.
And me.
I think we should.
What?
I want her out.
You can't say that.
I'm sorry, but you said it yourself, Doctor.
She's growing in strength. That's not what I said.
I wanna go home. I'm sorry. I want to be safe.
You'll be safe. Any minute now. The rescue truck is on its way.
And what happens then, Doctor?
If it takes that thing back to the Leisure Palace, if that thing reaches civilisation, what if it spreads?
No, because when we get back to the base, I'll be there to contain it.
You haven't done much so far.
He's just standing at the back with the rest of us.
She's dangerous.
It's my job to see that this vessel is safe. We should get rid of her.
Now hang on. I think perhaps we're all going a little bit too far.
At last! Thank you.
Two people are dead!
Don't make it a third!
Jethro, what do you say?
I'm net killing anyone.
Thank you.
He's just a boy.
What, so I don't get a vote?
There isn't a vote. It's not happening, ever!
If you try to throw her out that door, you'll have to get past me first.
Okay.
Fine by me.
Oh, now you're being stupid. Just think about it.
Could you actually take hold of someone and throw them out of that door?
Calling me a coward?
Who put you in charge anyway? I'm sorry.
You're a doctor of what exactly?
He wasn't even booked in.
The rest of you, tickets in advance, he just turned up out of the blue.
VAL: Where from?
I'm just travelling. I'm a traveller, that's all.
Like an immigrant?
Who were you talking to?
Before you got on board, you were talking to someone. Who was that?
Just Donna. Just my friend.
What were you saying to her?
He hasn't even told us his name.
The thing is though, Doctor, you've been loving this.
Oh, Jethro, not you.
No, but ever since all the trouble has started, you've been loving it.
It has to be said, you do seem to have a certain glee.
Alright, I'm interested, yes. I can't help it.
‘Cause whatever's inside her, it's brand-new and that's fascinating.
What, you wanted this to happen?
No!
You were talking to her.
All on your own, before all the trouble, right at the front, you were talking to that Sky woman, the two of you together.
I saw you!
We all did.
You went into the cabin.
What were you saying to her?
I was just talking.
Saying what?
You called us "humans", like you're not one of us.
That's what he said.
And the wiring.
He went into that panel and opened up the wiring.
That was after.
But how did you know what to do?
Because I'm clever!
I see.
Well, that makes things clear.
And what are we, then? Idiots?
That's not what I meant.
If you're clever, then what are we?
You've been looking down on us from the moment we walked in.
Even if he goes, he's practically volunteered.
Oh, come on! Just listen to yourselves, please!
Do you mean... We throw him out as well.
If we have to.
Look, just...
Hang on, sorry, yes, hold on, just...
I know you're scared. And so am I. Look at me, I am.
But we have all got to calm down and cool off and think.
Perhaps you could tell us your name.
What does it matter?
Then tell us.
John Smith.
Your real name.
He's lying. Look at his face.
His eyes are the same as hers.
Why won't you tell us?
It's a symptom.
He's been lying to us right from the start!
No one’s called John Smith. Come off it!
Listen to me right now because you need me, all of you!
If we are going to get out of this, then you need me!
So you keep saying. You've been repeating yourself more than her.
If anyone's in charge, it should be the professor. He's the expert!
Mum, just stop. Just look.
You keep out of this, Jethro.
Look at her!
She's stopped.
When did she...
When did she...
No, she's still doing it.
No, she's still doing it.
She looks the same to me.
No. She's stopped.
Look, I'm talking and she's not.
BIFF: What about me? Is she...
Look. Look at that. She's not doing me. She's let me go.
Mrs Silvestry?
Nor me. Nothing.
Sky? “Sky?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
She's still doing him.
Doctor, it's you. She's only copying you.
Why me? Why are you doing this?
Why me? Why are you doing this?
VAL: She won't leave him alone. Do you see?
I said so. She's with him.
They're together.
How do you explain it, Doctor? If you're so clever...
I don't know.
I don't know.
~Sky, stop it. Sky, stop it.
I said, stop it. Just stop it.
I said, stop it. Just stop it.
Look at the two of them.
BOTH: Mrs Silvestry, I'm trying to understand.
You've captured my speech. What for?
What do you need?
You need my voice in particular.
The cleverest voice in the room.
Why? Because I'm the only one who can help?
Oh, I'd love that to be true.
But your eyes, they're saying something else.
Listen to me, whatever you want, if it's life or form or consciousness or voice, you don't have to steal it.
You can find it without hurting anyone.
And I'll help you.
That's a promise.
So, what do you think?
SKY: Do we have a deal? DOCTOR: Do we have a deal?
Hold on. Did she...
She spoke first.
She can't have.
She did. She spoke first.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, look at that. I'm ahead of you.
I'm ahead of you.
Did you see?
She spoke before he did, definitely.
He's copying her.
Doctor, what's happening?
SKY: I think it's moved.
I think it's moved.
I think it's letting me go.
I think it’s letting me go.
DEE DEE: What do you mean? Letting you go from what?
BIFF: He's repeating now. He's the one doing it. It's him.
JETHRO: He's separating.
Mrs Silvestry, is that you?
Yes. Yes. It's me.
Yes. Yes. It's me.
I'm coming back.
Listen, it’s me. I'm coming back. Listen, it's me.
It's like it's passed into the Doctor. It's transferred.
Whatever it is, it's gone inside him.
No, that's not what happened.
Look at her.
Look at me.
I can move.
Look at me.
I can feel again.
I'm coming back to life.
I can move.
I can feel again.
And look at him. I'm coming back to life.
He can't move.
And look at him.
He can't move.
Help me.
@@@@@@
@@@@@@
You are gonna love this! One, two, three.
Hmm!
Ah!
It's lovely.
You want to buy Shukina?
TRADER: Peshwami? Most beautiful Peshwami in all of Shan Shen.
Oh, no. Thanks.
Tell your fortune, lady?
The future predicted. Your life foretold.
Oh, no thanks.
Don't you want to know if you're going to be happy?
I'm happy right now, thanks.
You got red hair. The reading's free for red hair.
All right, then.
Oh, you're fascinating.
No, but you're good.
I can see a man.
The most remarkable man.
How did you meet him?
You're supposed to tell me.
I see the future.
Tell me the past.
When did your lives cross?
It's sort of complicated.
I ended up in his spaceship on my wedding day.
Long story.
But what led you to that meeting?
All sorts of things.
But my job, I suppose.
It was on Earth, this planet called Earth. Miles away.
But I had this job, as a temp.
I was a secretary at a place called HC Clements.
WOMAN: HC Clements. Can I help you?
Oh...
Sorry.
It's the incense.
Just breathe deep.
This job of yours, what choices led you there?
There was a choice. Six months before, ‘Cause the agency offered me this contract at HC Clements, DONNA: There was this other job. My mum knew this man.
SYLVIA: Jival, he's called.
Jival Chowdry.
He runs that little photocopy business and he needs a secretary.
I've got a job.
As a temp. This is permanent.
It's 20,000 a year, Donna.
HC Clements is in the City.
It's nice, it's posh, so stop it.
Your life could have gone one way or the other.
What made you decide?
I just did.
But when was the moment? When did you choose?
It won't take long. Just turn right.
We'll pop in and see Mr Chowdry, so Suzette can introduce you.
I'm going left. If you don't like it, get out and walk.
If you turn right, you'll have a career, not just filling-in.
You think I'm so useless.
Oh, I know why you want a job with HC Clements, lady.
‘Cause you think you'll meet a man with lots of money and your whole life will change.
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart, City executives don't need temps.
Except for practice.
Yeah. Well, they haven't met me.
FORTUNE TELLER: You turned left.
But what if you'd turned right? What then?
Let go of my hands.
What if it changes?
What if you go right? What if you could still go right?
Stop it.
(CREATURE RATTLING) What was that?
What's on my back?
What is it? What's on my back?
Make the choice again, Donna Noble, and change your mind.
Turn right.
I'm turning.
Turn right.
Turn right. Turn right.
Let me tell you, sweetheart, City executives don't need temps.
Except for practice.
Yeah. Suppose you're right.
FORTUNE TELLER: Turn right and never meet that man.
Turn right and change the world.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) # We wish you a merry Christmas # We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas DONNA: Get out of the way.
# And a happy New Year # DONNA: Get out of the way!
(ALL CHEERING) Here we are. Feed at the trough.
Mooky says let's go to the Boardwalk. It's two-for-the-price-of-one.
Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving.
Well, exactly. Get in and grab ‘em.
That's the second round of drinks you've bought. It was my turn.
I can afford it. Promotion.
You are talking to Jival Chowdry's Personal Assistant, I'll have you know.
Capital P, capital A, £23,000 per annum. Merci beaucoup!
Here's to Mr Chowdry.
ALL: Mr Chowdry.
WOMAN: She gets all the luck.
What's wrong? What is it?
(RATTLING) Sorry?
Did someone spill a drink on me?
No.
Why do you keep looking at my shoulder? What's wrong?
I don't know.
Don't tell me you're getting all spooky again.
It was bad enough when you saw the ghost of Earl Mountbatten at the Boat Show. What are you looking at?
What is it?
It's like...
(RATTLING) It's like there's something I can't see.
MAN: No, shut up! All of you! Come and see, Just look at the sky! It's a star!
It's a Christmas star!
Well, come on, then.
What the hell is that?
Ken Livingston, that's what.
Spending our money on decorations. I mean, how much did that cost?
Don't be so stupid. It's flying, it's really flying!
That's not a star, that's a web.
It's headed east. Middle of the City.
(RATTLING) (SCREAMING) Alice, there's a great big web-star-thing shooting at people and you're looking at me.
There's something on your back.
Donna! Where you going?
You'll get yourself killed! Donna!
Fire!
MAN: Everyone stay back. The Thames has been closed.
Return to your homes.
Keep away from the river, and that's an order.
(SIREN BLARING) ON RADIO: Trap 1 to Greyhound 15, what is your report? Over.
From the evidence, I'd say he managed to stop the creature.
Some sort of red spider.
Blew up the base underneath the barrier, flooded the whole thing. Over.
And where is he now? Over.
We've found a body, sir. Over.
Is it him? Over.
I think so. He just didn't make it out in time.
The Doctor is dead.
It must have happened too fast for him to regenerate.
Escort the ambulance back to UNIT base.
What happened? What did they find? Sorry, did they find someone?
I don't know. Bloke called the Doctor or something.
Where is he?
They took him away. He's dead.
I'm sorry. Did you know him?
I mean, they didn't say his name.
It could be any doctor.
I came so far.
It could be anyone.
What's your name?
Donna.
And you?
Oh, I was just passing by.
I shouldn't even be here. This is wrong.
This is wrong. This is so wrong.
(RATTLING) Sorry, what was it? Donna what?
Why do you keep looking at my back?
I'm not.
Yes, you are.
You keep looking behind me. You're doing it now.
What is it? What's there? Did someone put something on my back?
You can't sack me!
I'm your personal assistant!
You don't have to make a scene.
Just come downstairs and we can have a little talk.
I'll make a scene, all right, right in front of a tribunal.
And the first thing I'm gonna say is “Wandering hands!" Come on, Donna. You know what it's been like for the past few months, ever since that Christmas thing.
Half my contracts were on the other side of the river, and the Thames is still closed off.
Look, I can't deliver. I'm losing a fortune.
Well, sack one of this lot! Sack Cliff!
He just sits there. I don't know what he does all day. Sorry, Cliff.
Actually, I'm not sorry. What do you do all day?
What the hell?
(GLASS SHATTERING) Like an earthquake. That's weird.
Funny sort of clouds.
Who typed this? I'm your PA. Did you get someone else to type this?
Beatrice!
It sounds impossible, but the entire hospital has vanished.
The Royal Hope no longer exists.
It's not been destroyed, there's no wreckage, it's simply gone.
Reports from bystanders say that the rain lifted up around the hospital...
Hole punch, having that. Stapler. Mine.
Toy cactus, you can have that, Beatrice. Catch.
Cliff, I'd leave you my mouse mat, but I'm worried you'd cut yourself.
Alright, Donna, have some respect. There's 2,000 people in that hospital.
And it's vanished. I'll show you vanishing.
Thanks for nothing!
Oh, and you know when that money went missing from the kitty?
Anne Marie. That's all I'm saying. Anne Marie!
(CRASHING) Oh, don't tell me. The hospital's back.
Well, isn't that wizard?
To confirm, the Royal Hope Hospital was returned to its original position, but with only one survivor.
The only person left alive is medical student Oliver Morgenstern.
.. and there were these creatures.
Like rhinos, Talking rhinos in black leather.
Rhinos?
Rhinos could be aliens.
Shush.
MORGENSTERN: We couldn't breathe, we were running out of air.
A colleague of mine gave me the last oxygen tank.
Martha. Martha Jones, And she died.
Least you've got a hole punch.
And a raffle ticket.
Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle. I wouldn't take a penny off that man.
Honestly, you two. There's aliens on the news, They took that hospital all the way to the moon and you're banging on about raffle tickets, Don't be daft, Gramps. It wasn't the moon, it couldn't be.
Yes, well, I am telling you, it is getting worse.
These past few years, it's like all of a sudden, they suddenly know all about us.
There's keen eyes up there and they're watching us, and they're not friendly.
This stapler says "Bea".
Can't believe how well you're taking it, me getting sacked.
Thought you'd hit the roof.
I'm just tired, Donna.
What with your father and everything.
To be honest, I've given up on you.
.. this further report just in from Oliver Morgenstern.
There was this woman who took control. Said she knew what to do.
Said she could stop the MRI or something.
Sarah Jane her name was. Sarah Jane Smith.
Sarah Jane Smith was a freelance investigative journalist, formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.
Her body was recovered from the hospital late this afternoon.
What's for tea? I've got nothing in.
I'll get chips. Last of my wages. Fish and chips, yeah?
... along with his teenage friends Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer.
It is feared that they also perished.
DONNA: Blimey, you all right?
What was that, fireworks?
I dunno. I was just walking along. That's weird.
You're the one.
Christmas Eve, I met you in town.
Donna, isn't it?
What was your name?
How're you doing? You're looking good. How's things? What you been up to?
You're doing it again.
What?
Looking behind me.
(RATTLING) People keep on doing that. Looking at my back.
What sort of people?
People in the street. Strangers.
I just catch them sometimes. Staring at me.
Like they're looking at something.
And then I get home and I look and there's nothing there.
(RATTLING) See, look? Now I'm doing it.
What are you doing for Christmas?
What am I what?
Next Christmas.
Any plans?
I don't know. That's ages away.
Nothing much, I suppose. Why?
Just, I think you should get out, you and your family.
Don't stay in London. Just leave the city.
What for?
Nice hotel. Christmas break.
Can't afford it.
Well, no, you've got that raffle ticket.
How do you know about that?
First prize.
Luxury weekend break.
Use it, Donna Noble.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I think you should leave me alone.
(PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) #.,. a red-nosed reindeer... # GRANDDAD: Cor blimey, that's what I call posh.
I said you were lucky. Didn't I always say? My lucky star.
For God's sake, don't tell them that we won it in a raffle. Be classy.
Dad, take those things off.
No, I shan't. It's Christmas.
Oi, I'll have that one, thank you. It's got my liniment in it.
I reckon we deserve this. It's been a hell of a year.
Your dad would've loved this.
Yeah. He would've.
(CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Oi, Gramps, get that. That'll be breakfast.
We've got croissants.
Why can't you get it, Lady Muck?
It's Christmas Day, I never get up before ten.
Only madam there was up with the dawn chorus.
Like when she was six years old.
I'm not wasting a second in this place.
How was the sofa?
Oh, yeah.
Not so good, really. Oh, God...
(GROANING) You know, we could've paid for a second room.
(WHISTLING) Oi!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Dad.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah, all right. Come on in, my darling. Grub's up.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, sir.
TV: We interrupt this programme to bring you breaking news.
SYLVIA: Have you seen this?
DONNA: I thought nice early breakfast, then we'll go for a walk.
People always say that at Christmas, "Oh, we all went for a walk.” I've always wanted to do that.
So, walk first, presents later, yeah?
Donna, come and see.
(SPEAKING SPANISH) What?
Donna, look at the telly.
(SPEAKING SPANISH) What does that mean?
I don't know what you're saying.
Donna, look at the TV.
(SPEAKING SPANISH) (RATTLING) For God's sake, Donna, don't just stand there, come and look!
. how this is possible, but this footage is live and genuine.
The object is falling on Central London.
I repeat, this is not a hoax, a replica of the Titanic is falling out of the sky and it's heading for Buckingham Palace.
We're getting this footage from the Guinevere range of satellites.
Is that a film or something?
The Royal Air Force has declared an emer...
(CRASHING) It's gone dead.
All of them.
No, but the Titanic?
Oh, don't be daft.
Is that like a sequel?
Oh!
Oh, God rest their souls.
(RUMBLING) I was supposed to be out there selling papers.
I should've been there. We all should.
We'd be dead.
That's everyone.
Every single person we know.
The whole city.
Can't be, But it is. It's gone.
London's gone.
If you hadn't won that raffle...
Leeds? I'm not moving to Leeds!
I'm afraid it's Leeds, or you can wait in the hostel for another three months, All I want is a washing machine.
What about Glasgow? I heard there was jobs going in Glasgow.
You can't pick and choose.
We've the whole of southern England flooded with radiation, seven million people in need of relocation, and now France has closed its borders. So it's Leeds or nothing. Next!
SOLDIER ON MEGAPHONE: The Daniels family, billeted at number 15.
Mr and Mrs Obego, billeted at number 31.
Miss Coltrane, you're in number 8.
The Noble family, billeted at number 29.
That's us. Come on, off we go.
GRANDDAD: All right?
Used to be a nice little family, number 29.
They missed one mortgage payment, just one, they got booted out, all for you lot.
Don't get all chippy with me, Vera Duckworth.
Pop your clogs on and go and feed whippets.
Sweetheart, come on.
You're not gonna make the world any better by shouting at it.
I can try.
What happens? Do we get keys?
I don't know, do I?
Who do we ask, the soldiers?
Hey! Is a big house. Room for all.
Welcome. In you come.
I thought this was our house.
Is many people's house. Is wonderful. In, in, in.
We been here for eight weeks already.
Thad a nice little paper shop in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now.
So, upstairs, we have the Merchandani family, seven of them, good family, good kids.
Except that one, be careful of him.
Tis joking!
Where's that smile, eh?
Rocco Colasanto. I'm here with my wife, and her sister and her husband and their kids, and their daughter's kids.
We've got the front room, and my mother, she's got the back room.
She's old, you forgive her.
And this, this is you.
This is your palazzo!
What do you mean, this is us?
You live here.
We're living in the kitchen?
You got camp beds.
You got the cooker, you keep warm, you got the fridge, you keep cool. Is good.
What about the bathroom?
Nobody lives in the bathroom.
No, I mean, is there a rota?
(LAUGHING) Is pot luck. Is fun!
I go wake Mama, she likes new people.
Mama! Is people! Nice people!
Ah, well.
We'll settle in, won't we? Make do.
Bit of wartime spirit, eh?
But there isn't a war. There's no fight.
There's just this.
Well, America, they'll save us. It was on the news.
They're gonna send Great Britain 50 billion quid in financial aid.
God bless America.
America is in crisis with over 60 million reported dead.
Sixty million people have dissolved into fat.
And the fat is walking.
People's fat has come to life and is walking through the streets.
And there are spaceships.
There are reports of spaceships over every major US city.
The fat is flying. It’s leaving...
Aliens.
Yeah.
Mary McGinty, do you remember her?
Who was she?
Worked in the newsagent's on a Sunday.
Little woman, black hair.
Never really spoke to her. She'll be dead.
Every day I think of someone else. All dead.
Maybe she went away for Christmas.
Maybe.
I'll go out tomorrow. I'll walk into town.
There's got to be work. Everyone needs secretaries.
Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.
Just you wait, Mum.
What if it never gets better?
Of course it will.
Even the bees are disappearing. You don't see bumblebees any more.
They'll sort us out, the Emergency Government.
They'll do something.
What if they don't?
Then we'll complain.
Who's gonna listen to us? Refugees.
We haven't even got a vote. We're just no one, Donna.
(MEN SINGING) We don't exist.
# And I spent all my money on whisky and beer... # Tam going to kill that man!
(SINGING CONTINUES) Now listen, Mussolini!
I am telling you for the last time to button it!
If I hear one more sea shanty...
Always loved a sing-song.
# I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me # He's just a poor boy From a poor family # Spare him his life from this monstrosity # Easy come, easy go Will you let me go... # (MACHINE GUN FIRING) No, you stay here.
Everyone, stay!
Hey, firing at the car is not so good!
You crazy or what?
It's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop. It's like gas, it's toxic.
Well, switch it off!
I have done. It's still going.
It's all the cars, every single ATMOS car. They've gone mad.
(RATTLING) You! Lady, turn round. Turn around!
“Al re you crazy, boy?
Now! .
Put that gun down!
I said, turn around!
Do what he says! Turn around!
Show me your back!
Now! Show me your back!
Sorry, I thought I saw...
Call yourself a soldier?
Pointing guns at innocent women. You're a disgrace.
In my day, we would have had you court-martialled!
Donna, where are you going? It's not safe at night!
Donna! Donna!
Hello.
Hi.
It's the ATMOS devices.
We're lucky, it's not so bad here, Britain hasn't got that much petrol.
But all over Europe, China, South Africa, they're getting choked by gas.
Can't anyone stop it?
Yeah, they're trying right now.
This little band of fighters, on board the Sontaran ship.
Any second now.
And that was...?
That was the Torchwood team.
Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones, they gave their lives.
And Captain Jack Harkness has transported to the Sontaran homeworld.
There's no one left.
You're always wearing the same clothes.
Why won't you tell me your name?
None of this was meant to happen.
There was a man, this wonderful man, and he stopped it.
The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS, he stopped them all from happening.
That doctor?
You knew him.
Did I?
When?
I think you dream about him sometimes.
It's a man in a suit.
Tall, thin man, Great hair.
Some really great hair.
Who are you?
I was like you.
I used to be you. ‘Cause you've travelled with him, Donna, you travelled with the Doctor in a different world, I never met him. And he's dead.
He died underneath the Thames on Christmas Eve.
But you were meant to be there.
He needed someone to stop him, and that was you. You made him leave.
You saved his life, (SCREAMING) Doctor, you can stop now.
Stop it! I don't know what you're talking about. Leave me alone.
Something is coming, Donna. Something worse.
The whole world is stinking.
How could anything be worse than this?
Trust me. We need the Doctor more than ever. I've...
I've been pulled across from a different universe because every single universe is in danger.
It's coming, Donna.
It's coming from across the stars and nothing can stop it.
What is?
The darkness.
Well, what do you keep telling me for?
What am I supposed to do?
I'm nothing special. I mean, I'm...
I'm not... I'm nothing special. I'm a temp.
I'm not even that. I'm nothing.
Donna Noble, you're the most important woman in the whole of creation.
Oh, don't.
Just don't.
I'm tired.
I'm so tired.
I need you to come with me.
Yeah, well.
Blonde hair might work on the men, but you ain't shifting me, lady.
That's more like it.
I've got plenty more.
But you'll come with me.
Only when you want to.
You'll have a long wait, then.
Not really, just three weeks.
Tell me, does your grandfather still own that telescope?
He never lets go of it.
Three weeks’ time.
But you've got to be certain.
‘Cause when you come with me, Donna, I'm sorry, so sorry, but you're going to die.
(WHOOPING) And you! I'm gonna miss you most of all.
All flame-haired and fiery.
Oh, but why do you have to go?
Is the new law. England for the English, et cetera.
They can't send us home, the oceans are closed.
They build labour camps.
I know, but labour doing what? There aren't any jobs.
Sewing, digging, is good.
Now, stop it before I kiss you too much.
Wilfred.
My capitano.
DONNA: It'll be quiet with him gone. Still, we'll have more room.
Labour camps.
That's what they called them last time.
What do you mean?
It's happening again.
What is?
Excuse me. Excuse me, where are you taking them?
Where are you going? Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Where are you going!
I asked about jobs, with the army.
They said I wasn't qualified.
You were right.
You said I should have worked harder at school.
I suppose I've always been a disappointment.
Yeah.
You know, we'd get a bit of cash if we sold this thing.
Don't you dare.
I always imagined your old age, I'd have put a bit of money by.
Make you comfy.
Never did.
I'm just useless.
You're supposed to say, "No, you're not.” Ah, it must be the alignment.
What's wrong?
Well, I dunno. It can't be the lens ‘cause I was looking at Orion.
The constellation of Orion.
You take a look. Now tell me, what can you see?
Where?
Well, up there, in the sky.
Well, I can't see anything. It's just black.
Well, I mean, it's working. The telescope is working.
Well, maybe it's clouds.
There is no clouds.
Well, there must be.
There's not. It was there.
An entire constellation.
Look!
Look there.
They're going out.
Oh, my God!
Donna, look, the stars are going out.
I'm ready.
VOICE ON PA: lodestone testing now at 15.4.
Repeat, 15.4.
Ma’am.
ROSE: I've told you, don't salute.
Well, if you're not going to tell us your name.
DONNA: You don't know either?
I've crossed too many different realities, trust me, the wrong word in the wrong place can change an entire causal nexus.
She talks like that. A lot.
And you must be Miss Noble.
Donna.
Captain Erisa Magambo. Thank you for this.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
Is it awake?
Seems to be quiet today. Ticking over.
Like it's waiting.
Do you want to see it?
What's a police box?
They salvaged it from underneath the Thames. Just go inside.
What for?
Just go in.
DONNA: No way!
(CHUCKLING) What do you think?
Can I have a coffee?
Time And Relative Dimension in Space.
This room used to shine with light. I think it's dying.
(HUMMING) It's still trying to help.
And it belonged to the Doctor?
He was a Time Lord.
Last of his kind.
But if he was so special, what was he doing with me?
He thought you were brilliant.
Don't be stupid.
But you are.
It just took the Doctor to show you that, simply by being with him.
He did the same to me, to everyone he touches.
Were you and him...
(RATTLING) Do you want to see it? “No.
Go on, then.
We don't know how the Tardis works, but we've managed to scrape off the surface technology.
Enough to show you the creature.
It's a creature?
just stand here.
Out of the circle, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Can't you stay with me?
Ready?
And activate.
Open your eyes, Donna.
Is it there?
Open your eyes. Look at it.
“I can't.
It's part of you, Donna. Look.
(CREATURE RATTLING) It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, calm down.
Donna, Donna, Donna! Okay.
(CREATURE RATTLING) What is it?
We don't know.
Oh, thanks.
It feeds off time.
By changing time, by making someone's life take a different turn.
Like meetings never made.
Children never born.
A life never loved.
But with you it's...
But I never did anything important.
Yeah, you did.
One day that thing made you turn right instead of left.
When was that?
You wouldn't remember.
It was the most ordinary day in the world.
But by turning right, you never met the Doctor and the whole world just changed around you.
Can you get rid of it?
I can't even touch it.
Seems to be in a state of flux.
What does that mean?
I don't know. Sort of thing the Doctor would say.
You liar!
You told me I was special!
But it's not me, it's this thing!
I'm just a host!
No, there's more than that.
The readings are strange.
It's like reality is just bending around you.
Because of this thing!
No, no, we're getting separate readings from you.
And they've always been there, since the day you were born.
This is not relevant to the mission.
I thought it was just the Doctor we needed, but it's the both of you.
The Doctor and Donna Noble. Together.
To stop the stars from going out.
Why?
What can I do?
(CREATURE RATTLING) Turn it off.
Please.
Captain.
Power down.
It's still there, though.
What can I do to get rid of it?
You're going to travel in time.
The Tardis has tracked down the moment of intervention, Monday 25th, one minute past ten in the morning.
Your car was on Little Sutton Street, leading to the Ealing Road, but you turned right, heading towards Griffin's Parade.
You need to turn left. That's the most important thing.
You've got to go back, turn Left.
Have you got that, Donna? One minute past ten, make yourself turn left, heading for the Chiswick High Road.
Keep the jacket on at all times.
It's insulation against temporal feedback.
This will correspond to local time wherever you land.
This is to combat dehydration.
This is where we leave you.
I don't want to see that thing on my back.
No, the mirrors are just incidental.
They bounce Chronon Energy back into the centre which we control and decide the destination.
It's a time machine.
It's a time machine.
If you could.
Powering up.
How do you know it's gonna work?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah, we don't.
We're just guessing.
Brilliant.
Just remember, when you get to the junction, change the car's direction by one minute past ten.
How do I do that?
That's up to you.
Well...
I'll just have to run up to myself, and have a good argument.
I'd like to see that.
Activate lodestone, Good luck.
I'm ready.
One minute past ten.
‘Cause I understand now.
You said I was gonna die, but you mean this whole world is gonna blink out of existence.
But that's not dying, ‘cause a better world takes its place.
The Doctor's world.
And I'm still alive, That's right, isn't it? I don't die.
If I change things, I don't die. That's right, isn’t it?
I'm sorry.
But I can't die.
I've got a future.
With the Doctor. You told me.
Activate!
(RADIO PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC) (CHEERING) Hold on.
But this is... I'm not...
This is Sutton Court.
I'm half a mile away. I'm half a mile away!
Four minutes.
Oh, my God.
(DONNA PANTING) Jival Chowdry.
He runs that little photocopy business in Merchant Street and he needs a secretary.
I've got a job.
(DONNA PANTING) HC Clements is in the City.
It's nice, it's posh, so stop it.
(BEEPING) It won't take long, just turn right.
I'm going left. If you don't like it, get out and walk.
You think I'm so useless.
Oh, I know why you want a job with HC Clements, lady.
‘Cause you think you'll meet a man.
How long... How long...
I'm not gonna get there.
You're gonna die.
City executives don't need temps. Except for practice.
Yeah.
I suppose you're right.
Please.
(TYRES SCREECHING) Can you hear that?
Hold on. Back up.
0i, get a move on!
The traffic's stopping.
Something must've happened.
Tell him this.
Two words, Well, that decides it. I'm not sitting in a traffic jam.
(ECHOING) I'm going left.
(ECHOING) Left, left left.
What the hell is that?
You were so strong.
What are you?
What will you be?
What will you be?
Everything all right?
Oh, God!
(CHUCKLING) What's that for?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
It's slipping away.
You know like when you try and think of a dream and it sort of goes.
Just got lucky, this thing. It's one of the Trickster's Brigade.
It changes a life in tiny little ways.
Most times the universe just compensates around it, but with you...
Great big parallel world.
Hold on, you said parallel worlds were sealed off.
They are. But you had one created around you.
Funny thing is, seems to be happening a lot.
To you.
How do you mean?
Well, the Library and then this.
Just goes with the job, I suppose.
Sometimes I think there's way too much coincidence around you, Donna.
I met you once. Then I met your grandfather.
Then I met you again.
In the whole wide universe, I met you for a second time.
It's like something's binding us together.
Don't be so daft.
I'm nothing special.
Yes, you are, you're brilliant.
He thought you were brilliant.
She said that.
Who did?
That woman.
I can't remember.
Well, she never existed now.
No, but she said the stars...
She said the stars are going out.
Yeah, but that world's gone.
No, but she said it was all worlds. Every world.
She said the darkness is coming. Even here.
Who was she?
I don't know.
What did she look like?
She was...
Blonde.
What was her name?
I don't know.
Donna, what was her name?
But she told me to warn you.
She said, "Two words." What two words? What were they? What did she say?
Bad wolf.
What does it mean?
Doctor, what is it? What's bad wolf?
(CLOISTER BELL TOLLING) It's the end of the universe.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.
It can't be.
There's nothing I can do.
Oh, my God!
What is it? Who are they?
What are we going to do?
It's impossible.
It can't be.
I'm sorry, we're dead.
Doctor, come back!
(MECHANICAL LAUGHING) It's only just beginning.  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
It's fine.
Everything's fine.
Nothing's wrong. It's all fine.
Excuse me, what day is it?
Saturday.
Saturday. Good.
Good. I like Saturdays.
So I just met Rose Tyler?
Yeah.
But she's locked away in a parallel world.
Exactly. If she can cross from her parallel world to your parallel world then that means the walls of the universe are breaking down, which puts everything in danger. Everything.
But how?
Thing is, Doctor, no matter what's happening, and I'm sure it's bad, I get that.
But Rose is coming back.
Isn't that good?
Yeah.
(EXPLOSION) What the hell was that?
Don't know. It came from outside.
But we're in space.
How did it happen?
What did you do?
We haven't moved. We're fixed.
It can't have. No!
Tardis is still in the same place, but the Earth has gone.
The entire planet!
It's gone.
MAN: Give me a cigarette. Right now. Confirm all stations still online.
Can anyone hear me? Have we got contact with UNIT base...
What was that?
WOMAN: Emergency systems online.
Was it some sort of earthquake or...
WOMAN: Get the system operational...
Jalandra, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Is anyone hurt?
MARTHA: We've lost power. Someone get the lights back on.
DaCosta, see to it right now.
Suzanne, are you okay?
Martha, look at the sky.
Why, what is it?
Just look at the sky!
Whoa, what happened?
Is it the rift? Gwen, Ianto, you okay?
No broken bones. Slight loss of dignity. No change there, then.
The whole of the city must've felt that. The whole of South Wales.
I'm gonna take a look outside.
A little bit bigger than South Wales.
Luke, are you all right?
It felt like some sort of cross-dimensional spatial transference.
But it's night. It wasn't night. It was 8:00 in the morning!
Mr Smith, I need you!
I wish you'd stop giving that fanfare and just tell me what happened!
Sarah Jane, I think you should look outside, I'll think you'll find the visual evidence most conclusive.
It's gone dark. It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension.
What do you want this time, you green swine?
Dad...
Look, you get back inside, Sylvia.
They always want the women.
No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God!
Look at the sky!
That's impossible.
That's just impossible.
It can't be, Right, now we're in trouble.
(COCKING GUN) And it's only just beginning.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) But if the Earth's been moved, they've lost the Sun.
What about my mum? And Granddad?
They're dead!
Are they dead?
I don't know, Donna. I just don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know.
That's my family. My whole world.
There's no readings. Nothing.
Not a trace.
Not even a whisper. Oh, that is fearsome technology.
So what do we do?
We've got to get help.
From where?
Donna, I'm taking you to the Shadow Proclamation.
Hold tight.
The United Nations have issued an edict asking the citizens of the world not to panic.
So far there has been no explanation of the 26 planets which have appeared in the sky.
But it's an empirical fact.
The planets didn't come to us, we came to them.
Just look at the stars.
We're in a completely different region of space. We've travelled.
Do you know what? I look up and there's all these moons and things...
Have you seen them? Do you see them?
What was I drinking last night? Furniture polish?
Ianto. Time and a place.
Yeah, it’s funny, though.
Gwen, come and see.
Rhys, I have no idea. Just stay indoors.
Can you phone my mother? Tell her...
Oh, I don't know. Just tell her to take her pills and go to sleep.
I'm gonna come home as soon as I can.
I promise.
I love you, you big idiot.
JACK: Someone's established an artificial atmospheric shell, keeping the air and holding in the heat.
Ianto: Whoever's done this wants the human race alive.
That's a plus.
Twenty-seven planets, including the Earth.
No, but what's that?
That's not a planet!
MR SMITH: The reading seems to be artificial in construction.
Some sort of space station, sitting at the heart of the web.
They're fine. Maria and her dad, they're still in Cornwall.
I told them to stay indoors. Clyde's all right, he's with his mum.
Sarah Jane, I have detected movement. Observe.
Spaceships.
Tracking 200 objects. Earthbound trajectory.
Geneva is calling a Code Red.
Everyone to battle positions.
Dr Jones, if you're not too busy...
I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.
And?
There's no signal. This number calls anywhere in the universe.
It never breaks down. They must be blocking it.
Whoever they are.
We're about to find out. They're coming into orbit.
I'll take you on! Yeah, you, mate!
(PEOPLE SHOUTING) The end of the world, darling.
End of the stinking world.
Have one on me, mate.
(GLASS BREAKING) (CAR ALARM BLARING) Right. You two, you can put that stuff down or run for your lives.
Do you like my gun?
We're now getting confirmed reports of spaceships.
The Pentagon has issued an emergency report.
Dad, come and see.
They're saying spaceships.
Did you find her?
No.
No, there's no reply.
Where are you, Donna?
ANNOUNCER: ... and stay indoors.
Where are you, sweetheart?
3,000 miles and closing. But who are they?
(PHONE RINGING) Martha Jones, voice of a nightingale. Tell me you put something in my drink.
No such luck. Have you heard from the Doctor?
Not a word. Where are you?
New York.
Oh. Nice for some. I've been promoted.
Medical Director on Project Indigo.
Did you get that thing working?
Indigo's top secret. No one's supposed to know about it.
I met a soldier in a bar. Long story.
When was that?
Strictly professional.
1,500 miles, boys. And accelerating. They're almost here.
I'm receiving a communication from the Earthbound ships.
They have a message for the human race.
Put it through. Let’s hear it.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
No.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Oh, no.
Exterminate!
What is it? Who are they? Do you know her, Jack?
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
No.
Exterminate!
There's nothing I can do.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
I'm sorry. We're dead.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Oh, God, you're so young.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Get out of here! Come on!
This way. Come on!
(PEOPLE SHOUTING) Dalek fleet in battle formation.
All systems locked and primed.
Crucible at 90% efficiency.
The human harvest will commence.
Battle stations!
Geneva declaring ultimate Code Red.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.
Supreme Dalek on the bridge.
SUPREME DALEK: Soon the crucible will be complete.
We have waited long for this ultimate destiny.
Now the Daleks are the masters of Earth.
ALL: Daleks are the masters of Earth!
Daleks are the masters of Earth!
So, go on, then. What is the Shadow Proclamation anyway?
Posh name for police. Outer-space police. Here we go!
Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo to do.
No bo ho sho ko ro to so.
Bo-ko-do-z0-go-bo-fo-po-jo.
Mo ho.
Time Lords are the stuff of legend.
Belong in the myths and whispers of the higher species.
You cannot possibly exist.
Yeah. More to the point, I've got a missing planet.
Then you're not as wise as the stories would say.
The picture is far bigger than you imagine.
The whole universe is in outrage, Doctor.
Twenty-four worlds have been taken from the sky.
How many?
Which ones? Show me!
Locations range far and wide.
They all disappeared at the exact same moment, leaving no trace.
Callufrax Minor. Jahoo. Shallacatop. Woman Wept.
Clom! Clom's gone! Who'd want Clom?
All different sizes, Some populated, some not. But all unconnected.
What about Pyrovillia?
Who is the female?
Donna. I'm a human being. Maybe not the stuff of legend, but every bit as important as Time Lords, thank you.
Way back, when we were in Pompeii, Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.
Pyrovillia is cold case. Not relevant.
How do you mean, cold case?
The planet Pyrovillia cannot be part of this.
It disappeared over 2,000 years ago.
Yes, yes, hang on.
But there's the Adipose Breeding Planet, too.
Miss Foster said that was lost. But that must have been a long time ago.
That's it! Donna, brilliant!
Planets have been taken out of time as well as space.
Put this into 3D.
Now, if we add Pyrovillia and Adipose III.
Something missing. Where else, where else, where else?
Lost, lost, lost, lost. Oh! The lost moon of Poosh!
What did you do?
Nothing.
The planets rearranged themselves into the optimum pattern. Ooh.
Look at that.
Twenty-seven planets in perfect balance.
Come on, that is gorgeous.
Oi, don't get all spaceman. What does it mean?
All those worlds fit together like pieces of an engine.
It's like a powerhouse.
What for?
Who could design such a thing?
Someone tried to move the Earth once before.
Long time ago.
It can't be, DALEK: Maximum extermination!
MAN: The shields are down! There's too many of them! Abandon ship!
The Vatiant’s down!
Air force retreating over North Africa. Daleks landing in Japan.
GWEN: We've lost contact with the Prime Minister's plane.
Jack! Manhattan!
Martha, get out of there.
I can't, Jack. I've got a job to do.
They're targeting military bases, and you're next on the list.
Dr Jones, you will come with me.
Project Indigo is being activated.
Quick march.
But we can't use Project Indigo.
It hasn't been tested, sir. We don't even know if it works, DALEK: Human forces will be exterminated!
Annihilate UNIT!
Exterminate!
Put it on. Fast as you can!
Martha, I'm telling you. Don't use Project Indigo. It's not safe!
You take your orders from UNIT, Dr Jones, not from Torchwood.
But why me?
You're our only hope of finding the Doctor. But failing that, if no help is coming, then with the power invested in me by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce I authorise you to take this.
The Osterhagen Key.
I can't take that, sir.
You know what to do!
For the sake of the human race.
(EXPLOSION) DALEK: Dalek Attack Squad Five reaching north corridor.
Dr Jones.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Good luck.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Bye, Jack.
Martha, don't do it!
Don't!
What's Project Indigo?
MAN: UNIT base...
Experimental teleport salvaged from the Sontarans.
But they haven't got coordinates or stabilisation!
So where is she?
Scattered into atoms, Martha's down.
Commence the landings.
Bring the humans here.
Prepare the crucible.
VOICE: Supreme Dalek, is there news?
SUPREME DALEK: Earth has been subjugated.
VOICE: I mean, is there news of him?
SUPREME DALEK: Negative. No reports of Time Lord.
We are beyond the Doctor's reach.
VOICE: Fascinating.
If I had not elevated you beyond crude emotions, I could almost mistake that tone for one of victory.
Beware your pride, SUPREME DALEK: The Doctor cannot stop us.
VOICE: And yet Dalek Caan is uneasy.
SUPREME DALEK: The abomination is insane!
VOICE: Show respect. Without Dalek Caan none of this would be possible.
And he speaks only the truth.
DALEK CAAN: He is coming.
The three-fold man, he dances in the lonely places.
Oh, creator of us all, the Doctor is coming!
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (HEART BEATING) You need sustenance.
Take the water. It purifies.
Thanks.
There was something on your back.
How did you know that?
You are something new.
Not me.
I'm just a temp. Shorthand, filing, 100 words per minute.
Fat lot of good that is now. I'm no use to anyone.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Yeah.
My whole planet's gone.
I mean the loss that is yet to come.
God save you.
Donna, think, Earth. There must have been some sort of warning.
Was anything happening back in your day, like electrical storms, freak weather, patterns in the sky?
Well, how should I know?
Erm, no. I don't think so. No.
Okay, never mind.
Although...
There were the bees disappearing.
The bees disappearing?
The bees disappearing.
The bees disappearing!
How is that significant?
On Earth, we have these insects.
Some people said it was pollution or mobile phone signals.
Or they were going back home.
Back home where?
Planet Melissa Majoria.
Are you saying bees are aliens?
Don't be so daft. Not all of them.
But if the migrant bees felt something coming, some danger, and escaped...
Tandocca!
The Tandocca Scale, The Tandocca Scale is a series of wavelengths used as carrier signals by migrant bees.
Infinitely small. No wonder we didn't see it.
It's like looking for a speck of cinnamon in the Sahara.
Look! There it is! The Tandocca trail!
The transmat that moved the planets was using the same wavelength.
We can follow the path!
DONNA: And find the Earth! Well, stop talking and do it!
DOCTOR: I am!
We're a bit late.
The signal's scattered but it’s a start.
I've got a blip! It's just a blip, but it's definitely a blip.
Then according to the strictures of the Shadow Proclamation, I will have to seize your transport and your technology.
Oh, really? What for?
The planets were stolen with hostile intent.
We are declaring war, Doctor.
Right across the universe. And you will lead us into battle!
Right. Yes.
Of course I will.
I'll just go and get you the key.
(WHOOSHING) Doctor, come back!
By the holy writ of the Shadow Proclamation, I order you to stop!
All humans will leave their homes.
All humans will leave their homes.
The males, the females, the descendents, you will come with us!
Resistance is useless.
Where are you taking us?
Daleks do not answer human questions.
Stand in line!
Dad, please, come home.
They're leaving our street alone.
I've got a weapon.
It's a paint gun.
Exactly.
Them Dalek things, they've only got one eye.
A good splodge of paint, they'd be blinded.
We're not going! Do you hear me?
Laura, get back inside the house.
Simon, get inside! Go!
Get back in the sky!
Get back where you came from and leave us alone!
Dalek attack formation seven.
Maximum extermination!
They're monsters.
Please, Dad, come on.
Halt! You will come with me.
Will I heck!
My vision is not impaired!
I warned you, Dad.
Hostility will not be tolerated! Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exter...
Do you wanna swap?
You're Donna Noble's family, right?
I'm Rose Tyler. And I need you.
Yeah, I've tried calling her, but I can’t get through.
But she's still with the Doctor.
I know that much. And the last time she phoned, it was from a planet called Midnight, made of diamonds.
What the hell are you two on about?
Look, she's out there, sweetheart.
Your daughter.
She's travelling the stars with that Doctor.
She always has been.
Don't be ridiculous, Oh, come on, open your eyes. Look at the sky.
Look at... Look at the Daleks. You can’t start denying things now.
You were my last hope.
If we can't find Donna, we can't find the Doctor.
Where is he?
(THUMPING) It's stopped.
What do you mean?
Is that good or bad? Where are we?
The Medusa Cascade.
I came here when I was just a kid, 90 years old.
It was the centre of a rift in time and space.
So, where are the 27 planets?
Nowhere.
The Tandocca trail stops dead.
End of the line.
So what do we do?
Doctor, what do we do?
Now, don't do this to me.
No, don't.
Don't do this to me.
Not now.
Tell me what are we going to do.
You never give up.
Please!
This is the Commander General of the United Nations calling the Dalek fleet.
We surrender, Repeat, we surrender.
Planet Earth surrenders.
DALEK: ... humans selected for testing will follow Dalek instructions.
The Daleks reign supreme.
All hail the Daleks!
You will obey Dalek instructions without question.
You will obey your Dalek.
(TRANSMISSION SPUTTERING) WOMAN: Can anyone hear me?
The Subwave Network is open. You should be able to hear my voice.
Is there anyone there?
I know that voice.
Who's that?
Some poor soul calling for help.
There's nothing we can do.
But look at Mr Smith.
MR SMITH: Processing incoming Subwave.
WOMAN: This message is of the utmost importance.
We haven't much time.
Can anyone hear me?
Someone's trying to get in touch.
The whole world's crying out. Just leave it.
Captain Jack Harkness, shame on you!
Now, stand to attention, sir.
What?
Who is that?
Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.
Yeah, I know who you are.
Harriet, it's me! It's me! She can't hear me.
Have you got a webcam?
No, she wouldn't let me. She said they're naughty.
I can't speak to her then, can 1?
Sarah Jane Smith, 13 Bannerman Road, are you there?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here. That's me!
Good!
Now, let's see if we can talk to each other.
The fourth contact seems to be having some trouble getting through.
That's me! Harriet, that's me!
I'll just boost the signal.
Hello?
Martha Jones!
Who's she? I want to get through.
Martha, where are you?
I guess Project Indigo was more clever than we thought.
One second I was in Manhattan...
Next second, maybe Indigo tapped into my mind ‘cause I ended up in the one place I wanted to be.
Mum?
You came home.
At the end of the world, you came back to me.
But then all of a sudden, it's like the laptop turned itself on.
It did. That was me.
Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.
Yes, I know who you are.
I thought it was about time we all met given the current crisis.
Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith.
I've been following your work. Nice job with the Slitheen.
Yeah, well, I've been staying away from you lot.
Too many guns.
All the same, might I say, looking good, ma'am?
Really? Ooh!
Not now, Captain.
And Martha Jones, former companion to the Doctor.
Oi, so was I!
But how did you find me?
This, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Subwave Network.
A sentient piece of software programmed to seek out anyone and everyone who can help to contact the Doctor.
What if the Daleks can here us?
No.
That's the beauty of the Subwave. It's undetectable.
And you invented it?
I developed it.
It was created by the Mr Copper Foundation.
Yeah, but what we need right now is a weapon.
Martha, back at UNIT, what did they give you?
What was that key thing?
The Osterhagen Key.
That key is not to be used, Dr Jones.
Not under any circumstances.
But what is an Osterhagen Key?
Forget about the key! And that's an order!
HARRIET: All we need is the Doctor.
Oh, excuse me, Harriet, but well, the thing is, if you're looking for the Doctor, didn’t he depose you?
He did.
And I've wondered about that for a long time, whether I was wrong.
But I stand by my actions to this day because I knew... I knew that one day, the Earth would be in danger.
And the Doctor would fail to appear.
I told him so myself, and he didn't listen.
But I've been trying to find him.
The Doctor's got my phone on the Tardis, but I can't get through.
Nor me. And I was here first.
That's why we need the Subwave. To bring us all together.
Combine forces. The Doctor's secret army.
Wait a minute. We boost the signal, that's it.
We transmit that telephone number through Torchwood itself, ~using all the power of the rift...
And we've got Mr Smith.
He can link up with every telephone exchange on the Earth, He can get the whole world to call the same number all at the same time.
Billions of phones calling out all at once!
Brilliant! Who's the kid?
That's my son.
Excuse me, sorry.
Sorry, hello. Ianto Jones.
If we start transmitting, then this Subwave Network is going to become visible, I mean, to the Daleks.
Yes, and they'll trace it back to me.
But my life doesn't matter.
Not if it saves the Earth.
Ma’am.
Thank you, Captain.
But there are people out there dying on the streets.
Marvellous woman. I voted for her.
You did not!
Now, enough of words, let's begin.
Grid power activated.
All terminals coordinated.
National Grid online, giving you everything we've got.
Connecting you to Mr Smith.
All telephone networks combined.
Sending you the number now.
(PHONE DIALLING) Opening Subwave Network to maximum.
Mr Smith?
Make that call.
MR SMITH: Calling the Doctor.
So am I.
And sending!
(PHONE RINGING) Phone!
Phone!
Martha, is that you?
It's just a signal.
Can we follow it?
Just watch me.
Emergency! Unknown network detected! Subwave frequency!
SUPREME DALEK: Find the point of origin. Find and exterminate!
VOICE: I warned you, Supreme One.
Just as Dalek Caan foretold.
The children of time are moving against us.
But everything is falling into place.
I think we got a fix!
Mr Smith now at 200%.
Come on, Doctor!
(WHISPERING) Find me, Doctor.
Find me.
Got it! Locking on.
Harriet, a source's locked onto your location.
They found you.
I know. I'm using the network to mask your transmission. Keep going.
Exterminate!
DOCTOR: We're travelling through time.
One second in the future. The phone call's pulling us through.
Captain, I'm transferring the Subwave Network to Torchwood.
You're in charge now.
And tell the Doctor from me, he chose his companions well.
It's been an honour.
(EXPLOSION) Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.
Yas, we know who you are!
Oh, you know nothing of any human.
And that will be your downfall.
Exterminate!
Three, two, one!
(BOTH YELLING) Twenty-seven planets.
And there's the Earth.
But why couldn't we see them?
The entire Medusa Cascade has been put a second out of sync with the rest of universe, Perfect hiding place. Tiny little pocket of time, but we found them!
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh, what's that?
Hold on, hold on.
Some sort of Subwave Network.
Where the hell have you been? Doctor, it's the Daleks!
Oh, he's a bit nice, I thought he'd be older.
He's not that young.
SARAH JANE: It's the Daleks, they're taking people to their spaceship...
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE) . It's not just Dalek Caan!
That's Donna!
That's my girl!
Sarah Jane! Who's that boy?
That must be Torchwood.
Aren't they brilliant? Look at you all, you clever people.
That's Martha. And who's he?
Captain Jack. Don't. Just...
Don't.
Doctor, it's me.
I came back.
DONNA: It's like an outer space Facebook.
Everyone except Rose.
(LAUGHING) DALEK CAAN: He is here, The Dark Lord is come!
Supreme One, this Subwave Network, I will address it. Give me access, We've lost them.
No, no, no, no.
There's another signal coming through. There's someone else out there.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Rose.
Your voice is different and yet its arrogance is unchanged.
No.
But he's dead.
Welcome to my new empire, Doctor.
It is only fitting that you should bear witness to the resurrection and the triumph of Davros, lord and creator of the Dalek race.
Doctor.
DAVROS: Have you nothing to say?
Doctor, it's all right.
We're in the Tardis, We're safe.
But you were destroyed.
In the very first year of the Time War at the Gates of Elysium.
I saw your command ship fly into the jaws of the Nightmare Child.
I tried to save you.
But it took one stronger than you.
Dalek Caan himself.
DALEK CAAN: I flew into the wild and fire.
I danced and died a thousand times.
Emergency temporal shift took him back into the Time War itself.
But that's impossible! The entire war is time-locked!
And yet he succeeded.
Oh, it cost him his mind, but imagine, a single simple Dalek succeeded where emperors and Time Lords have failed.
A testament, don't you think, to my remarkable creations?
And you made a new race of Daleks.
I gave myself to them.
Quite literally.
Each one grown from a cell of my own body.
New Daleks. True Daleks.
I have my children, Doctor.
What do you have now?
After all this time, everything we saw, everything we lost, I have only one thing to say to you.
Bye!
SUPREME DALEK: Emergency! Locate the Tardis! Find the Doctor!
He will go to the Earth to find his precious human allies.
DALEK CAAN: And death is coming.
Oh, I can see it.
Everlasting death for the most faithful companion.
DALEK: Subwave Network rerouted! New location, Torchwood!
SUPREME DALEK: Then exterminate them at once!
Exterminate Torchwood!
(ALARM BLARING) Gwen.
Dalek saucer heading for the Bay. They've found us.
Martha, open that Indigo device. Listen to me.
Lift the central panel, there's a string of numbers that keep changing.
But the fourth number keeps oscillating between two different digits.
Tell me what they are.
It's a four and a nine.
We could never work out what that was.
Yeah! That's a teleport base code.
And that's all I need to get this thing working again.
Oscillating four and nine.
Thank you, Martha Jones.
I gotta go. I gotta find the Doctor.
I'll come back.
I'm coming back.
Don't worry about us. Just go.
We'll be fine.
JACK: You'd better be.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
They're here.
MR SMITH: Tardis heading for vector 7. Grid reference 6-6...
There are Daleks out there.
I know.
I'm sorry, but I have got to find the Doctor.
Don't move, don't leave the house, don't do anything.
MR SMITH: I will protect the boy, Sarah Jane.
I love you.
Remember that.
Control, I need another shift. Lock me onto the Tardis. Now.
Right, I'm gonna find him.
Wish me luck.
Oh, good luck!
Yeah, good luck, sweetheart.
It's like a ghost town.
DOCTOR: Sarah Jane said they were taking the people.
What for? Think, Donna.
When you met Rose in that parallel world, what did she say?
Just, “The darkness is coming." Anything else?
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Exterminate!
I've got you. It missed you. Look, it's me, Doctor.
Rose.
Right.
(GASPING) Long time no see. “Yeah.
Been busy, you know.
Don't die. No, don't die.
My God, don't die.
Get him into the Tardis, quick. Move!
But they don’t work against Daleks.
Yeah? Well, I'm going out fighting. Like Owen, like Tosh. How about you?
Exterminate!
Yes, ma'am!
Exterminate!
DONNA: What do we do?
There must be some medicine, or something.
Just step back. Rose, do as I say and get back!
He's dying. And you know what happens next.
What do you mean?
He can't.
Not now. I came all this way.
What do you mean? What happens next?
It's starting.
(TYRES SCREECHING) All human transport is forbidden!
I surrender! I'm sorry!
Daleks do not accept apologies! You will be exterminated!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
(SHOUTING) JACK: Here we go. Good luck, Doctor!
DONNA: Will someone please tell me what is going on?
When he's dying, his body, it repairs itself. It changes.
But you can't!
I'm sorry, it’s too late.
I'm regenerating.  @@@@@@
@@@@@@
It's fine.
Everything's fine.
Nothing's wrong. It's all fine.
Excuse me, what day is it?
Saturday.
Saturday. Good.
Good. I like Saturdays.
So I just met Rose Tyler?
Yeah.
But she's locked away in a parallel world.
Exactly. If she can cross from her parallel world to your parallel world then that means the walls of the universe are breaking down, which puts everything in danger. Everything.
But how?
Thing is, Doctor, no matter what's happening, and I'm sure it's bad, I get that.
But Rose is coming back.
Isn't that good?
Yeah.
(EXPLOSION) What the hell was that?
Don't know. It came from outside.
But we're in space.
How did it happen?
What did you do?
We haven't moved. We're fixed.
It can't have. No!
Tardis is still in the same place, but the Earth has gone.
The entire planet!
It's gone.
MAN: Give me a cigarette. Right now. Confirm all stations still online.
Can anyone hear me? Have we got contact with UNIT base...
What was that?
WOMAN: Emergency systems online.
Was it some sort of earthquake or...
WOMAN: Get the system operational...
Jalandra, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Is anyone hurt?
MARTHA: We've lost power. Someone get the lights back on.
DaCosta, see to it right now.
Suzanne, are you okay?
Martha, look at the sky.
Why, what is it?
Just look at the sky!
Whoa, what happened?
Is it the rift? Gwen, Ianto, you okay?
No broken bones. Slight loss of dignity. No change there, then.
The whole of the city must've felt that. The whole of South Wales.
I'm gonna take a look outside.
A little bit bigger than South Wales.
Luke, are you all right?
It felt like some sort of cross-dimensional spatial transference.
But it's night. It wasn't night. It was 8:00 in the morning!
Mr Smith, I need you!
I wish you'd stop giving that fanfare and just tell me what happened!
Sarah Jane, I think you should look outside, I'll think you'll find the visual evidence most conclusive.
It's gone dark. It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension.
What do you want this time, you green swine?
Dad...
Look, you get back inside, Sylvia.
They always want the women.
No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God!
Look at the sky!
That's impossible.
That's just impossible.
It can't be, Right, now we're in trouble.
(COCKING GUN) And it's only just beginning.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME) But if the Earth's been moved, they've lost the Sun.
What about my mum? And Granddad?
They're dead!
Are they dead?
I don't know, Donna. I just don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know.
That's my family. My whole world.
There's no readings. Nothing.
Not a trace.
Not even a whisper. Oh, that is fearsome technology.
So what do we do?
We've got to get help.
From where?
Donna, I'm taking you to the Shadow Proclamation.
Hold tight.
The United Nations have issued an edict asking the citizens of the world not to panic.
So far there has been no explanation of the 26 planets which have appeared in the sky.
But it's an empirical fact.
The planets didn't come to us, we came to them.
Just look at the stars.
We're in a completely different region of space. We've travelled.
Do you know what? I look up and there's all these moons and things...
Have you seen them? Do you see them?
What was I drinking last night? Furniture polish?
Ianto. Time and a place.
Yeah, it’s funny, though.
Gwen, come and see.
Rhys, I have no idea. Just stay indoors.
Can you phone my mother? Tell her...
Oh, I don't know. Just tell her to take her pills and go to sleep.
I'm gonna come home as soon as I can.
I promise.
I love you, you big idiot.
JACK: Someone's established an artificial atmospheric shell, keeping the air and holding in the heat.
Ianto: Whoever's done this wants the human race alive.
That's a plus.
Twenty-seven planets, including the Earth.
No, but what's that?
That's not a planet!
MR SMITH: The reading seems to be artificial in construction.
Some sort of space station, sitting at the heart of the web.
They're fine. Maria and her dad, they're still in Cornwall.
I told them to stay indoors. Clyde's all right, he's with his mum.
Sarah Jane, I have detected movement. Observe.
Spaceships.
Tracking 200 objects. Earthbound trajectory.
Geneva is calling a Code Red.
Everyone to battle positions.
Dr Jones, if you're not too busy...
I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.
And?
There's no signal. This number calls anywhere in the universe.
It never breaks down. They must be blocking it.
Whoever they are.
We're about to find out. They're coming into orbit.
I'll take you on! Yeah, you, mate!
(PEOPLE SHOUTING) The end of the world, darling.
End of the stinking world.
Have one on me, mate.
(GLASS BREAKING) (CAR ALARM BLARING) Right. You two, you can put that stuff down or run for your lives.
Do you like my gun?
We're now getting confirmed reports of spaceships.
The Pentagon has issued an emergency report.
Dad, come and see.
They're saying spaceships.
Did you find her?
No.
No, there's no reply.
Where are you, Donna?
ANNOUNCER: ... and stay indoors.
Where are you, sweetheart?
3,000 miles and closing. But who are they?
(PHONE RINGING) Martha Jones, voice of a nightingale. Tell me you put something in my drink.
No such luck. Have you heard from the Doctor?
Not a word. Where are you?
New York.
Oh. Nice for some. I've been promoted.
Medical Director on Project Indigo.
Did you get that thing working?
Indigo's top secret. No one's supposed to know about it.
I met a soldier in a bar. Long story.
When was that?
Strictly professional.
1,500 miles, boys. And accelerating. They're almost here.
I'm receiving a communication from the Earthbound ships.
They have a message for the human race.
Put it through. Let’s hear it.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
No.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Oh, no.
Exterminate!
What is it? Who are they? Do you know her, Jack?
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
No.
Exterminate!
There's nothing I can do.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
I'm sorry. We're dead.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Oh, God, you're so young.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Get out of here! Come on!
This way. Come on!
(PEOPLE SHOUTING) Dalek fleet in battle formation.
All systems locked and primed.
Crucible at 90% efficiency.
The human harvest will commence.
Battle stations!
Geneva declaring ultimate Code Red.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.
Supreme Dalek on the bridge.
SUPREME DALEK: Soon the crucible will be complete.
We have waited long for this ultimate destiny.
Now the Daleks are the masters of Earth.
ALL: Daleks are the masters of Earth!
Daleks are the masters of Earth!
So, go on, then. What is the Shadow Proclamation anyway?
Posh name for police. Outer-space police. Here we go!
Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo to do.
No bo ho sho ko ro to so.
Bo-ko-do-z0-go-bo-fo-po-jo.
Mo ho.
Time Lords are the stuff of legend.
Belong in the myths and whispers of the higher species.
You cannot possibly exist.
Yeah. More to the point, I've got a missing planet.
Then you're not as wise as the stories would say.
The picture is far bigger than you imagine.
The whole universe is in outrage, Doctor.
Twenty-four worlds have been taken from the sky.
How many?
Which ones? Show me!
Locations range far and wide.
They all disappeared at the exact same moment, leaving no trace.
Callufrax Minor. Jahoo. Shallacatop. Woman Wept.
Clom! Clom's gone! Who'd want Clom?
All different sizes, Some populated, some not. But all unconnected.
What about Pyrovillia?
Who is the female?
Donna. I'm a human being. Maybe not the stuff of legend, but every bit as important as Time Lords, thank you.
Way back, when we were in Pompeii, Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.
Pyrovillia is cold case. Not relevant.
How do you mean, cold case?
The planet Pyrovillia cannot be part of this.
It disappeared over 2,000 years ago.
Yes, yes, hang on.
But there's the Adipose Breeding Planet, too.
Miss Foster said that was lost. But that must have been a long time ago.
That's it! Donna, brilliant!
Planets have been taken out of time as well as space.
Put this into 3D.
Now, if we add Pyrovillia and Adipose III.
Something missing. Where else, where else, where else?
Lost, lost, lost, lost. Oh! The lost moon of Poosh!
What did you do?
Nothing.
The planets rearranged themselves into the optimum pattern. Ooh.
Look at that.
Twenty-seven planets in perfect balance.
Come on, that is gorgeous.
Oi, don't get all spaceman. What does it mean?
All those worlds fit together like pieces of an engine.
It's like a powerhouse.
What for?
Who could design such a thing?
Someone tried to move the Earth once before.
Long time ago.
It can't be, DALEK: Maximum extermination!
MAN: The shields are down! There's too many of them! Abandon ship!
The Vatiant’s down!
Air force retreating over North Africa. Daleks landing in Japan.
GWEN: We've lost contact with the Prime Minister's plane.
Jack! Manhattan!
Martha, get out of there.
I can't, Jack. I've got a job to do.
They're targeting military bases, and you're next on the list.
Dr Jones, you will come with me.
Project Indigo is being activated.
Quick march.
But we can't use Project Indigo.
It hasn't been tested, sir. We don't even know if it works, DALEK: Human forces will be exterminated!
Annihilate UNIT!
Exterminate!
Put it on. Fast as you can!
Martha, I'm telling you. Don't use Project Indigo. It's not safe!
You take your orders from UNIT, Dr Jones, not from Torchwood.
But why me?
You're our only hope of finding the Doctor. But failing that, if no help is coming, then with the power invested in me by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce I authorise you to take this.
The Osterhagen Key.
I can't take that, sir.
You know what to do!
For the sake of the human race.
(EXPLOSION) DALEK: Dalek Attack Squad Five reaching north corridor.
Dr Jones.
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Good luck.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Bye, Jack.
Martha, don't do it!
Don't!
What's Project Indigo?
MAN: UNIT base...
Experimental teleport salvaged from the Sontarans.
But they haven't got coordinates or stabilisation!
So where is she?
Scattered into atoms, Martha's down.
Commence the landings.
Bring the humans here.
Prepare the crucible.
VOICE: Supreme Dalek, is there news?
SUPREME DALEK: Earth has been subjugated.
VOICE: I mean, is there news of him?
SUPREME DALEK: Negative. No reports of Time Lord.
We are beyond the Doctor's reach.
VOICE: Fascinating.
If I had not elevated you beyond crude emotions, I could almost mistake that tone for one of victory.
Beware your pride, SUPREME DALEK: The Doctor cannot stop us.
VOICE: And yet Dalek Caan is uneasy.
SUPREME DALEK: The abomination is insane!
VOICE: Show respect. Without Dalek Caan none of this would be possible.
And he speaks only the truth.
DALEK CAAN: He is coming.
The three-fold man, he dances in the lonely places.
Oh, creator of us all, the Doctor is coming!
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (HEART BEATING) You need sustenance.
Take the water. It purifies.
Thanks.
There was something on your back.
How did you know that?
You are something new.
Not me.
I'm just a temp. Shorthand, filing, 100 words per minute.
Fat lot of good that is now. I'm no use to anyone.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Yeah.
My whole planet's gone.
I mean the loss that is yet to come.
God save you.
Donna, think, Earth. There must have been some sort of warning.
Was anything happening back in your day, like electrical storms, freak weather, patterns in the sky?
Well, how should I know?
Erm, no. I don't think so. No.
Okay, never mind.
Although...
There were the bees disappearing.
The bees disappearing?
The bees disappearing.
The bees disappearing!
How is that significant?
On Earth, we have these insects.
Some people said it was pollution or mobile phone signals.
Or they were going back home.
Back home where?
Planet Melissa Majoria.
Are you saying bees are aliens?
Don't be so daft. Not all of them.
But if the migrant bees felt something coming, some danger, and escaped...
Tandocca!
The Tandocca Scale, The Tandocca Scale is a series of wavelengths used as carrier signals by migrant bees.
Infinitely small. No wonder we didn't see it.
It's like looking for a speck of cinnamon in the Sahara.
Look! There it is! The Tandocca trail!
The transmat that moved the planets was using the same wavelength.
We can follow the path!
DONNA: And find the Earth! Well, stop talking and do it!
DOCTOR: I am!
We're a bit late.
The signal's scattered but it’s a start.
I've got a blip! It's just a blip, but it's definitely a blip.
Then according to the strictures of the Shadow Proclamation, I will have to seize your transport and your technology.
Oh, really? What for?
The planets were stolen with hostile intent.
We are declaring war, Doctor.
Right across the universe. And you will lead us into battle!
Right. Yes.
Of course I will.
I'll just go and get you the key.
(WHOOSHING) Doctor, come back!
By the holy writ of the Shadow Proclamation, I order you to stop!
All humans will leave their homes.
All humans will leave their homes.
The males, the females, the descendents, you will come with us!
Resistance is useless.
Where are you taking us?
Daleks do not answer human questions.
Stand in line!
Dad, please, come home.
They're leaving our street alone.
I've got a weapon.
It's a paint gun.
Exactly.
Them Dalek things, they've only got one eye.
A good splodge of paint, they'd be blinded.
We're not going! Do you hear me?
Laura, get back inside the house.
Simon, get inside! Go!
Get back in the sky!
Get back where you came from and leave us alone!
Dalek attack formation seven.
Maximum extermination!
They're monsters.
Please, Dad, come on.
Halt! You will come with me.
Will I heck!
My vision is not impaired!
I warned you, Dad.
Hostility will not be tolerated! Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exter...
Do you wanna swap?
You're Donna Noble's family, right?
I'm Rose Tyler. And I need you.
Yeah, I've tried calling her, but I can’t get through.
But she's still with the Doctor.
I know that much. And the last time she phoned, it was from a planet called Midnight, made of diamonds.
What the hell are you two on about?
Look, she's out there, sweetheart.
Your daughter.
She's travelling the stars with that Doctor.
She always has been.
Don't be ridiculous, Oh, come on, open your eyes. Look at the sky.
Look at... Look at the Daleks. You can’t start denying things now.
You were my last hope.
If we can't find Donna, we can't find the Doctor.
Where is he?
(THUMPING) It's stopped.
What do you mean?
Is that good or bad? Where are we?
The Medusa Cascade.
I came here when I was just a kid, 90 years old.
It was the centre of a rift in time and space.
So, where are the 27 planets?
Nowhere.
The Tandocca trail stops dead.
End of the line.
So what do we do?
Doctor, what do we do?
Now, don't do this to me.
No, don't.
Don't do this to me.
Not now.
Tell me what are we going to do.
You never give up.
Please!
This is the Commander General of the United Nations calling the Dalek fleet.
We surrender, Repeat, we surrender.
Planet Earth surrenders.
DALEK: ... humans selected for testing will follow Dalek instructions.
The Daleks reign supreme.
All hail the Daleks!
You will obey Dalek instructions without question.
You will obey your Dalek.
(TRANSMISSION SPUTTERING) WOMAN: Can anyone hear me?
The Subwave Network is open. You should be able to hear my voice.
Is there anyone there?
I know that voice.
Who's that?
Some poor soul calling for help.
There's nothing we can do.
But look at Mr Smith.
MR SMITH: Processing incoming Subwave.
WOMAN: This message is of the utmost importance.
We haven't much time.
Can anyone hear me?
Someone's trying to get in touch.
The whole world's crying out. Just leave it.
Captain Jack Harkness, shame on you!
Now, stand to attention, sir.
What?
Who is that?
Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.
Yeah, I know who you are.
Harriet, it's me! It's me! She can't hear me.
Have you got a webcam?
No, she wouldn't let me. She said they're naughty.
I can't speak to her then, can 1?
Sarah Jane Smith, 13 Bannerman Road, are you there?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here. That's me!
Good!
Now, let's see if we can talk to each other.
The fourth contact seems to be having some trouble getting through.
That's me! Harriet, that's me!
I'll just boost the signal.
Hello?
Martha Jones!
Who's she? I want to get through.
Martha, where are you?
I guess Project Indigo was more clever than we thought.
One second I was in Manhattan...
Next second, maybe Indigo tapped into my mind ‘cause I ended up in the one place I wanted to be.
Mum?
You came home.
At the end of the world, you came back to me.
But then all of a sudden, it's like the laptop turned itself on.
It did. That was me.
Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.
Yes, I know who you are.
I thought it was about time we all met given the current crisis.
Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith.
I've been following your work. Nice job with the Slitheen.
Yeah, well, I've been staying away from you lot.
Too many guns.
All the same, might I say, looking good, ma'am?
Really? Ooh!
Not now, Captain.
And Martha Jones, former companion to the Doctor.
Oi, so was I!
But how did you find me?
This, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Subwave Network.
A sentient piece of software programmed to seek out anyone and everyone who can help to contact the Doctor.
What if the Daleks can here us?
No.
That's the beauty of the Subwave. It's undetectable.
And you invented it?
I developed it.
It was created by the Mr Copper Foundation.
Yeah, but what we need right now is a weapon.
Martha, back at UNIT, what did they give you?
What was that key thing?
The Osterhagen Key.
That key is not to be used, Dr Jones.
Not under any circumstances.
But what is an Osterhagen Key?
Forget about the key! And that's an order!
HARRIET: All we need is the Doctor.
Oh, excuse me, Harriet, but well, the thing is, if you're looking for the Doctor, didn’t he depose you?
He did.
And I've wondered about that for a long time, whether I was wrong.
But I stand by my actions to this day because I knew... I knew that one day, the Earth would be in danger.
And the Doctor would fail to appear.
I told him so myself, and he didn't listen.
But I've been trying to find him.
The Doctor's got my phone on the Tardis, but I can't get through.
Nor me. And I was here first.
That's why we need the Subwave. To bring us all together.
Combine forces. The Doctor's secret army.
Wait a minute. We boost the signal, that's it.
We transmit that telephone number through Torchwood itself, ~using all the power of the rift...
And we've got Mr Smith.
He can link up with every telephone exchange on the Earth, He can get the whole world to call the same number all at the same time.
Billions of phones calling out all at once!
Brilliant! Who's the kid?
That's my son.
Excuse me, sorry.
Sorry, hello. Ianto Jones.
If we start transmitting, then this Subwave Network is going to become visible, I mean, to the Daleks.
Yes, and they'll trace it back to me.
But my life doesn't matter.
Not if it saves the Earth.
Ma’am.
Thank you, Captain.
But there are people out there dying on the streets.
Marvellous woman. I voted for her.
You did not!
Now, enough of words, let's begin.
Grid power activated.
All terminals coordinated.
National Grid online, giving you everything we've got.
Connecting you to Mr Smith.
All telephone networks combined.
Sending you the number now.
(PHONE DIALLING) Opening Subwave Network to maximum.
Mr Smith?
Make that call.
MR SMITH: Calling the Doctor.
So am I.
And sending!
(PHONE RINGING) Phone!
Phone!
Martha, is that you?
It's just a signal.
Can we follow it?
Just watch me.
Emergency! Unknown network detected! Subwave frequency!
SUPREME DALEK: Find the point of origin. Find and exterminate!
VOICE: I warned you, Supreme One.
Just as Dalek Caan foretold.
The children of time are moving against us.
But everything is falling into place.
I think we got a fix!
Mr Smith now at 200%.
Come on, Doctor!
(WHISPERING) Find me, Doctor.
Find me.
Got it! Locking on.
Harriet, a source's locked onto your location.
They found you.
I know. I'm using the network to mask your transmission. Keep going.
Exterminate!
DOCTOR: We're travelling through time.
One second in the future. The phone call's pulling us through.
Captain, I'm transferring the Subwave Network to Torchwood.
You're in charge now.
And tell the Doctor from me, he chose his companions well.
It's been an honour.
(EXPLOSION) Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.
Yas, we know who you are!
Oh, you know nothing of any human.
And that will be your downfall.
Exterminate!
Three, two, one!
(BOTH YELLING) Twenty-seven planets.
And there's the Earth.
But why couldn't we see them?
The entire Medusa Cascade has been put a second out of sync with the rest of universe, Perfect hiding place. Tiny little pocket of time, but we found them!
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh, what's that?
Hold on, hold on.
Some sort of Subwave Network.
Where the hell have you been? Doctor, it's the Daleks!
Oh, he's a bit nice, I thought he'd be older.
He's not that young.
SARAH JANE: It's the Daleks, they're taking people to their spaceship...
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE) . It's not just Dalek Caan!
That's Donna!
That's my girl!
Sarah Jane! Who's that boy?
That must be Torchwood.
Aren't they brilliant? Look at you all, you clever people.
That's Martha. And who's he?
Captain Jack. Don't. Just...
Don't.
Doctor, it's me.
I came back.
DONNA: It's like an outer space Facebook.
Everyone except Rose.
(LAUGHING) DALEK CAAN: He is here, The Dark Lord is come!
Supreme One, this Subwave Network, I will address it. Give me access, We've lost them.
No, no, no, no.
There's another signal coming through. There's someone else out there.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Rose.
Your voice is different and yet its arrogance is unchanged.
No.
But he's dead.
Welcome to my new empire, Doctor.
It is only fitting that you should bear witness to the resurrection and the triumph of Davros, lord and creator of the Dalek race.
Doctor.
DAVROS: Have you nothing to say?
Doctor, it's all right.
We're in the Tardis, We're safe.
But you were destroyed.
In the very first year of the Time War at the Gates of Elysium.
I saw your command ship fly into the jaws of the Nightmare Child.
I tried to save you.
But it took one stronger than you.
Dalek Caan himself.
DALEK CAAN: I flew into the wild and fire.
I danced and died a thousand times.
Emergency temporal shift took him back into the Time War itself.
But that's impossible! The entire war is time-locked!
And yet he succeeded.
Oh, it cost him his mind, but imagine, a single simple Dalek succeeded where emperors and Time Lords have failed.
A testament, don't you think, to my remarkable creations?
And you made a new race of Daleks.
I gave myself to them.
Quite literally.
Each one grown from a cell of my own body.
New Daleks. True Daleks.
I have my children, Doctor.
What do you have now?
After all this time, everything we saw, everything we lost, I have only one thing to say to you.
Bye!
SUPREME DALEK: Emergency! Locate the Tardis! Find the Doctor!
He will go to the Earth to find his precious human allies.
DALEK CAAN: And death is coming.
Oh, I can see it.
Everlasting death for the most faithful companion.
DALEK: Subwave Network rerouted! New location, Torchwood!
SUPREME DALEK: Then exterminate them at once!
Exterminate Torchwood!
(ALARM BLARING) Gwen.
Dalek saucer heading for the Bay. They've found us.
Martha, open that Indigo device. Listen to me.
Lift the central panel, there's a string of numbers that keep changing.
But the fourth number keeps oscillating between two different digits.
Tell me what they are.
It's a four and a nine.
We could never work out what that was.
Yeah! That's a teleport base code.
And that's all I need to get this thing working again.
Oscillating four and nine.
Thank you, Martha Jones.
I gotta go. I gotta find the Doctor.
I'll come back.
I'm coming back.
Don't worry about us. Just go.
We'll be fine.
JACK: You'd better be.
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
They're here.
MR SMITH: Tardis heading for vector 7. Grid reference 6-6...
There are Daleks out there.
I know.
I'm sorry, but I have got to find the Doctor.
Don't move, don't leave the house, don't do anything.
MR SMITH: I will protect the boy, Sarah Jane.
I love you.
Remember that.
Control, I need another shift. Lock me onto the Tardis. Now.
Right, I'm gonna find him.
Wish me luck.
Oh, good luck!
Yeah, good luck, sweetheart.
It's like a ghost town.
DOCTOR: Sarah Jane said they were taking the people.
What for? Think, Donna.
When you met Rose in that parallel world, what did she say?
Just, “The darkness is coming." Anything else?
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Exterminate!
I've got you. It missed you. Look, it's me, Doctor.
Rose.
Right.
(GASPING) Long time no see. “Yeah.
Been busy, you know.
Don't die. No, don't die.
My God, don't die.
Get him into the Tardis, quick. Move!
But they don’t work against Daleks.
Yeah? Well, I'm going out fighting. Like Owen, like Tosh. How about you?
Exterminate!
Yes, ma'am!
Exterminate!
DONNA: What do we do?
There must be some medicine, or something.
Just step back. Rose, do as I say and get back!
He's dying. And you know what happens next.
What do you mean?
He can't.
Not now. I came all this way.
What do you mean? What happens next?
It's starting.
(TYRES SCREECHING) All human transport is forbidden!
I surrender! I'm sorry!
Daleks do not accept apologies! You will be exterminated!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
Exterminate!
(SHOUTING) JACK: Here we go. Good luck, Doctor!
DONNA: Will someone please tell me what is going on?
When he's dying, his body, it repairs itself. It changes.
But you can't!
I'm sorry, it’s too late.
I'm regenerating.
