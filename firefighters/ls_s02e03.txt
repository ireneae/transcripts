This is my buddy Spence.
Injured himself on the waterslide.
Captain Strand?
Captain Strand, the wind shifted.
How long was I out?
Almost an hour.
That's about all I need.
The weeks-long battle against the San Angelo fire continues at this hour, with officials now saying the blaze has consumed more than 180,000 acres <i>with less than 5% containment.</i> <i>Resources here in West Texas have been</i> <i>stretched to their limits,</i> <i>but help is now arriving from neighboring states.</i> <i>Fire companies from Oklahoma, New Mexico,</i> <i>and as far away as California are sending</i> <i>equipment and manpower to aid in this fight,</i> <i>a welcome sight to the embattled Texans</i> <i>on the front lines of this blaze,</i> <i>one that has to look a lot like the arrival</i> <i>of the cavalry.</i> Buck.
Wake up. We're here.
Oh, we are?
Ooh! What's up with the air?
The wildfire, remember? That's why we're here.
I mean the way it feels.
Like getting slapped with a wet towel.
It's called humidity.
Welcome to Texas, Buck.
I'm Deputy Chief De Leon of the San Angelo Fire Department, acting incident commander.
For those of you just joining the party, welcome.
Buck, stop staring.
I'm not staring.
You're staring.
I think that guy is staring at you.
I want to introduce my operations section chief, Captain Owen Strand out of Austin.
The thing we were praying wouldn't happen has happened.
The wind has shifted.
The fire's now on a collision course with the city of San Angelo.
There's a possibility of weather coming in, but we can't rely on it, and we won't.
We have one last shot to turn the tide.
Here. On Copper Ridge.
We cut a containment line here, and we can stop this beast in its tracks.
I know you're exhausted.
A lot of you haven't had But on behalf of the city of San Angelo and their 120,000 souls, we're gonna get you up on that fire line and you are gonna cut like hell.
Good luck. Stay safe.
Buck. Seriously?
Please don't make me report you to HR.
No, no, I swear I know her from somewhere.
It's killing me.
Captain!
We have a situation.
I thought all the evacuations had already happened.
That was before the wind shifted.
How many people are up there?
Eight kids, one counselor.
There's been no contact?
Not in at least eight hours.
It's a camp for at-risk teens, so those kids aren't allowed cell phones.
What's going on?
There's a bunch of kids at a camp trapped up past the fire line.
Can we get an evac chopper up here?
It's too dangerous, and these access roads are all aflame.
We can't get an engine up there.
Hey. Pardon me, Cap.
You could get to it with ATVs easy enough.
I used to ride around on ATVs in woods just like these growing up.
Firefighter, you just became strike team leader.
Hell, I'm in.
Driving through fire instead of digging a ditch?
Sign me up.
All right.
Eight man team. Take a medic.
You don't know what you're gonna find up there.
I'm a medic.
Eddie Diaz with the 118, Los Angeles.
You a paramedic?
Firefighter.
But I was a medic in the army, and on more than a few missions that looked a lot like this.
What you waiting for, Hollywood?
Get your bag. Meet us down by the motor pool.
We'll roll out.
Copy that.
Uh, where have you been?
Took a tour of the medical unit.
Where's Eddie?
I don't know.
You guys abandoned me.
Also, why did we drive these trucks all the way here from LA just to park 'em?
Only way up to that fire line is by foot.
Trucks go into the motor pool.
Commander De Leon will use them as he sees fit.
That's how it works, Buck.
Still, not sure I like the idea of strangers on our rigs.
No strangers here, Buck.
Just grunts with shovels.
Uh, okay. And where's yours?
Me?
I volunteered for base camp medical unit.
But have a good hike.
Eddie, can you believe this?
Hen is not going up the fire line with us.
Just gonna be you and me.
You ready, soldier?
Be right there.
Well, hop to it.
These at-risk kids aren't getting any less at-risk.
Uh, her? You're going with her?
Yeah.
Wait, guys, guys, guys, I know who that is!
She's Firefox.
Firefox?
You guys seriously don't know who Firefox is?
She's gone viral, like, five times.
Total badass.
I...follow her on Instagram.
Some reason, she didn't follow me back.
Don't forget your shovel.
Abandoners.
<i>Captain Strand.</i> <i>For a second, I thought that was a butt dial.</i> No butt dial. I was just checking in on you.
You're checking in on me?
You're the one fighting a wildfire.
I know Paramedic Rosewater's funeral was today, and I was very sorry to miss it.
Just...just seeing how you were holding up.
<i>But you're okay?</i> I think so.
'Cause after a trauma...loss like that...things can sneak up on you.
Captain Strand? <i>- Yes?</i> Are you okay?
Captain Strand?
You requested a list off all area searches and call-signs?
<i>I have that for you.
Yes. Thank you, Molly.</i> <i>I gotta go.</i> Got you some of them critters, Hollywood?
Bet they don't get that big in LA.
Oh, well, we got plenty in El Paso.
Oh, no way. You're from El Paso?
Where'd you go to high school?
La Salle.
La Salle.
Whoa, we used to whoop your ass every year at State.
I was Austin Heights.
You're a Bulldog?
Roger.
And I thought we were gonna be friends.
Whoo!
She always like that?
Always.
I only count seven kids.
IC said there was supposed to be eight.
Yep, and a counselor. Hey!
They're missing!
Back up. We're here now.
We're gonna get you all down the mountain, okay?
Marjan and Eddie's gonna check everybody out, make sure they're okay.
So...hey, hey, hey, who's missing?
Mr. Gomez.
He left last night looking for JJ, and he never came back.
JJ run away?
No, man.
He was out doing his solo.
Solo?
Yeah, it's two nights mandatory alone in the woods.
It builds character and self-respect, but it's usually pretty well-monitored.
You know that how?
Mr. Gomez have a cell phone?
He's the only one that does. We're not allowed.
No call in eight hours, it could just be bad reception.
Or something else.
Hey, hey. Oh. Oh.
Please help.
Oh.
Hey, where's JJ?
Couldn't find him.
He's not breathing.
Here.
Down, sir. There we go.
Marjan, grab the IV bag from the kit.
I'm gonna run a line.
Can you hold this?
Hey, men, let's back up.
Let's let them work. Back up. Right back here.
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
I'm not hearing any air escaping.
Lungs are intact.
Then why isn't his chest rising?
Ah, damn.
We need to do an escharotomy.
What the hell's that?
That burned tissue? It's callee eschar.
It's constricting his chest like a rope.
It's preventing his lungs from expanding.
He can't draw a breath. We need to cut it.
Now?
Now.
Okay.
Hope you're not squeamish.
Rescue breaths.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
JJ.
Easy, buddy. Easy.
Sir, we're aware of the missing kid, all right?
I need you to take nice and steady breaths.
Nicely done, Diaz.
You too, Firefox.
Put your backs into it!
We're almost there!
This road is everything.
We hold the line here, we put this fire on the ropes.
So LA, huh?
Yeah.
That's cool.
I got a cousin in LA. Marvin.
People say we look alike. Maybe you know him.
It's kinda a big place.
No, I know.
His last name's Chavez.
Yeah, I don't think so.
He's in jail anyway.
I bet you get some pretty crazy calls out there.
You have no idea.
We get our fair share in Texas.
You ever get a call at Disneyland?
That's Orange County.
But LA, right?
You know, we did get called to an amusement park once.
I had to scale the loop of a roller coaster.
Guy was hanging on by his bare hands.
You saved a guy hanging from a roller coaster?
Uh, he let go.
Man. That's rough.
I had a woman almost drown on me last year in less than a foot of water.
She was trapped in a bus upside down in the middle of the street.
It was wild, man.
We had a bus rescue.
It wasn't upside down though.
But it was sticking out the fifth floor of an office building.
No way!
That's insane.
We just had an active volcano last week.
Yeah, I think I saw something about that on my Twitter feed.
It looks like just the driver.
Hey, we're gonna get you out of there!
Move! Move!
Argh, it's locked!
Buck, heads up!
Come here, man. Come here, man.
Come here. Up, up, up. Up, up, up.
Hey.
Clyde!
Oh, damn it! Clyde!
Oh, thank God.
Oh, bad boy. Bad boy, Clyde. I am so sorry.
I left him alone for, like, ten seconds.
He must have unlocked the parking brake.
Your dog has a lead foot.
So that was weird.
Right?
Nice move, by the way. Good reflexes.
Yeah, you too.
Keep it dry.
Change the dressing every 24 hours.
<i>This is Great Oaks strike team.</i> <i>Do you copy?</i> This is base med unit. Go ahead.
<i>Sending seven minors your way.</i> <i>Mild dehydration, smoke inhalation,</i> <i>few lacerations, but they're fine.</i> <i>One adult male, critical.</i> <i>Gave him 11 milligrams of morphine.</i> <i>He will need a life flight.</i> Hey, Eddie. It's Hen.
You're sending out seven minors?
I thought you went up there for eight.
<i>One kid's still missing.</i> Couple of the guys from the ustin 126 are searching out for him now.
All right, you got about two hours of daylight left, and the wind reports are not good.
Yeah, it's getting a little toasty out here.
All right, Eddie, you need to put a clock on this.
I don't think any of these folks are leaving without this boy, clock or no clock.
Remind me a little of some other people I know.
Hey, JJ!
JJ!
Hey, JJ!
JJ!
JJ, if you can hear us, holler back!
We may have already passed it, 'cause that camp counselor was saying he was doing his solo right through here.
Hey, man, you never told me how you know about those things.
The solos?
Yeah, I didn't, did I?
Hey, JJ!
Just never pictured you as one of those at-risk camp kids.
And why the hell not?
Fair point.
JJ!
Slow down. Slow down.
JJ!
JJ!
JJ!
Fire must've came through here like a freight train.
Yep.
Hey, he must've had a head start on us, 'cause I don't see no remains.
Where the hell did he go?
JJ!
JJ!
JJ! Fire rescue!
I need reinforcements on that line.
Tell Tulsa company to take Houston's engine up there.
Yes, sir.
Captain Strand.
Henrietta Wilson, 118, Los Angeles.
What can I do for you, firefighter?
You can approve a chopper, equipped with a rescue winch and infrared FLIR tech to search the hillside before it gets dark.
To search for what?
A missing boy from Great Oaks.
The strike team was able to evacuate everyone except for one boy who's still missing.
That is right on the edge of the fire line.
That wind's blowing 20 knots.
I don't feel good about sending anybody up there.
All right, tell Commander De Leon I had to take a run up the mountain.
Maybe we should go out and help them search.
Judd told us to stay here.
That's what we should do.
How can you be so calm under literal fire?
Well, at least no one's shooting at us.
Seriously?
You wanna follow me on Insta?
Heard you put a lot of effort into it.
Was curious.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
I haven't been on social media in a while.
The last post is, like, nine months old.
Super boring.
I'll be the judge of that.
Fine. Deal.
Is that a Prius in the air?
Tornado dropped it between two buildings.
Huh.
Is this your kid?
Yeah, that's Christopher. He's my world.
Doing the whole, you know, single dad thing.
You did not build him a skateboard.
Yeah, well, Buck helped.
Wait, is that that creepy guy who was staring at me before?
He's harmless.
Mostly.
<i>Great Oaks search team,</i> <i>give us your current location.</i> <i>We're sending air support.</i> Air support?
Who's crazy enough to go up in something like this?
Appreciate this, Mark.
What are you doing here?
What does it look like?
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not. It's too dangerous.
It's too dangerous for you to fly into this without a medic.
We're burning daylight, Captain Strand.
Not crazy about this, Henrietta.
Yeah, me neither.
Call me Hen.
<i>Great Oaks strike team leader,</i> <i>this is air support.</i>
Judd, do you copy?
Cap, is that you?
<i>Yeah, I heard you could use a hand.</i> What's your 20?
<i>Yeah, we're a few klicks west of the camp.</i> <i>We haven't found this kid yet.</i> We found his tent, but no remains, so we think he went deeper into the woods trying to get away from the fire.
<i>All right, we see you.</i> Paul!
Captain Strand, I think I've got something.
Judd, we've got something under a grove of trees.
<i>South-by-southeast of your position.</i> <i>I'm gonna try to get over on top of it.</i>
Okay, Cap, we're coming at you.
JJ!
JJ!
All right, you're closing in. Less than 20 meters.
JJ, you out here?
Help!
I'm down here!
Help!
Here!
I'm over here!
God, it hurts! Help, please!
<i>Cap, we got him.</i> <i>- How's he look?
Not good.</i> His ankle's caught in a bear trap.
<i>Think you can get him out?</i> I don't know. It's got him pretty good.
All right, we're hooking him up to the LIFEPAK right now, but it looks like he's lost a lot of blood.
He's gonna lose a lot more when they try to free him.
What kind of loser gets caught in a bear trap running away from a bear, right?
There's bears?
I thought they were chasing the wolves.
There's wolves now?
They were running away from the fire.
They're gone now.
<i>Hey, Judd?</i> This is Paramedic Henrietta Wilson.
<i>I'm up here with your captain.</i> You've gotta be kidding me.
<i>I'm pretty sure you firefighters are</i> <i>fully equipped and capable to handle this.</i>
No, no, please. Walk us through it.
All right, before you do anything, <i>I need you to place a tourniquet</i> <i>3 inches above the wound.</i> <i>But not over the knee.</i>
All right, now, JJ, I ain't gonna lie, man.
This might hurt.
It's what I deserve.
Just like my dad always said.
I'm a waste of space.
We're gonna do this on three, okay?
One, two, three.
Okay.
There we go.
Okay.
There it is.
Okay, did it.
Tourniquet's on. What now?
<i>All right, get him out of the trap,</i> but keep the foot elevated above the heart.
<i>Then wrap the wound as fast and as tight as you can.</i>  Let's do it. Ready?
Oh, it's coming out.
All right, kid. There we go. We got this.
Talk to me, boys. Talk to me. What's happening?
<i>He ain't doing good.</i> He's bleeding out, he's crashing.
<i>You need to get fluids in him to stabilize him.</i>  Saline, now.
Hey.
Hey, man. Keep him talking, man. Keep him talking. Come on.
Hey, stay with us.
Judd, get in there. Talk to the kid.
Keep him awake.
Hey.
I know you think that you deserve this.
You're wrong.
You don't know anything about me.
Hell, son, I was you.
I was you.
And whatever fool thing you did to put yourself here, that don't matter.
Okay, years and years from now, this is gonna be another story you tell some other little idiot kid.
Okay? But you gotta stay with us now.
Come on, keep him talking, man.
Stay with us, JJ. Kid, come on.
Hey, man, keep him talking. Man, keep him talking.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, snap out of it. Snap out of it.
Keep him talking, man. Keep him talking.
I'm talking to you, boy!
"Oh, boohoo and poor me!" "I deserve this and everything else.
Why don't you stop being a little baby and grow a pair?
All right, you wanna know why life and this camp and probably your old man too keep kicking your ass, JJ?
Hey, he's slipping, man.
I got you. You wanna know why?
It ain't because you're weak and scrawny, even though you damn sure are.
It's because when you get hit, you don't stand up and swing back.
That's how come.
Now stand up and fight, damn it!
Hey!
There it is.
Hey, his heart rate's back up to 100.
That's a good fight, kid.
That's a good fight.
Miss Henrietta, the fluids worked.
<i>I'm very glad to hear it.</i> All right, I'm gonna harness up for the rescue.
Not with these gusts.
We shouldn't be up here much longer.
Judd, can you get him out of there on an ATV?
Yeah, that ain't a problem.
I gotta pick up Marjan and Diaz.
Roger that. See you back at base.
<i>Base, we need assist.</i> <i>Mayday. Mayday. We are going down.</i> <i>This is a distress call.</i> <i>Mayday. Mayday. We are going down.</i> Oh, God.
Oh, come on. It's California.
Of course you're gonna have earthquakes.
But you can't tell me that that's cooler than the 126 going up against a solar storm.
What even is that? You can't see it.
Guys.
Don't you see what you're doing?
You're falling into the classic Iron Man versus Captain America trap.
Is Captain America better because he's a super soldier with an indestructible shield, or is Tony Stark better because he's a tech genius with a sick weaponized suit?
So? Who's better?
Neither is better, bro. That's the point.
It's a specious argument.
They're both badass.
And when they team up, nobody could beat them.
Except maybe Thanos.
Oh, glad to see strike team's already got their feet up.
Ooh, you guys must be exhausted.
All that go-karting up and down the hill?
You didn't hear, did you?
Hear what?
Yeah, that radio's dead.
I can't get cell reception to save my life.
Hopefully Command can pull GPS from the chopper to find us.
Hopefully. How's he doing?
Sedated.
Fractured femur, couple of cracked ribs.
He'll live.
Don't speak too soon.
You feel that?
It's creating its own wind.
It's a firestorm.
Gonna find some shelter.
Okay, we're...somewhere near here?
This could work.
That could work.
Feel that?
It's making its own wind.
What?
You just repeated yourself.
I think I should probably check you out.
Do you know what day it is?
It's night.
You know where you are?
Somewhere I really don't wanna be.
All right.
Uneven pupillary responses, Captain.
I think you might have a concussion.
So what are you gonna tell me, to stay off my feet?
Avoid stress?
Or in this case, run like hell!
Yeah, but what we need to do is get containment in here, here, or if I make it myself...
This is a joke!
We know exactly where the chopper went down.
So why haven't you sent out a rescue team?
As I said, the beacon is coming from two miles inside an active burn zone.
It is not safe to send anyone up in the dark.
Commander, with all due respect, we accept the risk and we ain't asking anybody else to go.
You know I can't authorize that.
No, those are our people up there.
They could be bleeding out right now.
Dying.
Son, we haven't had any cell or radio contact at all since the Mayday.
Nobody else is risking their lives tonight.
And your father would be the first one to agree with me.
Okay, that's good.
I've spent my whole career running to danger, but there's never actually been a sign.
The deeper we get, the more protected we'll be from the heat.
Here. Right there.
Okay.
All right.
This is good. All right.
I got him.
Okay.
How's he doing?
He's hanging in there.
Can you believe this?
It's like stepping back in time.
Hey, is that what I think it is?
Oh, my God, that's dynamite.
It's gotta be 100 years old.
Guess worksite safety wasn't a thing back then.
Remind me to lodge a complaint with OSHA if we ever get out of here.
This is the end of the line.
All right, well, we better get comfortable.
It's gonna be a minute before anybody comes looking for us.
And you'll let me know if you start feeling dizzy, right?
Oh, don't worry about me.
It's kinda my job at the moment.
You picked the right person to be in a helicopter crash with.
Oh, yeah? Why's that?
'Cause I'm invincible.
My wife will be glad to hear.
Sure, you survived. It's great for you.
Captain, you okay?
Yeah.
Okay. I will.
I love you too.
What's up?
Well, they just delivered 20 kinds of pizza if you're hungry.
I'm good. Thanks.
They survived the crash.
Believe it.
And your dad is with Hen, so...
so he's in really good hands.
So is she.
No doubt.
Look, my captain is not my dad, but he might as well be.
You know, he could've given up on me so many times, and he never did.
Even when I used to steal the fire truck.
You used to steal the fire truck?
Oh, yeah.
All the time.
Yeah, my dad, he's never given up on me either.
And I've done a lot worse than steal a fire truck.
It just sucks, you know?
Just sitting here and doing nothing.
Well...
what if we didn't have to?
Is that...
A key to a fire truck?
Yes, it is.
Damn it.
I still can't get a signal.
Yeah, me either.
You're in a mineshaft, genius.
So how long have you been married?
You mentioned a wife.
Oh, good, small talk.
Almost eight years now.
Karen. She's a rocket scientist.
A literal rocket scientist?
Well, she's a stay-at-home rocket scientist at the moment.
Cutbacks at JPL.
You have kids?
Denny is ten.
And our little Nia, she's three.
You?
One son. TK.
You might have met him.
He works with me.
He's probably climbing the walls right now.
Now that you mention it, I did notice the resemblance at the briefing.
Yeah, people say that.
I think he looks like his mom, Gwen.
If the plague was good for one thing, it was getting us back together.
After 15 years of being divorced, it looks like we're giving it another go-around, which sounds crazy as I say it out loud.
You know what's crazy?
Getting hit by a lava bomb. That is crazy.
I'm sorry.
For what?
The wind has shifted.
We gotta find another way out.
There is no other way out.
If the wind keeps blowing smoke in here, we won't last ten minutes.
You know she's never seeing those kids again.
Shut up.
We picked a real nice tomb though.
I said shut up!
Captain Strand, I believe you're talking to somebody who's not here.
I'm aware.
But he did give me a good idea.
You sure it's still here? Maybe they deployed it.
Not according to the board.
All right, go, go, go, go, go.
Hey.
You know you don't have to do this.
There's no reason that both of us get fired.
Hey, my friend's up there too.
She would do the same thing for me.
I think.
She would.
Okay.
Oh, hey, here it is. Let's go.
Uh, no. That's not it.
What do you mean? 118, Los Angeles. Let's go.
Yeah, no, we're not taking that.
Bobby would kill me if I brought it back home tsashed seven. No. (?) This is the key to your truck.
Hey, dumbass. Dumbasser.
Did you stop and consider the consequences of what you're about to do at all?
You obviously don't know Buck.
You two didn't seriously think that you could sneak off and drive into wildfires, did you?
Yes?
Well, that ain't gonna happen.
You think you're gonna stop us?
Stop you?
We're going with you.
Come on, let's go.
You think these being 100 years old make 'em more or less stable?
Definitely less. You see the crystals?
That's nitroglycerine.
It sweats out of the dynamite after years and recrystallizes.
Definitely makes it more volatile.
Kay, put it down nice and easy.
Yep.
God. I hope this isn't overkill.
Better to have too much than too little.
Give me your brush jacket.
Feeling chilly?
If we're gonna lock ourselves in a mine, we may as well leave a marker outside just in case somebody comes by.
Smart.
Alright. Okay.
Wish me luck.
Try not to blow us up.
For the record, this wasn't actually my idea.
Okay.
All right.
Are we really doing this?
I don't think we have much of a choice.
Unless dying of smoke inhalation is your thing.
Wanna do the honors?
Go, go, go, go!
Is it just my traumatic brain injury, or does the air in here feel a little thin?
Every time we exhale, we poison the air a little bit more.
Unventilated mines fill up fast with CO2, nitrogen, and water vapor.
It's called black damp.
Maybe this wasn't the best plan.
It was the only plan.
I should never have let you get on that chopper.
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?
You're invincible, remember?
Yeah.
It's the...people around me that tend not to be.
Is that what's been haunting you?
Someone who didn't make it?
The people who didn't make it couldn't fit into this mineshaft.
But recently, a paramedic...
got killed not two feet from me.
It's brutal.
Brutal sometimes.
Being the one who survives.
Yeah, pisses me off.
I lost 14 of my brothers on 9/11.
We all went into the tower, but...I'm the only one who walked out.
I've never admitted this to anyone.
I've never forgiven them.
You got a lot of guilt about it.
I've got guilt over everything.
Over surviving, over forcing my son to follow in my footsteps, over the failure of my marriage, over...telling this all to a complete stranger.
We're probably gonna die anyway.
Now you're just trying to cheer me up.
You wanna talk about guilt, Captain?
I killed a girl.
With my ambulance.
Evelyn.
16 years old.
I'm so sorry.
So yeah, you're not the only one...locked in here...with a ghost.
Hen?
Henrietta?
Night-night.
Dad!
Hen!
Hen!
Dad!
Hen!
Dad!
Cap!
Cap!
They're not in here. Buck, they're not in here.
Hey, they made it out.
Get clear!
They made it out!
Hey, let's fan out and let's search this area here, yeah?
Dad!
Hen!
Cap!
Cap!

We're here.
I got a pulse!
Stay with me. Hey.
Stay with me. Stay with me.
I got you. I got you.
Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad. We're here. We're here.
We got you, Cap.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Stay with us.
Pulse is slipping. Come on, we gotta move.
Hey, you'll be all right.
Dad.
Look who's up.
Captain Vega.
What are you doing here?
Wait a minute. Are you here?
I'm here, Owen.
Here, take these.
They'll help with that headache.
When'd you get in?
Uh, first light.
After our talk yesterday, I couldn't shake the feeling that maybe you needed a friend out here.
Turns out you have several.
Could always use another.
Thank you for coming.
Y'all put a real hurt on that fire, by the way.
Between the containment line and the rain last night, they're saying it's boxed in.
Commander dismissed all the out-of-state crews.
So if y'all get hungry, there's a great barbecue place in Fort Stockton called Rudy's Ribs.
You just tell 'em that Judd sent you.
Thanks, but I think we're gonna go to my parents' in El Paso to eat.
Judd, you're all right, even if you were a bulldog.
Well, it makes sense that a California firefighter as good as you had to have been raised in Texas, so...
All right, brother.
Hey, Marwani.
Was hoping I could get a pic for Insta.
I thought you were off social media.
Yeah, well, it's not every day you get to take a selfie with #Firefox.
Oh, now, that is just way too much pretty.
Shut up, Strickland.
Brother.
Great work up there.
Hey, great working with you guys.
And for the love of God, please follow Buck back on Insta.
Marvin Chavez.
C-H-A-V-E-Z.
He gets out in about three months.
I will keep my eyes open.
Cool, cool. Drive safe.
Hey, Buck.
You really put yourself out there.
Can't thank you enough.
It's what we do, right?
Ooh, hey, if you ever find yourself in LA, we should get together.
Sure.
I gotta mention, though, I already have a boyfriend and it's pretty serious, so...but it was really nice meeting you, man.
Take care.
Uh...oh.
Great working with you, man.
Great working with you too.
Where's Hen?
I'd say I'm glad to see you back on your feet, but you shouldn't be back on your feet.
I heard you were shipping out, and I wanted to make sure I caught you.
I'm still amazed we made it out of there alive.
Told you. I'm invincible.
Is that really your takeaway from the experience?
I cannot think of a more logical explanation for how we survived what we did and still walked out of there alive.
Well, actually, I can think of about two teams of logical explanations.
And we didn't walk out. We were carried out.
Who knew you could get so stoned on oxygen?
<i>In O2 veritas.</i> Pure oxygen can give rise to feelings of euphoria.
Yeah, I'm not so sure it was euphoria I was feeling.
What happens in the mineshaft stays in the mineshaft.
I appreciate that.
Maybe that's not the only thing that could stay in the mineshaft.
Maybe you could leave some of those ghosts in there too.
It was a pleasure to share a foxhole with you, Captain.
Call me Owen.
Take care of yourself, Owen.
Even if you are invincible.
