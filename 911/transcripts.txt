ABBY: What's your emergency?
The first kind of emergency is the one we all have, every day.
You're looking at my emergency right now.
I'm 42 years old.
It's been a year since my boyfriend Tommy broke up with me.
I'm still not over it.
My mom's a big part of my emergency.
Alzheimer's disease, late-stage.
Mom, I'm going to work.
Veronica's in the kitchen.
Taking care of her pretty much takes up all my free time.
There's my number, right there, in case you need to call me for anything.
You don't have to tell me every time.
Sometimes you forget.
And then you forget you forget.
No, you're not.
Careful, careful. You got it. Good, good.
Ah.
I'm healed.
You look good today.
Mm.
Have a good day.
Drive carefully.
I will.
Ooh, you smell good.
Woo-hoo!
ABBY: Then there's the second kind of emergency, the kind you never want to have, the kind that comes without warning -- the car crash, the fire, the heart attack, the break-in.
That's the kind you call me about.
I'm the actual first responder.
WOMAN: My son.
He hit his head on the diving board, and he's not breathing.
ABBY: What's your address, ma'am?
Uh, 242 Beatrice Lane.
I'm in Beverly Hills. Please hurry!
Okay, paramedics are on the way.
Oh, my God.
He's turning blue!
I need you to perform CPR on him.
Do you remember what to do?
30 chest compressions followed by two breaths.
Okay.
30 and two.
Okay, Buck, start chest compressions.
Hen, start bagging him.
HEN: Got you, Captain.
Ma'am, come with me. I need to get my team in there.
Don't worry. He's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right. Please, just take a seat.
HEN: Get some of that water out.
BUCK: Coming around. Starting compressions.
CHIMNEY: Pulse ox is on. Pad's on.
I don't know.
A few minutes, maybe.
...seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...
No.
...18, 19, 20. Go.
No rhythm.
BUCK: Come on. Come on.
ABBY: The crazy part is that as soon as help arrives...
...most people just hang up.
HEN: It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
BUCK: Hey. Hey, man. That's it. Get it out.
BOBBY: Good job, kid.
Good job. Good job.
All right, kid, your mom is right here.
Whew.
You're gonna be okay.
Thank you.
You'll be okay.
ABBY: I guess it's for the best that I usually don't know how it all ends.
The fireman is trying to talk her down.
This is so messed up.
ABBY: Are you friends with her?
Can you talk to her?
Well, we just get high together.
Everybody who's ever tried something like this and survived says the same thing: the second they step off that ledge, they regretted it.
I've been where you are.
I know how you feel.
Believe me.
There's hope.
Okay?
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I'll tell you all about it.
I can help you.
Please. Please.
No one can help me.
JUNKIE: No, no, no, no, no, no!
She jumped. She jumped.
ABBY: Is it weird that I feel more comfortable dealing with these kinds of emergencies than the one I have to deal with when I leave work and go home?
I don't know.
911. What's your emergency?
WOMAN: Yeah, I'm in the drive-through, and they only gave me six nuggets in my nine-piece, and this bitch manager won't give me my extra nugs.
Ma'am, it's against the law to call 911 with a non-emergency.
Eat your nuggets, get some perspective, and get the hell off my line.
* In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
...Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
My last confession...
* Baby, you're a firework * Come on, show 'em what you're...*
I'm so, so sorry. Um...
I'm new.
Mm.
But you're familiar with the basics of how this all works?
I am fully authorized to absolve any venial sins and assign penance.
What if I have to confess a mortal sin?
I'm kidding. Do you want to do this out on the pews?
Oh. Yes. Please.
My last confession was a week ago.
I was an alcoholic.
Did some drugs, too, near the end -- painkillers.
Lost a decade of my life, in and out of rehab.
Put on forced leave by the fire department.
But I got myself back together, and I've been back on the job for 18 months.
Your last confession was a week ago.
Weren't you already absolved?
It helps me to confess it all once a week, to remind myself how easy it is for me to end up on the wrong path.
But this week, I lost one. A woman.
A jumper.
PRIEST: It must be hard being a first responder.
The only way to survive the job is to find a way to cope with the ones you lose.
This is why you drank?
Like I said, we all find ways to cope.
Some drink, some do drugs, some gamble.
Some are sex addicts.
* We sit around * Our money's spent * Why can't you all get down?
* Drive ancient cars * Can't pay the rent * Why can't you all get down?
* Drink the water, it's a drought *
* How are you this scared? This scared? *
Groovyheels297?
This is cheating.
No, no, no.
You said if I got to you in five minutes, you would be all mine.
Is this why they call you Firehose?
No.
* Bad reputation * Bad reputation.
Someone punch you in the face?
What? Nah, it's a...it's a birthmark.
I dig it.
Hey, can I, uh...
...can I get your actual number?
You're cute.
And...you're very good at whatever it is we just did.
Let's not ruin everything by actually getting to know each other.
Damn.
We're living in a golden age.
POWELL: Merry Christmas.
Police, there's automatic rifle fire at Nakatomi!
I need backup assistance now!
McCLANE: Welcome to the party, pal!
CHIMNEY: I know exactly what that polite, distant smile means: she's bored.
One foot out the door.
This woman's so far out of my league, but she's just once-in-a-lifetime.
I can't let her go.
Lots of fish in the sea.
Not with the bait he's using.
Cruel but true. Mm.
I met her on this new dating site just for cops and firefighters, RomancingTheUniform. com.
She's an adrenaline junkie, so foreplay is me telling her stories about running into burning buildings and jumping into icy lakes and...
I'm sorry, wait. Remind me, when is the last time you ran into or jumped over anything?
I embellish a little.
Oh. Noted.
I'm telling you, the uniform is a major aphrodisiac.
Clearly.
Oh, damn.
Whew.
Hey!
I just...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wash your hands.
We don't know where they've been.
I was in the neighborhood.
I was just, uh, getting it washed.
They charge you extra for the full detail?
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
BOBBY: Listen, I like you. You're a good firefighter.
I know we got this thing -- you call me "Pops," and I give you a hard time for being a dumbass kid, we went to a Springsteen concert together.
But this is not a family. It's not a clubhouse.
So I'm writing you up.
Come on, Bobby.
See the fire, put out the fire. The rest is blah-blah.
No. The system and the rules are not arbitrary.
First infraction. Two more, you're out.
Wash your hands.
Thanks.
You know, you're not helping him by going easy on him.
He just needs a little direction.
I'll remind you of that after he gets you killed.
Anyone want to pass me a spoon, so I can serve myself some salad?
911, what's your emergency?
Yeah, hi, I live in an apartment on 876 McCain.
I'm in my bathroom and I think I hear a baby crying. In the wall.
How is the baby on the wall?
No no no, not on the wall. In the wall.
I think someone flushed a baby down the toilet.
There's a baby inside my wall.
Oh, no.
No.
Let's do it.
The fourth floor.
I'll race you.
Ah, race yourself, Rambo.
I'm 50 years old. I'm taking the elevator.
Who's Rambo?
I don't hear anything.
Look, I'm telling you, I heard a baby crying.
Someone flushed a baby down the toilet.
Oh, I'm not high.
Okay, I-I'm pretty high, but it's a sativa.
You know? I-It makes you happy.
I-It doesn't make you hallucinate.
It could've been a cat, right?
Sometimes rats get stuck in the walls.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
Hey, do you know what, can you give me a stethoscope?
Okay.
Thanks.
Give me a pen. Give me a Sharpie.
Hey!
All right.
We need to open up this wall.
No, no. We're being punked.
It's a tape recorder or something. Right, Spicoli?
Mm-mm. Maybe he's right.
Maybe a mother gives birth on the toilet and flushes it.
Okay, first of all, that's awful.
Second, do you not know how a toilet pipe works?
There's this piece of serpentine pipe that takes the waste from the toilet to...
If this is a premature baby, its bones could bend and compress like sponges.
Okay? We need to go in there.
Stand back. I got this!
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!
Did you even stop to consider that you might hit a baby?
Yeah, I didn't think so. Go get the saw.
Okay. I'm, uh, I'm gonna...
Try to find some common sense while you're down there.
Fire and Rescue were first to arrive.
Theory is that some kid gave birth on a toilet and tried to flush the evidence, which got stuck in a pipe.
Theory? Has anyone located the mother to see if the theory's correct?
How many floors above where you were hearing the crying?
Uh, floor five and floor six.
All right, let's start on five.
Knock on every door. Don't be shy about going in if something doesn't seem right.
Don't we need a warrant or something?
Do I look like I'm asking you to make an arrest?
Let's do this.
LAPD!
LAPD. LAPD.
Hey. You have a teenage girl living here?
LAPD. LAPD.
All right.
All right, let's get it out.
Guys, that-that pipe services a quarter of the toilets above us; that's gonna be messy.
Oh, shoot.
Which means, even with the water off, if somebody flushes a toilet above us, it could drown the baby.
LAPD. Open up, sir.
Do you have a teenage girl living here with you?
I wish.
HEN: Do not flush your toilet! This is LAFD.
No one flush your toilets!
Do not flush your toilet!
This is LAFD!
Again, no one flush your toilet!
Hey, Hen. How's your day going?
Athena, peachy.
Do not flush your toilets!
LAPD. Open up. LAPD! LAPD!
This is LAFD. Please.
LAPD.
Nobody flush your toilets!
Okay? Please, don't.
Hey, sir. Sir!
Sir, we're looking for a girl...Uh, hey!
* Chimney.
Cut right down here on the bottom.
All right, Chimney, help me out, help me out.
Easy, easy, easy.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Up, hold it up.
Hold it up.
All right. All right, I see it. I see it.
Down. Let's pull it down here at the bottom.
Buck, I got it.
You got to cut right here.
Yeah.
Hold it still.
All right, it's off.
Get the head out, Bobby. Get the head out.
Yeah. You got to push from below.
All right.
Get the defibrillator.
I'm on it.
Yeah.
Just the lube, Buck.
All right. Here, Bobby.
Take it, take it.
All right, give it...
All right, work that in there, work that in there.
Got it up there. I got it. I got it.
All right, guys.
Wow, wow. Wow.
This is gonna be a scoop and run.
Hen, get the ambulance ready.
I'm ready here.
BOBBY: Okay, ready?
Come on.
It's moving.
It's coming. It's coming.
Oh, my God.
Stay on the shoulders.
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Pull, pull. All right. Geez.
Okay, pull her out. Pull her out. Pull her out.
Pull her out.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
All right, she's not breathing. Starting CPR.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Maybe her airway's blocked.
Yeah.
I-I'll get the, uh...
Yep.
Get the pump.
Buck, come on!
I'm coming! I'm...
Yeah, she's not breathing. Bobby, it's-it's not working.
Come on.
Come on.
I got you.
I got you.
There we go. There we go.
Excellent.
There we go.
Yeah.
All right. Okay, wrap her up.
Let's go.
Down to the lobby. Here we go.
All right, let's go, let's go.
Guess not.
Sorry, Cap. Come on, come on, come on.
Yo, give her to me. Yo, come on, I'm twice as fast.
Come on.
All right, you go.
Okay.
I got you.
I got you. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be great.
What happened?!
What you want?!
No.
MAN: Marika.
Your daughter just had a baby.
We have to get her to the hospital.
Go get ready! Get ready!
Come on, move it!
Come on, get ready!
Yeah, I got you.
Let's go.
Make way, folks. Make way.
Let's go, let's go!
Make way.
Hold up! Hold up! I got another one coming.
BUCK: Yo, is that the mother? No.
Screw her! Look what she did!
She's bleeding out!
She's a child!
He is refusing to take...
Okay, Bob.
All right, all right, come on.
Come on.
Marika.
Come on, guys. Hurry up.
Okay? Hurry up!
Yo, if this baby dies, it's on you.
MAN: Marika.
Hospital ETA, five minutes.
Hang in.
Gonna go over here.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Whoa. All right.
O2 sat 59.
I can't get a pulse.
MARIKA: I'm so sorry.
Is she gonna die?
Come here. Give me your hand.
It's all right. It's okay.
Here we go.
All right.
See? Told you we'd make it, didn't I?
Come on. Oh, here we go.
You ready Oh. Hey.
They're gonna take care of you now, okay?
You're gonna be okay now, aren't you?
Get the baby to the NICU.
Get the mother hooked up in room four.
All right.
I'm gonna see you in there. All right, come on, Bobby.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hold on. Where you going?
That baby is alive because of us.
Don't-don't we have some kind of obligation?
I'll give them a call; we'll be lucky if they tell us if she's okay.
There's nothing more we can do.
We did our jobs very well today, so far.
Just be proud of that. Now it's their turn.
ATHENA: Hey!
You do not get to choose who lives and who dies.
'Cause I was under the impression that kind of was my job.
That mother was no less of a child than her baby.
You're gonna get someone killed.
Well, maybe, but not today.
Yeah, you keep making jokes.
I promise you, the next time you screw up, it'll be your last.
What?
Get in the truck.
Good morning, everyone.
You want a waffle?
ATHENA: Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No whispering at the table.
You got something to say, just speak up.
Would it be okay if only one of you guys came to family day at school tomorrow?
MAY: Because you can't stand being in the same room together, anyway.
It makes everyone uncomfortable.
Are you getting a divorce?
Of course not, sweetheart.
You're lying.
Hey, watch your mouth.
ATHENA: Baby.
Married people have problems all the time.
But you two never fight or argue unless it's something really bad.
I want to tell them.
Michael.
My therapist said tell them when they're ready.
Well-well, I'm saying that I'm not ready.
Come here. Come here, baby.
Michael.
Kids, your dad has been struggling with something his entire life.
But...
with the courage that I get from being your dad, the way that you love me and see me...
Please.
...I feel strong enough to be honest about it.
I'm gay.
So you are getting a divorce.
No, no, sweetheart. We're not even talking about that.
May, baby, y-your dad just told me a couple of weeks ago.
The grandmas are gonna whisper about us in church now.
And the kids at school are gonna find out, and maybe beat Harry and I up about it.
MICHAEL: No. No.
Your mother and I will not let that happen. Do you understand?
Can't you just keep it a secret?
I'm fine with whatever.
I just don't want anybody else to know.
May, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look...
Don't look at me like that.
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
You know, I get that you feel good about coming out.
Good for you.
Please.
But don't think you can hide behind that pride when it comes to me.
You lied to me.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Get -- Don't you touch me!
Don't you touch me! How could you do this to me?!
Okay.
You should have told me from the beginning!
I didn't have to tell you. You already knew.
But you just went along to get along.
Oh, I'm sorry if I thought that the fact that my husband didn't pay other women any mind meant he was true to me!
Look, you even said it yourself.
I don't lay you like other men.
You humiliated me just so you wouldn't humiliate yourself.
And if you don't see that, you're the one that's in denial.
Yes.
Hey, you know, denial worked just fine when you were a 37-year-old single woman whose biological clock was running out.
You were perfectly happy to deny what you could clearly see about me.
And I said that I wanted those kids, too.
Don't you forget that!
What is that?
You've had it, like, a million times, Mom.
Don't think I like it.
Well...
Why don't you save it for when your dad gets back from work, hmm?
He's not coming home, is he?
No.
Oh.
Yeah.
Mm, yeah.
For, like, ten years.
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.
Don't be sorry.
You're just having a tough day today.
Hmm.
And Veronica's here.
Veronica, you're half an hour late.
I have to get to work. You can't keep doing this, or I'm gonna have to hire somebody else.
Whatever.
I work for SSI. I can't be fired, just moved off to someone else.
Wow, I really love that go-getter attitude, V.
I love you, Mom.
Love you, darling.
You take care of yourself today, okay?
Bye, Mom.
911, what's your emergency?
Help...can't breathe.
I can't understand you. Are you saying you can't breathe?
777 Detroit Avenue...it's choking me.
I have the fire department on the way. Who is choking you?
Do you know him?
My snake.
L. A. fire!
All right, guys, check all these rooms.
Anybody here?
L. A. fire!
Wow.
Oh, my God.
Bobby, I can't do snakes. They scare the crap out of me.
That scene from Conan the Barbarian with the giant snake, it traumatized me for life.
I-I can't.
Conan the Barbarian. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
1982. Geez.
Dude, as far as I'm concerned, the world began the day I was born.
BOBBY: Guys, in here. Back here, guys, now.
HEN: Oh, my God.
We got to help her get some air, guys.
Oh, my...
Oh, my God. Oh, I...This is not good.
HEN: Bobby, it's no use. That thing is, like, ten feet long.
Its constriction strength is, like, 50 pounds per square inch.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna start calling you "Snake-ipedia." Stop it.
All I'm saying is that you'd stand a better chance of tearing down a cement wall with your bare hands.
Why don't I just punch it in its face?
You can't punch it in the face, Buck. It's a snake.
It's not some guy at an El Torito happy hour.
HEN: Look, I have Dilaudid.
We can inject the snake. It'll pass right out.
BOBBY: How much time is that gonna take?
Minutes. And minutes we don't have.
I think we're gonna have to put it down.
Kill it. No! No, um, no!
Kill it. Just kill it.
It's a snake.
It's doing what nature intended for it to do.
Nobody told this fool to bring a snake into her house!
Yeah, well, I'll make a donation to PETA for you.
Crap. It's getting really tight.
BUCK: Okay, stand back.
We don't have time for this!
Buck!
No!
Okay.
Wow. Why is that always the first option for you white boy, macho tough guys?
Guys, I am totally gonna take credit for this with Tatiana.
It's gonna get me laid for a week. Thank you.
Oh, Spartacus.
Yeah, well, it was him or you, and, uh, when faced with a situation like that, I always choose to save the more attractive one.
Is that right?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
HEN: Okay.
Hard pass. I'm gonna skip the part where the two idiots flirt.
You can expect a visit from animal control.
Hey, Buck.
Oh.
Ah.
Really?
Um...
I'm a collector. I'm not a hoarder.
I think you should probably leave.
Um, did you follow me here?
The truck has a GPS beacon, moron.
Ugh.
No. W...
Just call me later if you're free.
I'll be at home. Alone.
You're fired.
What? Wait. That's not fair. You said I got three strikes.
Doesn't matter. You've made this choice yourself, and you rubbed it in my face.
The same exact infraction two days after I wrote you up.
It's not 1950 anymore, Buck. We work with women side by side.
When you swing your dick around, you disrespect them.
Wait, Bobby! Bobby, I-I think I may be a sex addict.
Self-diagnosed.
You think this is a joke?
No.
I'm not joking.
How much does your kit weigh when you're fully geared up?
Uh, I don't, I don't know.
60 pounds, give or take.
Right. 60 pounds.
So when you choose this life, you find a way to leave everything behind you, except that 60 pounds.
I don't care if you got problems with your wife, with money, with alcohol, with keeping it in your pants.
All that stuff weighs you down, it slows you down, and if we lose a couple seconds, people die.
So, you want to disrespect yourself, that's fine with me.
You want to disrespect these women that you chase around, that's on them, but you are done disrespecting our firehouse and this fire department.
No, Bobby. Bobby! I need this job!
Look, I love this job.
Don't do this to me.
I don't have anything else.
I'm sorry, kid. I said you're done.
I guess you heard?
Yeah.
For what it's worth, everyone thinks it sucks.
It's my own fault.
Yeah.
Everyone thinks that, too.
I'll be honest.
When Bobby first brought you on board, I told him he should just get a Dalmatian instead.
But I'm legit sorry to see you go.
You got some skills.
Just not a lot of discipline.
Look, hey, um, I don't suppose you could maybe talk to him for me?
DISPATCHER: Ladder, medic. 10-36 auto emergency.
Hey, tough break, kid.
DISPATCHER: Ladder, medic. 10-36 auto emergency.
Hen, let's roll.
911, what's your emergency?
Help me, please! They're outside, they're trying to break in!
My mom's not home from work yet.
I'm by myself! I don't know what to do!
Okay, okay, stay calm. What's your name?
Lily.
Lily, how old are you?
I'm nine.
Okay, Lily, my name is Abby. I'm gonna try to help you.
What's your address?
I don't know.
We just moved here.
Do you know what street you live on?
Um, Lambert.
Okay, Lambert.
It's a brown house! Hurry!
Lily?
Shoot.
Residential break-in.
Caller is a nine-year-old female, home alone.
No GPS on her phone, no street address.
She did have a street name -- Lambert.
There are three Lamberts in the greater L. A. area: Boyle Heights, Santa Fe Springs and Winnetka.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.
They got in.
Where are you?
I'm up in my room.
Okay. That's okay. What is the name of your city?
W-Winnetka.
Okay. We got to start pinging cell towers.
Pinging towers in the Valley.
ABBY: Now, listen.
I need you to stay on the phone. Don't hang up.
We're gonna try to find you.
I've got multiple daytime break-ins in this area over the last couple of months.
Lily, is there anything near you that looks like it would have your address on it?
Mail or anything like that?
No.
Can you look outside?
LILY: I can't see any numbers.
TERRY: Towers narrow it to a quarter mile.
I know you said your house is brown. Is there anything else you can tell me about it?
ABBY: All available units, residential break-in on Lambert Road, Winnetka, somewhere between the 100 and 1500 blocks of Chanel and Hadley.
Two-story single family dwelling.
Brown house, white trim, garage door is white. Child alone in the home.
Caller says there's a pink girl's five-speed bike sitting on the front porch.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm in Steven Spielberg land.
LILY: I'm here.
What's your mother's name?
Emma.
Emma Coughlin.
Okay, we got 14 Emma Coughlins.
None of them in Winnetka.
ABBY: Do you know her phone number?
Uh, it's in the phone.
Here's what I want you to do.
Do not hang up the phone. Look at the menu in the phone, and read me what the number says.
I think so.
Stay on the line. I'm gonna call your mom now.
Okay.
LILY: It's ringing in her room.
Sometimes she forgets it on the charger.
ABBY: Officer, maybe if you put on your siren, I could determine where you are in relation to her.
I could guide you to her.
I don't think we want these guys knowing that the cops are here.
This area's had a spate of daytime break-ins recently, and one homicide.
We need to find this girl.
Maybe we still can.
HEN: Hey. What's up, Thena?
ATHENA: I need a favor.
Think you can loan me a fire truck?
Um, it's kind of in use at the moment. Why?
I'll have something for you in less than five.
She sent you, huh?
I was available.
All right. No heroics.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
I don't know what that means.
Nobody thought you would.
Lily?
Abby, I'm downstairs.
ABBY: What are you doing downstairs?
Petey! Petey!
Petey! There's a kid in the house who's got a phone.
PETEY: That's twice you said my name.
Now we got to find it.
PETEY: I'll get this one's phone.
Just need the phone.
(siren wailing, horn honking over phone) DEAN: It's the cops!
We've got it.
That's it.
You just passed her, cowboy.
Relax. It's just a fire truck.
Come on, kid. I just want the phone.
BUCK: Oh, yeah, I see the pink bike.
Yeah.
You, uh, you can't go in there right now.
Is there a fire?
No, no.
No, ma'am, no fire. Just come.
Just get behind the truck, okay? Come on.
PETEY: Come out, kid. We just want the phone.
DEAN: Petey!
I got her!
Officer, how close are you?
Close.
Abby!
Petey! Petey, Petey!
Petey! Petey!
Peter! Petey! Petey!
Peter! Petey!
This is 911 operator Abby Clark.
I need to explain something to you about this emergency.
This emergency is yours. I have dispatched the police to your exact location.
I know exactly what road they're gonna go down, I know what door they're gonna walk into, and I am prepared to help you escape.
Because I don't care about you at all, but I care about that little girl.
So you have exactly two seconds to make a decision here.
You can either walk away from her and walk away from the police, or you can sit there and wait for whatever hellfire is about to be brought down on your head.
PETEY: Get the kid.
No! No.
No! No! No!
What are you doing?! No!
No! No!
Okay, walk out the back door.
There's a road behind the house.
Back door.
What about the bike, man?
Forget the bike.
LILY: Let me out! Please!
PETEY: Yeah, I see it.
Because I have a grid of the entire neighborhood in front of me.
You're gonna go over the wall.
Better not be any cops on the other side.
ATHENA: There aren't.
Just needed you out of the house.
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!
Petey!
You lying bitch!
ATHENA: Down! Down!
LILY: Let me out!
Fireman Buckley, what's going on there?
I don't know, uh...
LILY: Stop it!
Please! Help!
Lily!
Oh, crap.
Help me!
PETEY: Ow.
Mom!
Lily!
Mom!
Oh, my God.
ABBY: Officer.
Fireman Buckley, what's happening?
Are the suspects in custody?
Attention, all units.
Suspect on a motorcycle, heading east on Lambert.
East on Lambert.
Move! Move!
Cover, cover, cover!
ABBY: Fireman Buckley?
ATHENA: Don't you move!
Don't you move.
ABBY: Fireman Buckley, what's happening there?
Fireman Buckley, what's happening there?!
PETEY: Ow, I'm hurt!
No, you just think you are.
ABBY: I heard a gunshot. Is Where is she?
BUCK: The little girl? No, she's good.
She's back with her mom, and you should be here.
Oh, my God.
I feel like I am.
Wow. Um...
Okay, well, I can't thank you enough.
I-I...I'm so grateful.
You saved that little girl, and...
No, you did.
You kept her in the game long enough for us to find her.
You're the real hero here.
Well, I appreciate you saying that.
Thank you.
I know what this looks like.
Looks like you took the engine out in your street clothes.
I didn't really have time to change.
Athena Grant called me, wanted to tell me what an asset you are.
Told her she was half right.
("Under Pressure" by Queen playing) MICHAEL : Athena.
Uh, kids get home from school okay?
Yeah, yeah.
They're inside doing their homework.
Everything okay?
Yeah. Just checking in.
You giving me another chance?
You've used all your chances; so have I.
Because somehow I have failed to communicate to you how lucky we are to do what we do.
* Pressure...pushing down on me
You're wrong, Bobby.
I absolutely do get what a privilege it is to serve here.
And you know what? You were right to fire me.
I was a punk.
Uh, I still am one.
But I'm a punk who understands what he lost.
Just needed you to know that.
I hope you mean that.
So are we talking again now?
No.
MICHAEL: You want us to wait for you for dinner?
* Tomorrow gets me higher...
Yeah. Yeah.
Go get dressed.
* Da-da-da * Ooh * Da-da-da-da-da * Okay...
I think I'm not fired.
Your shift's not over yet.
* Chipping around * Kick my brains around the floor *
* These are the days, it never rains but it pours...*
* People on streets * Ee-da-de-da-de * People on streets * Ee-da-de-da-de-de-da
* It's the terror of knowing * What this world is about * Watching some good friends * Screaming, "Let me out!" * Tomorrow * Gets me higher, higher, higher *
* Pressure on people * People on streets, under pressure...*
ABBY: You know, it takes a certain kind of person to swim in the pain of the world and not get wet.
To run towards danger, rather than run away from it.
And for those of us that choose this life, there's no place we'd rather be.
911. What's your emergency?
@@@@@@
DEVON: Did you hear that?
Those were not screams of joy.
I know.
People are flipping out. Isn't it great?
I-I don't need to experience the kind of bowel-clenching fear that causes people to scream like that.
By the way, bowel clenching is another thing I'm afraid of.
Good. You can cross two fears off your list with one ride.
I don't want to do this.
All right, check it out.
There are two hot girls in front of us.
If we get out of this line, they will Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram our faces with #pussies.
I don't want to be a #pussy. Do you?
So you'd rather have me crap my pants than be humiliated in front of two complete strangers?
Absolutely.
Plus, they're hot.
So that's potentially thousands of strangers.
("Mess Around" by Cage the Elephant plays) * Oh, no * Oh, no * Oh, no * Oh, no * Ah * Oh, no * Ah...
Enjoy the ride.
Crap.
* Ah...
You're clenching your butt cheeks, aren't you?
I hate you.
Oh, my God.
Whoa, here we go!
Chad!
911, what's your emergency?
Oh my god. Some guy just got thrown off the rollercoaster.
He's just lying on the ground.
He's not moving. Send an ambulance.
DEVON: Please, hurry!
Buck, we came in at the wrong angle.
I'm gonna have you climb up there, harness him in, and hang tight while we move the truck.
You think you can handle that?
Hell yeah.
This daredevil hero stuff is what I signed up for, Bobby.
Good.
Help us! Please!
Everybody, try to stay calm.
We'll get you down, I promise, all right?
I need you to relax, I need you to breathe, and I need you to keep as still as possible.
You move less, you stay safe.
We get everyone off this ride safe.
Hey, what's your name, man?
Devon.
Devon. All right, Devon. Well, hang on, brother.
Where's Chad?
What happened to Chad?
Hey, Bobby, he's asking about his friend.
BOBBY: Chimney, it's Captain, you copy?
Copy, Captain. What do you need?
How's the kid on the ground?
He's gone.
We lost him.
All right, I don't need the people up there seeing that.
So, do me a favor...
He survived, right?
Get him on a gurney. You know the drill.
Copy that.
BUCK: Hang in there, guys. We're coming.
I'm almost there.
What happened to Chad?!
He's dead, isn't he?
Hey, Devon, look at me.
Chad...He's getting help. You see?
He's gonna be fine.
And I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, all right?
No, we're not okay!
Why is the fire truck going away?
It's just getting into a better position, that's all.
Devon, how we doing?
It's gonna be everywhere.
It's gonna be all over the place.
Hey.
Forget about them, okay? You don't look down.
You look up at me.
You see this strap here?
All you got to do is reach up your arm, slide it through the loop.
I can't!
Yes, you...
I can't!
Yes, you can, buddy. You can do it.
Come on, Buck. Come on, Buck.
Can you tell them to stop recording, please?
I don't want everyone to see me like this.
Listen, Devon, I need you to concentrate.
Slide your arm through the loop...
and then we can deal with everything else.
All right.
Hey. Reach up your hand. Come on.
It's, like, three inches. You can do this. I got you.
Devon.
Devon, I need you to trust me.
Give me your hand.
I will not let you go.
I can't.
Devon. Devon, please.
Hey, Devon!
Oh!
I'm not hungry.
This is America, Buckaroo.
Eating has nothing to do with being hungry.
Man, I was right there.
You know, all he had to do was reach up and grab my hand.
CHIMNEY: People do funny things at times like that.
Sometimes they just freeze up.
I've never lost anyone before.
No.
Look, people die, and that's part of the gig, right?
See, your problem is, you're looking at every job like it's a long-term relationship.
They're one-night stands, man.
In that moment, they mean everything to you, but once the morning comes...it's on to the next one.
HEN: Hey.
You guys don't mind, I brought some company to family dinner.
Athena's going through some, uh, some stuff at home, so she could use some TLC.
BOBBY: Well, we don't usually allow cops at secret firehouse meetings, but, uh, I'll make an exception.
Mm. All right. Appreciate that.
Oh. Well.
You know, I ain't sold on you yet, but...
I think keeping me from getting shot deserves a second chance.
Hey, there won't be a third, though.
Buck here is having a little trouble moving on from a call that didn't go his way.
Oh. You know why they make us wear these uniforms, right?
Cops, firefighters, paramedics?
Mm-hmm.
So people can easily identify us.
Both true, but it's also for our own good.
Because when we take the uniform off at the end of the day, it symbolizes letting go of all of the sad, crazy, inhumane things we've seen that day.
I see his face every time I close my eyes.
That happen to you guys?
It'll pass.
Game over.
You coming, kid?
NEWS ANCHOR: Terror and heroism at the state fair.
Passengers trapped on a carnival ride gone haywire.
Our own Marcy Henderson got a few words with Evan "Buck" Buckley, the hero firefighter who risked his life climbing the broken ride.
BUCK: I reached out to pull him out the car.
He wouldn't give me his hand. I don't know what happened.
I-I don't know why he would do that.
NEWS ANCHOR: He's responsible for saving four lives on the ride...
MOM: Help.
Abby, help me.
What is it, Mom?
What is it?
MOM: Oh, I can't get out.
Yes, I guess, I guess...
Oh, Mom...
Did you lock the other one?
Coming in.
Mom, you cannot lock these doors.
I'm sorry, honey. I...
Can you, can you unlock it?
No, I don't know how to.
Well...
It's too dangerous. You cannot lock the door, Mom.
And I'm late for work.
Hi, I'm Carla from In-Home Services.
Is this the Clark residence?
Oh, my God. You're on time.
Yes, yes.
Come in, come in, come in.
Yeah. M-My mom locked herself in the bathroom.
Oh, you got to take the locks off the doors, except the front one -- you got to lock that from the outside.
Well, I haven't exactly had the chance to Alzheimer-proof the apartment.
Okay. It's okay.
It's okay. My husband's a handyman. We'll handle it.
Let's get her out of here first, okay?
Ms. Clark? Hi, my name is Carla Price.
It's very nice to meet you.
I need you to unlock this door for me.
MOM: I can't. I don't know how.
Okay, if you're on the floor, I need you to stand up and walk to the door.
MOM: I'm up.
Okay.
Take your right hand and put it on the doorknob and turn it.
MOM: Okay.
If that doesn't work, turn it the other way.
I'm okay.
Okay. All right, let's get you...
Let's get you in your chair.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Hi, I'm Carla. I'll be right in to give you a great foot rub.
Oh. Well, thank you.
You're welcome, ma'am.
All right.
Ma'am.
Great.
You go ahead.
You go ahead. I'm fine.
Uh-huh.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh.
I've never had anybody help me with her before.
Hey, what you're being asked to do is so hard.
It's like one long emergency, okay?
But I'm here to help now. This is what I do.
Do you want to move in?
I'm serious.
You can have my room.
Bring your family, bring your husband, whoever you got.
I'm gonna like working here.
But, look, go get your life back for a little while. I got this.
ATHENA: Come on, come on.
It's time to go.
Hey, Mom and I need to go to work, hustle up.
Hey, little man, you brush your teeth?
Yeah. Smell.
Ooh!
Hey, want a cup of coffee to go, babe?
No.
Harry, where's your sister?
She said she's sick. She's in bed.
Baby, when did you start feeling sick This morning.
Mm-hmm.
You got a test or something today that you're not ready for?
I said I'm sick.
Okay.
Why don't you get Harry to school, and, uh, I'll push my meetings back to this afternoon.
Get our little patient set up here for today.
You sure?
Yeah.
Thank you.
911, what's your emergency?
I need help...I'm being attacked in my house.
Get back! Get back!
Sir, I can barely hear you over your dogs.
Can you quiet them down?
No. No, I'm being attacked by devil dogs.
DISPATCH: Need all available units.
Please report to 673 Leland Way.
We have a canine attack in progress.
ATHENA: Eight-L-Thirty handling.
* No, I don't want to give you mine and *
* No, I don't want to meet you nowhere *
* No, I don't want none of your time and *
* No, I don't want no scrubs...*
ATHENA: This is an emergency.
I need you to back up.
* Hangin' out the passenger's side of his best friend's ride *
* Tryin' to holla at me * Oh, oh...
Hey, girl, give me four cheeseburgers and fries.
Put the fries in another bag, okay?
Oh, and a medium root beer.
MAN: Get out of here.
Go fetch.
Hey, hey!
Hey. Animal Control is on the way. Okay?
But in the meantime, I would stop spraying them with that.
It's just gonna piss them off.
What am I supposed to do?
Stand still, stand still.
The more activity they see, the more excited they're gonna get.
A-And don't look them in the eyes.
That's a challenge.
Yeah, yeah. I'm going to, uh...
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go see if, uh, I can find the owners.
And if you're thinking I'm a coward for letting you deal with these hellhounds on your own, uh, you are 100% correct.
I will, uh...
Ch...
Just-just stay calm. Stay still.
Hey. How big are they?
Take a look.
Oh, crap. Four bagger.
I was hoping to save one for lunch.
You ready?
I got your back.
You have a gun?
No, shooting them's just gonna piss 'em off.
I got something much more effective.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Got him.
Thank you.
You are a beautiful genius.
Is he okay?
Should be fine.
We'll have Animal Control test the dog for rabies.
You, uh, happen to, uh, notice what I noticed inside there?
There was fire, smoke.
What you talking about?
I'm talking about that sweet smile, them broad shoulders.
Mr. Sweet Smile was asking me about you.
Hmm. Then he a bigger dog than the Dobermans, 'cause I still have my ring on.
Athena. Spoiler alert: your husband likes boys, so that ring ain't gonna be on much longer.
Well...
for now, my vows still mean something to me.
And I-I couldn't do that to my kids.
This has been tough enough on them already.
I mean, I don't think May's said more than two words to Michael or I in the last week.
Whatever happens between you and Michael, these next few months are gonna be hell, so whatever you need to do to get through it so that you can be there for your kids and for yourself, you might want to do it.
Hen, when you got here, was that slide door open or closed?
Closed.
So was the front door.
Dogs can't get inside unless they live here.
What happened?
Um...uh...
What's going on, Officer?
Sir, is this your house?
Yeah, everything okay? What happened to my dogs?
Uh, the Dobermans?
You'll be happy to know they've been fed and they're safe.
The problem is, you've been burglarized, and I let him get away.
NEWSWOMAN: A sticky situation at an airport in Tennessee after baggage...
She's down. She should be out for a few hours.
Oh. Thank the Lord.
I'm a terrible person for saying that.
You're a good daughter because you choose to take care of her, not because of how you feel about it sometimes.
You want a glass of wine?
You've earned it.
Go get yourself a glass in the kitchen.
My husband and I are in a fight, so I can't go home until he moves from the "I never want to see her again" feeling to the "Oh, no, did I go too far, is she ever coming back?
I've got to treat her right when she comes home" feeling.
I like your style.
Thank you.
Hmm.
So, um, why are you not out with Tommy tonight?
Oh.
Your mom keeps telling me about him.
Oh. Because the universe thinks it's hilarious that I get to keep reliving the worst breakup of my life because my mother keeps forgetting that it happened.
What was so bad about it?
He broke up with me.
And he did not have my permission.
Hmm.
But I'll tell you the truth.
Really, once my mom moved in here...
I really didn't have anything else to give.
And what guy's gonna want to be here with me with my mom snoring in the other room?
I mean, it's not sexy.
NEWSMAN: ...with fireman Evan "Buck" Buckley, who people are calling the "County Fair Spider-Man" for his daring rescue.
Holy crap, he's gone national.
You know that big hunk of man meat?
Mm.
BUCK: I was just doing my job.
I'm happy we were able to help the people we helped and I'm-I'm really sorry about those we-we couldn't save.
NEWSWOMAN: Oh, we're getting a lot of Twitter questions from our audience. Most just want to know if you're single.
Oh, uh, that's, uh, that's very sweet of them, but, um, I'm sure they're just turned on by the uniform.
You know, I-I don't know if they would feel that way if they saw me out of it.
Oh, I-I don't mean it that way.
NEWSWOMAN: Well, thanks, Buck, and thanks for all you...
Hmm. He didn't answer the question.
You want an answer to the question?
All firemen are dogs.
And the ones that look like the Road Warrior with an adorable birthmark are the doggiest dogs of them all.
I've been thinking I might want to call him to see how he is.
Mm, or how he is about dating you?
No.
Mm-hmm.
He's a dog, you're a cougar. Own it.
Uh, no, it is not like that.
Look, you know what, I save people's lives every day, and he is the first person in years that actually has said, "Thank you, Abby, great job.
You're a hero, too." And...
he needs help, you know?
I mean, he's got so much pain in his face.
Everybody's treating him like a hero.
He doesn't feel like a hero.
As far as he's concerned, the guy that he was trying to save fell.
All right, well, go ahead on.
I'm not leaving until I hear how this turns out.
Oh, I don't know.
Call him.
Mm...?
Uh-huh.
You know you want to.
You just don't want to go home to your husband.
Not until he fixes his attitude.
Closing this door.
Yeah?
Um, hi. It's-it's Abby Clark.
We-we talked the other day after the home invasion.
I was the 911 operator.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were badass.
Uh, how'd you get this number?
Oh, well, it was in the report.
Um, but, anyway, I just, I don't know, I wanted to check on you.
I've been seeing you all over the news, and it seemed like maybe you were having a hard time.
Yeah, um, how'd you know?
Uh, in my job you kind of learn how to read people just based on the sound of their voice.
Thank you for noticing.
Um, everywhere I go now people are patting me on the back, and I just want to scream back at them, "You know, people died.
I had to watch them die." ABBY: I know.
I've had to listen to people die before.
The silence after they stop talking is like no other kind of quiet.
The guy who fell...
all he had to do was grab my hand, and I couldn't get him to.
You know, believe it or not, there are some people who actually take those moments as opportunities to make that decision.
I mean, there are some people who just don't want to be saved.
Um, thank you for calling me.
Maybe I can call you again sometime?
Yeah, that'd be great.
You have my number now or you can just dial 911.
All right, uh, well, thanks and let's talk soon.
Okay. Bye.
LIZ: My brother was a man of great potential.
That's the hardest part for me.
Thank you all for coming.
Hi. I'm, uh, I'm Buck, uh, Evan.
Look, I-I just wanted to say how sorry I am.
It's only my fourth month on the job.
I've never lost anyone before this.
What really happened up there?
It was like he just...
he gave up.
Are you saying it's my brother's fault he's dead?
No, th-that's not what I mean.
My brother was very h-happy to be alive.
He was loved, and he knew it.
He wanted to live, and you failed him.
* You know what sucks about working?
The work part.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't just say that.
I'm serious. Law school was a huge mistake.
We should just come up with an app or something.
I mean, if it hits, it is like winning the lottery.
Winning the lottery is not a life strategy, Stephanie.
Neither is writing briefs for a bunch of douches in suits defending pharmaceutical companies.
Your dad's the managing partner.
Yeah.
STEPHANIE: This guy is such a creep.
Who?
Him.
I'm pretty sure he took pictures of me in my office a couple months ago.
So gross.
Oh, my God, is he looking at me?
Can he see us?
Just act natural.
He's looking at me.
Look away.
911, what's your emergency?
He fell...oh my god, I can't believe this is happening.
He just, he fell!
Ok...take a breath. Who fell?
The, the pervy guy!
I'm sorry, did you say "pervy guy"?
The window washer, the thing snapped, his wires or whatever, and he's just hanging by his foot.
Tell me where you're calling from, ma'am.
All right, Buck, that rig could go any second.
I'm gonna go up to the roof and secure the cable, all right?
You go up on the ladder, get it up to him. Let's go.
Bob. Bob.
I'll go up to the roof. You know, I-I can get there quicker and make sure the, the cable is secure.
All right, good idea.
* Don't. All right? I-I know I let you down.
A year ago, I put in to be a Navy SEAL.
I didn't know you were in the Navy.
I wasn't.
Don't have to be in the Navy to try out for the SEALs.
You just have to be particularly badass, which you know...I am.
Didn't have any trouble with the physical part.
Following orders wasn't my best quality, but hey, I was working on it.
Why didn't it stick?
They wanted machines.
People who could, uh...flip a switch in their head and...turn off every natural, human instinctive emotion in their body, and I cannot do that.
I don't, I don't want to do that.
I love this job because I get to be the tough guy but I also get to help people.
Remember the first person you lost?
Katherine Vance -- 32 years old, blonde hair, green eyes.
She was wearing a blue University of Michigan T-shirt, white shorts, and she had on black Converse High Tops.
She had painted smiley faces on the toes.
Last thing she said to me was, "Please," and then she was gone.
Hit by a drunk driver -- I couldn't extract her in time.
I'm glad you can't...flip that switch.
I don't want you to.
It's not gonna make you a better firefighter.
And anybody who tells you that losing someone doesn't affect them is lying.
The name and number of a trauma counselor.
We have people in the department who help us deal with this kind of stuff.
You don't have to talk to me, but you do have to talk to someone.
* WELLES: You seem uncomfortable.
Yeah, I am a little.
Well, that's not unusual.
You've been through a trauma.
That's why you're here -- to deal with those feelings.
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, I'm not really into feelings.
I mean, I mean, feeling 'em, yeah, just not, you know...talking about them.
I treat a lot of first responders -- people who run toward danger -- but maybe there's something you're running from as well?
What is it about discussing your feelings that scares you?
I'm not scared.
I'm angry.
GLASS: That's good.
It's good?
It's good that you're expressing it.
Oh, yeah.
I'm expressing it.
BUCK: Look, I'm only here 'cause my captain insisted.
Yes. I understand you froze up at a scene the other day.
Yeah. Okay, I...I hesitated.
Why?
I just don't like...to be made to feel a fool, and that's exactly how I feel right about now.
Because you were right, Michael.
I did know.
Somewhere, not that deep down, I always knew you were gay.
But that's how badly I wanted to make a life with you.
A family.
And I'm not ready to let it go.
WELLES: You lost somebody.
That's hard.
Yeah, but we lose people.
At least that's what everyone keeps telling me.
Was this your first time?
I mean, I've had calls where it was...too late, but, uh, but I've only been doing this not even six months.
Now, I...I just can't shake the feeling that this one didn't need to go down the way that it did.
So do you think there was something you could have done differently?
You...are nobody's fool.
You are a strong, beautiful, loving woman.
Listen, I'm the fool.
I let you love me, because I thought you could fix me.
WELLES: Do you blame him?
I mean, he wouldn't take my hand.
Maybe he couldn't.
Maybe he was too paralyzed with fear, or confused or...
who knows?
Look...
I can't help you get inside his head, Mr. Buckley.
We're here to talk about what's inside yours.
It's, um...
it's actually just Buck.
Okay.
Um...can I ask you something?
Of course.
Did you friend me on Facebook?
I saw you on the news, um, before this was scheduled.
You should delete that.
Yeah, I thought you looked familiar.
Nobody is trying to take away your family, Athena.
Baby, we still got a whole lot to hold onto.
I agree.
And I'm willing to go down that road with you, Michael.
And what does that road look like to you, Athena?
I-I couldn't live with a loveless marriage.
Right.
But a sexless one?
Well, it's already been that for a while now, so I guess we're just at the point in our lives where...
we can live without it.
So if...you can live a celibate life, Michael, I can, too.
Uh...
* What?
Michael?
I met someone...
Athena.
I met someone.
Oh, God.
I can't believe I just did that.
I am so sorry.
Sorry.
You were fantastic.
That was beyond unprofessional.
I'm your therapist.
Yeah, and I feel better.
You need to go.
Now.
* MAN : Hello.
Hey, boo.
MAN: Who is this?
"Who is this?" Oh, come on now.
I'm disappointed in you.
I thought you and I had something.
I hate to disappoint, but you're gonna have to refresh my memory.
Yeah, well, I guess it has been a minute.
I was married.
You told me to call you when I needed a real man.
Well, here I am.
Well, here you are.
So, uh, you gonna come get this, huh?
Well, that depends on what you had in mind.
You can meet me at my place for a little afternoon delight, if you know what I'm saying.
Afternoon delight?
Girl, you need to update your euphemisms.
Okay, okay, where you at?
Mmm, I'm not far.
How do you know?
You like dogs?
Dobermans?
I have one at my place.
Who is this?
How did you get this number?
You called 911, dumb ass.
No, no, no, no.
You think you can just make me look like a fool and walk away Sergeant Grant, easy!
Easy.
911, what's your emergency?
Yo, you better get somebody down here quick, yo.
This dude is gonna jump from, like, I don't even know how high.
Ok, sir, where are you calling from?
How high you think that is man? What floor?
Twentieth floor?
Twentieth? No way. He's higher than that.
Sir. Sir? Sir!
One, two, three --
You start with two, right?
Sir, please stop.
So, two, three, four,
Please stop counting.
And tell me where you're calling from.
WOMAN: Leonard!
Will you please just get the hell down from there?
Okay, you're scaring me.
LEONARD: After all that I do for you?
I do whatever you tell me to!
WOMAN: That's part of the problem, Leonard!
And then you go and cheat on me with some werewolf-looking dick from work?
I did not cheat on you, okay?
How many times do I have to say this?!
You need to say it more because I do not believe you.
Seriously? It's got to be a jumper?
He couldn't threaten himself with a gun?
Right. 'Cause that would be preferable.
OFFICER : Bedroom door is locked.
The girlfriend is on the living room balcony.
We're gonna have to do The Maneuver.
Oh, Bobby, no, I...
Yes.
I'll do it.
No, Buck's got this.
You got this.
Why did you move in if I am so terrible?
You're not that terrible. Will you please get down so we can talk about how you can improve?
I don't think I need to improve.
Fine. You want to jump?
Go ahead and jump!
I don't even know what to say to him anymore.
Telling him to jump is probably not the way to go.
He will not listen to me, okay?
He's convinced that I cheated on him, and we keep going in circles.
Don't you dare do that, I swear to God!
Did you cheat on him?
This is the right time for that?
So, that's a yes.
No, it isn't.
Just tell him you're sorry.
Absolutely not.
Okay, I'm not gonna admit that I cheated on him.
It doesn't have to be true.
He just needs to hear that you're sorry.
All right?
Fine. Leonard?
I'm sorry.
Okay, I don't know what I was thinking.
I love you and only you.
You lying bitch.
Oh, fine!
I mean, that was pathetic.
Oh, come on, I tried my best.
Hey. Leonard, listen to me.
We've all been there, man.
I had a girlfriend cheat on me and...
I thought she was the one, Leonard.
I saw us going the whole way.
Marriage, kids, all of it.
So I went out and I bought her a ring, a nice one.
I mean, we were on top of the Eiffel Tower.
I got down on one knee.
I popped the question.
Everybody staring at us.
She had tears in her eyes.
You know what she said to me?
Now.
She says to me, "Bobby..." The girl, on the Eiffel Tower.
I don't know. We never get that far in the story.
Hey, Bobby, um...
thanks for pushing me back there.
I don't know what happened.
I guess I had a moment.
You bounced back and saved a man's life.
You did good, kid.
Five bucks says that guy's getting laid tonight.
A guy ready to kill himself, and you think his girlfriend is turned on?
He was punishing her for cheating.
Guilt sex. Help me out here, Buck.
I need to apologize to you.
I was completely out of line at the memorial.
You didn't deserve that.
You lost your brother.
I get it.
Seven years ago, Devon tried to kill himself.
We sent him to therapy and he got better.
Then, two months ago, he started isolating himself again.
Wouldn't leave the house.
I got scared and called his friend, Chad.
Begged him to get Devon out of the house.
Chad said he'd ask Devon to go to the state fair.
When Devon said yes to the fair, I took it as a sign that he was getting better.
So, you see, it's not your fault he's dead.
It's mine.
Look, there was nothing either one of us could've done for Devon.
Some people just don't want to be saved.
A friend said that to me recently.
And, um...it helped.
MOM: Mmm.
ABBY: Well, this is nice.
We don't get to go out very often, do we, Mom?
Mm-mm. Carla got me all dolled up.
Yes, yes, I did.
Mm.
CARLA: It's good to get different kinds of stimulation.
Releases that serotonin, that happy hormone.
Well, we could all use a little happy hormone.
Abby, you're in the prime of your life, girl.
You need to get out and have some fun.
You need to ask out that fireman that looks like he got punched in the eye.
I'm not asking out that fireman.
He's way too young for me.
Girl, you are a hot spice pumpkin latte.
You're sitting around, getting cool, and there's a big old hunk of man that would love to burn his tongue on you.
Oh.
Mm.
Call him.
You're so pushy.
Mm-hmm.
But you like it.
Okay, I'll be back.
Wait, I want to hear this.
No.
Hello.
Hey. Buck, it's, uh, it's Abby Clark.
Ah, hey.
Hey. How you doing?
I'm good. Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Oh, my God, why?
'Cause you keep calling me.
People don't use their phones to make calls anymore.
You know, we text, we Snap or we Marco Polo, or if it's really serious, then we FaceTime.
I guess that's true, I know I'm...
sorry, I just, you know, I spend so much time on the phone.
I guess it's my most comfortable form of communication.
Nah, don't be sorry. I like it.
It's, um, it's old-fashioned.
Yes, well, um...
I have another old-fashioned idea, which is that I was thinking maybe we could...
meet up in person over some old-fashioned margaritas.
Ah, see, where I'm from, they, uh, they call that a date.
Yeah.
They call it a date where I'm from, too.
I'm asking you out on a date.
Um, I mean, that sounds really fun.
You're-you're super smart and funny and obviously killer at your job, um, but I'm-I'm realizing that I have some issues when it comes to women and intimacy.
And if, uh, if we went out on a date, I'm pretty sure we'd have sex.
Uh, okay.
You think I would just sleep with you?
I'm not sure what to make of that.
No, look, it's, um, it's not you, it's, it's not you, it's me.
Um, look, I have issues.
For example, I just slept with my therapist in our first session.
It's kind of like I'm a magnet.
Oh, so you think I'm not gonna be able to control myself around you?
Because, right now, I mean, in this conversation, I'm extremely not interested in sleeping with you, so...
I won't go out with you because I like you.
'Cause I know we've only talked a couple times, but talking to you makes me feel really good and safe and curious about life because I can tell that you're special.
And I don't have anyone like you in my life and I don't want to do anything to risk losing you.
For now I think it's best if we just talk on the phone, like in the olden days.
I'd be into that.
That would be great.
All right, well, then I'll talk to you soon.
Bye, Buck.
Good-bye, Abby.
He said no.
CARLA: Then why are you smiling?
Because I had the nerve to call the guy.
And sometimes the right kind of no is better than the wrong kind of yes.
I like that.
Hey, baby.
How was your day?
Mm.
Great.
Good.
Oh. Dad called.
He said we could eat dinner without him.
I'll bet he did.
Where's your sister?
In her room.
Ooh. May!
Honey, you hungry?
May, honey, have you eaten anything?
Damn headphones with that music up so loud.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
May. May. Oh, God.
911, what's your emergency?
It's my daughter...
she just overdosed, I think she's...
I...I think she's dead.
 @@@@@@
JOSH: Compensate much?
Ah, he only turns ten once.
And what ten-year-old doesn't want a sushi chef at his birthday party?
Cam!
Eh, maybe I'm overcompensating a little bit.
He's dealing with a lot lately.
Man, this wind is awful, huh?
JOSH: Santa Anas.
Makes my allergies go crazy.
Cam! You having fun?
His mother's turning him against me. Undermining.
I told you to give her more in the divorce settlement.
That money pays her to be cool.
This wind. Dan, do you mind holding your son?
Excuse me.
Danny!
Coming in!
Dad, you-you're too big.
Ah!
Come on!
Yeah!
Yeah.
 Whoa!
Want more?
We do!
Yeah.
Whoa.
DAN: Cameron!
Cam!
911, what's your emergency?
Our bouncy house just took off a hundred feet in the air!
One of those big blow-up houses for kids' parties?
Yes! You have to come now.
There are children still inside of it. My stepson is in it!
My husband got thrown.
Oh my god, I don't know if he's dead!
Where is the bouncy house now, ma'am?
It crashed into the hill.
It's hanging, like, from the side of the cliff!
Please come quickly! Please, please!
HEN: Adult male, down, on the hillside.
We got three kids in a bouncy house.
All right, we're gonna stage the trucks on that service road.
Hen, I want you and Buck to rappel down, anchor that bouncy house.
Assess the condition of those kids, start to send them down one-by-one in a basket. I'll take care of the dad.
Chimney, you're gonna stay up here and work the winch.
Hey. How come I never get to do any of the fun stuff?
Working the winch is fun.
HEN: Bouncy house secure, Chim.
Copy.
Help!
Hey, guys? Hey! Hey, guys, we're...
We're L. A. Fire and Rescue. We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Everybody, just stay calm.
HEN: Hey, boys, can you tell if your friend here is okay?
Is he awake?
BUCK: Lower the basket down, Chim.
Copy.
Is my dad okay?
DAN: Cameron...
Sir.
Sir, do not move your head.
Stay still. We'll get you out of here as soon as we can.
DAN: Cameron...
BUCK: Chim, little lower.
Copy.
Boys, come on, let's go. Now.
BUCK: All right, that's it. Nice and easy, nice and easy.
All right, basket coming in, Hen.
Hen's going down. She's got one kid, come on.
All right.
Chim, we're good. Take me down.
BP and heart rate stable.
Vitals are stable.
Dad?
Dad!
Dan!
I thought you were dead.
I'm okay, Cam.
We're both okay.
Love you so much.
I love you so much, too.
It's okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Had us worried, there.
We're good down here.
You can pack it up topside.
Nice work at the winch.
Thanks.
911, what's your emergency?
It's my daughter...she just overdosed.
I think she's...I think she's dead.
May. May. May. Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Wake up.
May!
Mom. Mom!
What's wrong with May?
Honey. Honey, honey, honey.
Your sister isn't feeling well, okay?
I need you to go next door to the Johnsons.
Call your father, tell him to meet me at the hospital, okay?
Yeah.
All right. Lock the door.
I have to go and ride with your sister.
Pulse is weak and thready. What did she take?
Uh...hydrocodone.
Uh, do you know how many pills she took, the dosage?
They were mine from last year. I had some dental work done but didn't finish the bottle.
Maybe six or seven were left, I-I-I don't know.
Pupils aren't responding.
She's a six on the GCS, fading.
Oh...
Mommy's right here, baby.
It's okay. I'm right here.
Can you hear me?
Stay with me. Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.
They're gonna take good care of you.
You be strong for me now, okay?
(woman speaks indistinctly over P. A.) Athena. What's up? You're not answering your phone.
I-I rushed out so fast, I forgot it.
Okay, well, what happened?
She took a bunch of pills.
On purpose? Well, what did she take?
Hydrocodone.
Okay, can...
No...she's still in ICU.
They said maybe half an hour or so.
I need to sit down.
Ah...
Oh, God, this is my fault.
You were right, you were...you were right.
I shouldn't have told them.
They weren't ready.
Did she seem this upset to you?
I mean, I-I know it's...hard.
But this hard?
When is the last time we didn't know exactly what May was feeling?
Sh -- well, she's a teenager now.
I-I just, you know, maybe we weren't, uh, paying enough attention.
I just -- I don't know, but...
Okay, all right, let's-let's not do this right now, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
H Uh...we...
we were having dinner, and he...and-and he drove me here.
I'm sorry. He was...he was just worried about me.
Uh...
I-I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.
Yeah, okay.
*
* The last time she was in a hospital bed, I was lying in it with her, feeding her.
Yeah. It was just an hour and a half of labor.
We almost didn't make it to the hospital.
She was so damn eager to get into this world.
MAY: Mom?
Baby. Hey.
Dad's here, too.
Hey, sweetheart.
I'm sorry. I was stupid.
No, you're not stupid, honey.
You're a young girl.
Being young is hard, honey.
MICHAEL: And I'm the one that should be sorry.
I didn't see how much you were suffering with all of the stuff at home.
About me.
This wasn't because of you, Daddy.
Things have been going on.
I didn't want to tell you about them, because I was trying to handle it by myself.
What kind of things, honey?
A boy?
No.
Bunch of girls.
Mostly this one, Layla.
I don't know why they chose me.
I think because I was talking to a boy she likes, and they decided to gang up on me.
And they kept saying "you're nothing" and "you're the worst" and "you should go kill yourself" and "no one would care if you did" and "you should die."
You know none of that is true, don't you, honey?
You are a special, bright light in the world.
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm.
No, I'm not.
You guys got to say that 'cause you're my parents.
I hate my life.
I'm weird. I have no friends.
What about Georgina You two are thick as thieves, now.
Not anymore.
She's with Layla now.
I didn't want to die.
It hurt so much, but I swear I didn't want to die.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Now, you listen to me.
You're strong, you're courageous, you're a champion, and you are May Grant.
And you are filled with holy fire, and no one messes with you.
No, you're not alone anymore.
And those girls?
They done picked the wrong family.
The wrong family.
WOMAN: Excuse me. Mr. and Mrs. Grant?
I'm Karen Williams.
I work for Child Protective Services.
I'm going to have to ask you not to say anything else in your daughter's presence.
MICHAEL: Athena, what is this?
When a child attempts suicide, then they need to go through an independent assessment protocol to determine why, and if they're at risk to try it again.
Okay, but we can tell you what the cause is.
No, they need to talk to her alone, find out if it had anything to do with us.
WILLIAMS: She will be admitted tonight, put on 24-hour watch, and evaluated in the morning.
MAY: I don't want to stay here.
I want to go home!
Shh...
WILLIAMS: The evaluation may take a couple of days, but we will notify you if we have to move her, and what facility she will be housed in.
You listen.
This girl just endured a life-altering trauma.
She needs to be home with her family.
Look, you don't need to do this.
You're a police officer.
You know what I'm authorized to do if you don't let me do my job.
Mama, please.
Please don't leave me.
All right.
Don't go.
Look, look, look, calm down.
All right, we all have to follow the rules.
They...they just want to find out that you're okay.
All right? Now, you tell them everything, you understand?
You're safe, and you'll be home with us in no time.
Can you be brave for me?
All right, I need you to be braver than you've ever been.
All right. That's my girl.
That's my girl. Love you.
All right, I love you.
I love you, too.
MICHAEL: I love you, baby.
* This is not right!
It's just not right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Michael.
Now, look, my family is everything to me.
And there ain't no trouble from the inside, or even from the outside, that's gonna tear it apart.
Now, we may be buried in it up to our necks right now, and I may want to slap you with my left hand, but my right hand is holding you and the kids tight.
Now, I'm gonna make a couple of calls to some cops I know down at the CPS facility where they're taking May.
She's gonna be okay.
Come on, let's go.
Home.
Together.
* Hey, uh, Tatiana?
Do not come in here, okay?
Not while I'm cooking, please.
I kind of have this thing when I'm cooking, if somebody's watching me.
You know, I kind of get stage fright, so...
Listen, babe, you do not have to convince me not to move while somebody else does all the work.
And it smells really good.
Oh. Thank you.
Oh.
I saw the videos of that jumpy house flying through the air on the news. I cannot believe anybody survived that.
Oh, yeah, me neither.
TATIANA: Yeah.
You know, uh, when we were rappelling down to, uh, anchor the house and assess the condition of the kids, we were pretty sure we were gonna find a body or two in there.
Is it terrible that the phrase "when we were rappelling down" turns me on so much?
And dinner is served.
("Fade into You" by Mazzy Star playing) Well, you cook...you rappel down cliffs.
Mm-hmm.
You're a keeper, Chimney.
* I wanna take a breath...
Well, then, I think you will like what I have for dessert.
Ooh.
* And I see nothing...
Tatiana, I love you.
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Will you please marry me?
* You go in shadows...
Chimney, it's beautiful.
And you are a beautiful man.
* And you'll go blind...*
I can't tell if that's a yes.
It's not.
But it's not a no, I just...
I wasn't prepared for this at all.
Okay, it's just, it's such a surprise.
* Colors your eyes...
I-I thought this was what you wanted.
You should've asked me before you did this.
You wanted me to ask you to ask you to marry me?
I don't...
I was engaged before.
I cheated on him a week before the wedding.
I have issues with commitment.
And I just want to be really, really sure, so that I don't hurt you like I hurt Ted.
St -- wait, wait, whoa, wait, wait.
So-so, so you were engaged before?
Look, if I say no, we have to break up.
A relationship can't handle a rejection like that.
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, uh...
All that I'm really asking you to do is to just keep doing what we're doing.
Which you love.
For the rest of our lives, it-it's really -- it's not that complicated.
Just...give me a few days.
Of course.
Y-Yes.
Sure, of course.
HEN: Right here, right here, right here.
Turn left!
BUCK: I'm trying!
Oh, oh, so you're fleeing the scene?
You do realize that you lose points for murdering people on the way to a fire.
It should be fine.
It's a flesh wound. Obamacare.
What?
What? Hen! Please -- someone call HR! No -- Hen!
Ridic...Chimney!
Here. You're up.
BUCK: Aw, man.
HEN: Hey. What's...
what's wrong Look, Chim, if there's something you want to talk about...
I'm a good I mean, like, you can do a lot worse than me Chimney, I've done a whole lot worse than you.
Buck.
You think I'd be a good father?
Of course, Chim.
What is this about?
I asked Tatiana to marry me.
What?
HEN: Um...
CHIMNEY: First, she said she cheated on a fiancé that I didn't even know about, and that now we need to break up, then she said she didn't know. I...
Did you offer her the option of an open marriage?
It's super modern.
Buck.
Chim...
I'm sorry.
That may not have been the response you that you hoped for, but it's not no.
It might as well be.
Probably for the best.
What was that?
Nothing. I'm sorry.
I...I didn't mean anything by that. You doing okay?
Of course you meant something by it. "Probably for the best"?
There's a lot of meaning behind that.
What, you don't...you don't like her?
I never said I don't like her.
I don't like her for you.
CHIMNEY: And what does that even mean?
No. Come on. Come on with it, wise man, uh -- just say what you want to say, 'cause I'm getting real tired of you standing there, just silently judging me with that -- yeah, right there, with that smirk on your face.
You know, you're always so quick...
Chim.
to comment on everybody's life, but you completely shut down whenever we ask you about yours.
Why is that I mean, how long have we worked together, Bobby?
I know nothing about you.
I've never even met your wife and your kids.
You know why? 'Cause all you do is you sit there, brooding, staring in that little book of yours.
You know what? You're upset, let's drop it.
Oh, my God, Bobby. Come on, just say it! What is it?
Say it!
All right, you're living a lie, man!
You let her manipulate you.
You pretend to be somebody you're not when you're around her.
Making up stories to satisfy some hero fetish of hers? What is that?
You know what? Maybe I wouldn't have to make up stories if every once in a while, you let me take point on something.
I have to operate the winch, right?
And The Maneuver? I can do The Maneuver.
BOBBY: I know you can. That's not the point here.
Chimney, this relationship that you're in is fueled by lies.
Come on.
Y-You asked me to make you two dinner so you could pass it off as your own.
She's not in love with you.
She's in love with this fantasy version of you.
You know what? I feel real bad for your wife.
I really do.
Must be tough living with someone who thinks he's right all the time.
Chim.
I'm getting some air.
* Woman, you know, woman * You gotta be, woman * I've got the feeling of love * When you're talking to me * See right through me * I've got the feeling of alone...*
Call Tatiana.
TATIANA: You've reached Tatiana. Please leave a message.
* She's gonna set you free * Yeah, yeah Come on.
* You've come looking for me * Like I've got to set you free *
* You know I can't free nobody * Like I've got to set you free *
* I can't be nobody Oh, my!
911, what's your emergency?
Can you...I'm in my car.
Sir, I can't understand you.Could you speak louder please?
Send help...
I was in a car accident.
Hello.
Who is this?
Okay.
All right, everybody, let's gear up!
Let's go, let's go!
For what? I didn't hear a bell.
It's Chimney.
Come on. Hustle up. Hustle up, everybody, let's go!
MAN : Ladder medic, 10-36, auto emergency.
Captain Nash.
Yeah. Thanks for calling.
Your guy's this way.
He wouldn't let anyone else touch him.
You, uh...you might want to prepare yourself, sir.
Hang back, guys.
Can I get in there?
Hey, Chim.
Bobby, I...can't move my neck.
He's alert and talking, doesn't appear to be in any pain.
Got a piece of rebar through his skull.
How is that even possible?
Oh, it's possible. Brain tissue has no nociceptors.
It can't feel pain.
Okay, what about the rest of his head?
Well, he's in shock.
Now, listen guys, this hasn't registered yet.
He knows he's pinned, but that's it, so we got to be cool.
So if this thing's right between his eyes, can he see it?
I don't know what he can see.
Airways sound good.
Not much pain.
Uh...I don't think there's any spinal damage.
I can feel my legs, but when I try and move my head...
HEN AND BUCK: Don't.
BOBBY: Be still.
Wh-Wh-Why aren't you guys, like, cutting me out of here?
It's complicated.
You've been injured, Chim.
It's not good.
Well, I want to see it.
No, you don't.
Yeah, I do. Bobby, show me.
All right.
Are you ready?
Show it to me.
All right.
Holy crap.
How come I'm not dead?
Because you are the luckiest and the unluckiest son of a bitch on the face of the earth all at the same time.
Hey, uh, you guys, I can't even feel this.
I know.
All right, well, please get me out of here before I start to...
All right, we're working on it.
Normally, I'd be consulting with my smartest EMT, but right now he's got a rebar stuck in his head.
Nice and tight, right? All right.
Yeah.
BOBBY: All right, can you move?
Not a bit.
Good. All right, Buck.
CHIMNEY: Hey, Buck.
How's the car, man? Is it a total loss?
Nah, man, you...probably buff most of that out.
Good.
Good.
Let's get O. R. 3 prepped for a decompressive hemicraniotomy.
We'll take him from here.
Wha...No, w-we're not leaving his side.
Are you family?
Buck, our job ends here at these doors like always.
* Oh, it's on too tight.
Hmm.
What is...
That's the perfume you like.
But I don't wear perfume.
Oh, sure you do, Pat.
You always smell wonderful.
Look, Mom.
See? It's your favorite one. Sniff.
Oh...
Is...someone having a birthday?
I got it. I got it.
Okay.
She seems a little cantankerous today.
I know.
She's not always like that. I think, you know, big event like this...
it's a little overwhelming for her.
You look tired, Abby.
Oh my -- shut up.
Well...
That's a very rude thing to say to a woman.
Didn't mean it...
That's rude.
I'm -- I-I am worried about you.
Don't...
She's only gonna get worse, you know.
I mean, i-it's progressive.
Yes, I'm familiar with what happens with Alzheimer's.
I've done the reading.
Yeah, well.
Read this.
It's a brochure for a memory care facility.
I put Mom's name on a list, and a room has opened up.
You put her on a list for a memory care facility without asking me?
Because I knew what you would say.
You don't know what I was gonna say.
"I can handle this, Matt."
Well, I can handle it, Matt.
And I know you can and you have been, and I don't tell you enough, but you are a saint for doing it.
I'm not a saint. I'm a daughter.
A saintly daughter.
Oh, come on.
Who got the short end of the stick because you're not married, you don't have any kids.
It's not fair.
Oh, my God.
Stop it. No. It's because I made a choice that I want to take care of my mother. Okay?
And-and I've never complained about it, not once.
Saints don't complain. They suffer.
I'm not suffering.
This is my choice. It's important to me.
And, you know, I have the means.
I have a really good job, she gets benefits, you help out.
We're doing this.
We're fine.
But are you living?
Matt.
I mean it, Abby. It's just...
You had something with Tommy before.
And ever since Mom has been here, you've been alone.
You got to start thinking about yourself.
And Mom's gonna need a facility like this at some point.
Just take a tour. That's all I'm asking.
BUCK: It's been, like, 14 hours.
How long's it take to pull a rod out of a guy's skull, anyway?
You ever heard of that saying, "It ain't brain surgery"?
Well, this is.
What's 3 across for when doubled in...?
Just got off the phone with the surgeon.
He's alive.
Yeah.
Any...a There were some complications when they took the rebar out.
He started hemorrhaging.
They got the bleeding under control, but had to put him in a medically induced coma.
They'll let us know if his condition changes.
You mean if he wakes up.
Or if he doesn't.
Yeah.
911, what's your emergency?
Uh, there are people trapped in the back of a truck.
I can hear them screaming.
What's your location, ma'am?
I'm at the warehouse parking lot on Colorado. There's no driver and the doors are locked.
I don't think they can breathe.
Buck, get the tools.
Yo, Hen.
Is it wrong I was stoked there was an emergency?
I was climbing the walls back at the house.
We all were, and, yeah, it's wrong.
We're not here to blow off steam. We're here to help.
Truck is registered out of Texas.
We're still looking for the driver.
It's got to be over 100 degrees in there.
Buck!
(knocking, people speaking indistinctly) *
BOBBY: All right, get these people some water.
I got him, I got him, I got him.
BOBBY: All right, get these people some water, come on.
Put it down. Hen.
BOBBY: All right, this is truck 118.
I'm gonna need as many ambulances as we can.
Hurry up, come on.
Chopper, too.
We may have to medevac a few of them.
It's at least four and a half hours to the Mexican border, if that's even where they started.
BUCK: Come on.
Ah, breathe.
Starting compressions.
Go ahead.
OFFICER: Get down, all right, take it easy.
All right, come on. I know you can hear me.
I need you to breathe for me, okay Can you stand up? Take my hand.
Take my hand. Ready?
All right, go, go, go.
Start helping 'em down, come on.
Por favor, mijo.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
All right, give me something.
Ah!
Javi, Javi, good job, good job.
Uh, uh...to-to-todo bien, todo bien. All right?
BUCK: Here we go, here we go, here we go.
There you go.
BUCK: Here we go, here we go, that's it.
OFFICER: Do me a favor, please, please...
Hey!
Dick! Where the hell do you think you're going?
Sick son of a bitch.
Whole families could have died in there.
Someone with a badge and a gun want to put this trash in custody?
Ooh, that was badass, but I thought we weren't here to blow off steam.
You know what you can blow.
Hen.
Hey, uh, everything okay?
ABBY: You answered. You always answer.
You're so sweet.
Oh, no, everything's fine.
Um, is this a bad time?
Uh, no. I'm-I'm at a call, but I-I wanted to answer and, you know, make sure...
you're not out on the ledge or something.
Thank you.
I can't believe you're at a call.
Um, I'm not on a ledge.
But I'm in a windowsill.
You're on a call.
I'm letting you go. Go back to work.
We can talk later.
Nah, come on, tell me.
No, it's just my mom.
My mom has Alzheimer's, did I tell you that? I can't remember if I told you that or not.
No, I, uh, I didn't know that.
Sorry.
Um, thanks.
And she's just...slipping, you know?
She's getting worse, and I...
I'm starting to feel like she might need more...than just me.
More help. Professional help.
Y Yeah. Although even as you say it out loud, I'm paralyzed with guilt at the thought of it.
I mean, she's my mom. Right?
Yeah, that's rough.
Look, I don't...I don't know a lot.
But if there's one thing I learned over the last 24 hours, the only thing that matters is family.
Right.
Yes.
You're so right.
Thank you.
Yeah, you got it.
Um...
Look, I'll talk to you soon. Okay?
Tatiana. I'm Bobby.
We spoke on the phone.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Now I know why Chimney always calls you Gary Cooper.
I see you've had some visitors.
Yeah.
All day and last night, too.
Is that normal, or is Chimney just really popular?
Firefighters are a brotherhood.
Cops are the same way.
One of us goes down, we make sure the family's looked after.
And I'm the family?
I was hoping to convince you to come to the hospital to visit him.
I thought you said that he wasn't awake.
They're bringing him out of his coma now.
It'd be good if you were there.
He asked me to marry him.
I know.
It's not right, you know.
Putting me in that kind of situation.
Either I say yes or I'm some kind of monster.
You don't have to say yes.
You just have to come hold his hand.
This is not about love, it's about decency.
That's my point.
Anything I do now that isn't being Florence Nightingale, it makes me look like some kind of jerk.
So, I hold his hand when he wakes up.
Then it's stay with him until he's out of the hospital.
And then it's you can't break up with him until he can walk or talk again, and that's assuming that he ever can.
And you want me to just play like I'm in love for how long?
A month.
I am not a bad person.
I am just not in love with him.
Tatiana.
My friend is coming out of a medically induced coma.
I don't know if he'll ever fully wake up.
And if he does, I don't know if he's gonna be able to talk or see or hear or even remember who I am.
I am not asking you to love him or marry him, and I'm not judging you for your feelings. I'm not.
I'm just saying he loves you.
Misguided as he may be.
And the only two things I can think of to help him are to pray and to hope that if you're with him, he'll feel that love for you and it will give him a reason to fight his way back to us.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
ABBY: Okay.
Um, she's had her midday pills, except I think I might have used next week's day-of-the-week box by accident.
Would you mind just checking on that?
We'll get it squared away.
Thank you.
Am I about to be out of a job?
Oh.
No. My brother left that.
Oh. Oh.
This is a good place.
Mm-hmm.
Vacancies are rare.
Huh.
Are you considering it?
I was for a minute.
But then I thought, you know, as long as my mom is still here with me...
I want her to be here with me.
We're going, we're going.
He's a tough nut.
He's gonna be in this room for a few days.
Intubation tube is out, obviously, but the catheter's still in.
Can he hear us?
I always treat them like they can.
All right, two minutes, and then I'm kicking you out.
Hey, Chim.
We're all here for you, buddy.
H-Hey.
I-I was thinking maybe when you come back to work, um, you know, you should do The Maneuver instead of me.
To motivate him to get better.
He can't do The Maneuver.
Yeah, he can.
Hey, Chim, you can do The Maneuver.
Right?
Chim.
I, um...
I tried to get ahold of your parents.
There's a 16-hour time difference with Seoul, you know, so maybe...
maybe that has something to do with it.
BOBBY: Yeah, it's all right.
His family's right here.
Please don't ever let him do The Maneuver.
@@@@@@
In preparation for landing, the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign.
Please return your tray table and seat back to its full upright and locked position.
Can I put your bag up?
GIRL: Yeah.
Okay.
I like your monkey.
RICHARD: Babe, babe? Can I get another 7 and 7?
Uh, we're landing. You need to put your laptop away.
Babe.
And don't call me "babe."
RICHARD: Come on, it was a joke.
JANE: Well, apologize.
Thank you.
Hey, on behalf of all men, I'd like to apologize as well.
Seat back all the way up.
Yeah.
Does it count if we're not actually a mile high?
Yes, it counts. Now flight attendants will be too busy getting everything ready to notice. Come on.
TAMMY: How about...movie and dinner?
JAKE: That feels too serious.
Oh. Then how about a movie and donuts?
He's going on his first date.
Wow! Major.

Is it the jack of spades?
Yes! How did you do that?

Brace yourselves for emergency landing!
Really?
If you want some, just ask.
I'm good. I already ate.
You still owe me 20 bucks, Buck.
Don't think I'm-a forget.
For the damn cookie bouquet, that I delivered to Chimney.
The one with the get well card that I personally watched you sign.
BUCK: He's doing it again.
What Staring into that book.
Come on, you must have a line on the gossip around here.
What is it? Why-why is he so obsessed with it?
HEN: Mm-mm. All I'm gonna tell you about that book is to stay the hell away from it.
Trust me.
I made that mistake three months into working here.
So you're saying no one here knows what he writes in it.
Well, watch this.
All right, Buck. When he pops you in that pretty face, just make sure it's on the side that's already got a mark.
So, Bobby, I got to ask.
What's the deal with that book?
It's none of your business.
I know it's a list of people you saved, all right?
Right now, there are 46 names in it.
But there's space for 148. Why that number?
You read my book?
I mean, I-I peeked once or twi...
Don't ever do that again.
911, what's your emergency?
I'm on a plane, and something happened to the engine and everything is --
Oh my god, everything is flying everywhere.
I'm sorry. You're on a train?
A plane! Oh my god, we're too close to those buildings.
Oh my god, we're too close...
Hello? Ma'am?
You guys ever seen something like this before?
* Captain Nash. Who's got incident command?
WALLY: You do now, Captain. It looks like the plane split in two on impact.
BOBBY: All right, I'm gonna need you to be my point man on the beach. All right, Hen, I need you to check on the Coast Guard chopper.
And, Buck, I need you to check with the dive team, all right?
BUCK: We got at least 20.
Hey, Buck.
Just keep moving, Buck.

You know she's having a house party.
4:00 on a school day. House party.
MICHAEL: What are you even doing there, Athena?
This will not convince Social Services to let May come home.
You're out of your mind.
No. I'm a police officer doing my job.

Hello, Officer. Is there a problem or something?
Your neighbors called to complain.
I'm sorry. Was the music too loud?
No, it's the smell they were objecting to.
Officer, I promise you, no one here is smoking marijuana.
Mm. Did I say "marijuana"?
No, I don't believe I did.
No, see, they called to say some skanky teenage ho living up in here, bringing a real stank to the neighborhood.
Bringing down the property values and such.
I'm-a have to guess that'll be you.
Excuse me?
Georgina Turner, where the hell you think you're going?
Uh, hi, Sergeant Grant.
"Sergeant" You've spent the night at my house, eaten at my table.
We go way back.
Go on. Tell 'em, Georgina.
She's May Grant's mom.
My baby was in the hospital because of you.
She nearly died. What do you have to say to that?
Good.
She's a punk-ass slut.
You're under arrest.
You can't do that!
I saw what you hid in your bag.
Huh?
Hmm.
Party's over.
You are in such trouble.
My father's an attorney.
Tax attorney.
Ms. Grant?
Could you tell May I'm sorry?
You should tell her yourself.
(indistinct police radio chatter) Where's my daughter?
Laila.
OFFICER: Hey, hey, hey!
Laila. Oh, my God. Let go of me!
Hey, hey!
Get your hands off my wife!
Oh, you. Grant.
Or whatever your name is. You did this?
Mrs. Creedy, you need to calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down.
I get a call from my daughter's friends saying that you barge into our home and start blaming Laila for what happened to your daughter.
The hell is the matter with you?
What's she being charged with?
Possession of a controlled substance.
I want her released. Now.
I play golf with a top trial attorney, and he's gonna have a field day with this case.
Your daughter's going through the system like everyone else.
Was this about revenge? Is that it?
You-you got it in your head that Laila is somehow to blame for your daughter trying to kill herself?
Don't you talk about my daughter.
You should've come to us if you had concerns.
What, like the other parents who complained to you about Satan over there?
Yeah, that's right. I talked to them.
And I know you did nothing -- not a single damn thing.
Nada.
Yeah, all right, I've heard enough about what you think...
You want to know why your daughter's sitting in that cell?
You failed.
Your daughter is a nightmare because the two of you are a nightmare.
Now get the hell out of my station.
OFFICER: 1178, Dockweiler Beach.
Laila.

OFFICER: No stopping here! Keep it moving, keep it moving!
No stopping here!
Sergeant, thank you. Really appreciate it.
Captain Dowers, airport security.
DOWERS: Well, it went down just off Dockweiler into the water.
We got departures grounded on the taxiways.
Arrivals with no gates.
Got air traffic control and NTSB up my ass.
My guys are spread all over hell trying to keep this place on lockdown till we can figure out what's going on.
I just hope to God it isn't a...isn't a bomb or ISIS or whatever.
I know that emergency manual cold, but nothing prepares you for this.
All right, just breathe.
LAPD is here and ready to assist.
All right, listen, I'm-I'm...it's gonna take some time for us to get things moving.
Excuse me.
Excuse us.
Yeah.
Do you have any information about the accident?
They're not telling us a thing, and I'm looking for my husband.
All right, all right.
His name is Dale Marks.
He was in 4-B. He was probably wearing his Mets cap.
He usually wears his Mets cap.
I heard there were survivors.
Okay, look, folks, folks, folks, look.
As soon as we have updates for you, we will pass them along.
I know this is a difficult situation, but the finest first responders are out there right now doing everything they can for your loved ones.
Okay, just go with them.
But I...I need...
It breaks your heart, doesn't it?
Worst part is yet to come.
MAN: Flight 207 crew in need of assistance, waiting to deplane.
We have a passenger who is out of control.
Copy. Officer responding.
What, a plane just crashed and some jackass is complaining about not getting his extra bag of nuts?
No, sir, not today.
Yeah.
The water's on fire.
BOBBY: That's jet fuel.
I count 12 to 15 victims on the wing, at least 30 in the water.
How long before that thing sinks?
BOBBY: Based on the timing of the swells, I don't think that plane can take more than four or five sets before going down.
BUCK: Where the hell are we gonna evacuate?
BOBBY: We have to get these people out of here and to the beach.
This thing is going down in four minutes.
WOMAN: Help! Help!
Swim to the raft! Swim to the raft!
The plane is sinking!
Get him up.
Get in the boat. Come on!
Buck, Buck, we got somebody here.
RICHARD: Help, please.
BOBBY: Okay, bring it over here.
I can't get my seat belt off.
It's digging into me.
Stay with me, sir. Stay with me, okay?
I'm gonna pull the thing right off, okay?
We're gonna do this on three, okay?
You're okay, sir. You're okay.
Let's get him up.
We're gonna get you off the plane.
Come on, Buck, come on.
All right.
Get in the raft! Come down!
Mommy, come on, we have to go.
TAMMY: No, my...
That's right, come on, let's go, let's go.
All right.
Pull that chair, Buck. Stop! Stop, Buck!
Her legs are pinned.
TAMMY: Please save him.
All right, take the kid.
No, no!
I'm not leaving without you!
Okay, baby, listen.
Look, look. The firemen are here, okay?
I need you to get on their boat so they can do their job.
Mm-hmm.
If everyone is worried about you and your pretty face, how are they gonna do what they need to do to save me?
Have I ever lied to you?
Then you have to believe me.
I will be with you again so soon.
Mommy loves you so much.
Do this for me.
Okay.
Okay? Okay, baby.
BOBBY: All right, got to go. I'm sorry.
Okay, okay.
Go, baby.
Come on. I got you.
BUCK: It's gonna be okay.
We'll take good care of you.
That's not the last time you're gonna see him, because I'm gonna get you out of here.
Here we go.
Here we go. Careful.
Good boy. I got you.
I got this.
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Buck, Buck. Go check the back of the plane.
We're running low on time.
BILLY: Please.
Get us out of here!
It's filling up with water!
HEN: I'm coming. I'm coming.
HANNAH: Please!
Hang in, hang in.
They're trapped in there.
Hurry, it's filling up fast.
Please hurry! I don't want to drown!
BUCK : Wait, hold the boat!
Tie the rope to the cart.
Give me the other end, come on.
I need this.
Here, take the bag.
Okay, breathe.
TAMMY: Okay.
Oh, oh.
HANNAH: Somebody open it!
Here, take this.
Tie it on the end!
Good to go!
Now, go, go, go!
Everyone, stay clear!
Breathe, breathe.
I got you, I got you.
Come on. There's a step.
HEN: Watch your step. Y'all walk ahead.
Get on the boat.
Come on, Buck, let's go now, now, now!
BOBBY: Take a breath!
Come on, come on.
Just breathe, just breathe.
You're okay, you're okay.
WALLY: Bobby, it's time to go.
Time to go. Get out of there.
You're okay. Come on.
Evacuate all rescue personnel. Everyone off the plane now.
WALLY: That means you too, Cap.
I need a minute.
In a minute, you'll die.
Do you have kids?
Yes.
I died giving birth to my son.
I had a seizure.
And eclampsia, then my heart stopped.
I remember feeling the life leaving my body, but I said no.
And I fought and I fought to come back because a son needs his mother.
You're not gonna die here.
'Cause I'm gonna get you out of here.
I swear on my life. If you go down, I am gonna go down.
Okay? Just keep fighting.
BUCK: Hey, Bobby!
Keep fighting.
I told you to leave, Buck, now!
Yeah!
You know I'm a terrible listener! Here, take this rope!
Tie it to the seat.
It works, trust me.
Ready?
Buck!
Buck! Buck! Buck! Buck!
Oh, Bobby! Bobby!

911, what's your emergency?
All these messages get recorded, right?
Yes, sir.
Good. Look, my name is Dale Marks.
I need to leave a message for my wife, Annie Marks.
I'm on Flight 46, and we're going down.
The plane is going down, sir?
Please, please, look. I don't have a lot of time.
I-I need to say something to my wife.
Okay.
Look, she's having a difficult pregnancy.
So somebody needs to be with her when she...
(passengers screaming in background) Just tell her that I was thinking about her.
And our little girl.
Who I don't think I'm gonna get a chance to see in this lifetime.
I love you, Annie, so much.
So, so much.
And that's not gonna die, even if I do today.
And I promise you, babe, that I'm gonna watch over you both.
I'm so sorry that I cannot come home to you.
I need you to be strong for our daughter.
You tell her that her...
Hello? Dale?
REPORTER: The commercial flight out of Chicago's O'Hare Airport with 176 passengers and six crew members on board went down just before 8:30 this evening, crashing into the Pacific Ocean just north of Dockweiler Beach.
Now, at this hour, search and rescue operations are continuing here with more than a dozen survivors pulled from the water.
It's amazing anyone survived.
DAVE: Pilot knew what he was doing.
Saved a lot of folks on the ground by putting it in the drink.
It's really sad.
* (indistinct police radio chatter) Where's my mom? I want my mom.
(indistinct police radio chatter) Watch her legs.
You're all right.
JAKE: I don't know you.
I want my mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
Thank you.
Captain, Orange County crew arrived.
They're gonna take point on mop up.
There's at least one family that's got a lot to be grateful for.
That's got to make you feel pretty good, right?
Yeah.
* Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse us.
Hey.
Thank you. We owe you everything.
BILLY: You saved our lives.
Oh, it's-it's a team effort, you know?
We're getting married.
He asked me as soon as we made it to dry land.
That's, uh, that's great. Congratulations.
You seem like a very nice couple.
You take care of him, okay? Excuse me.
Abby.
ABBY: Hey.
I'm so sorry. Hi. Um...
It's awful.
Yeah. It's grim.
Yeah. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm-I'm okay.
Okay, well, I just -- I wanted to, um...
I don't know, this may be way out of line, but I am...I'm looking for a survivor.
You knew someone on this flight?
No.
But a call came through a few hours ago from the plane as it was going down.
What? Damn.
I just, I don't know, I want to see if the guy -- I hope, I hope the guy made it.
Yeah, a lot of folks didn't.
I know.
His name is Dale Marks, and he's got a pregnant wife waiting for him, and...
Anyway...
Let me, uh...see what I can find out.
Okay, bye.
(indistinct police radio chatter) WOMAN: Get off of him! This is crazy!
MAN: You're hurting him, man.
This is totally unnecessary.
WOMAN: What is the matter with you people?!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Someone want to tell me what's going on here?
We have it under control.
This is under control?
You got this passenger duct taped to his seat?
We appreciate your concern, Officer, but this man was causing a disturbance; he repeatedly tried to exit the plane when he was told to remain seated.
He assaulted an officer.
I have the whole thing on video.
MAN: No, I will not sit down.
I've been sitting for, like, eight hours.
Sir, I've told you several times.
I need you to take a seat.
And I've told you several times that my father is laying in a casket beneath this plane.
Do you want to talk to my grieving mother?
Do you? Here.
Hang on, Ma. Go ahead.
Explain to my mother why her husband is rotting in cargo.
Okay, I'm not gonna tell you again.
I need you to take a seat.
What, are you gonna kick my ass, huh?
Sir, yes, sir.
WOMAN: Oh, my...oh, my God!
You can't do that!
MAN: Oh! Oh, my God!
You can't do that!
Damn.
That escalated awfully fast.
First of all, you want to take that duct tape off this man's mouth?
Are you insane?
Yes. Thank you.
Now, tell me why these people can't exit this plane.
Yeah, we've been here for eight hours...
All right. All right. Give me a moment.
Give me a moment.
We got word that no one should exit an inbound aircraft.
I see.
You got word. From who?
From the CEO of the airline.
Right now we have no idea what caused that plane to crash.
So until we find out it wasn't terrorism, nobody's getting off this plane.
I-I can hardly believe what I'm hearing.
That badge says Los Angeles Airport Police.
And now you're telling me you're taking orders from CEOs?
A industry whose motto is "The customer is always the moron"?
They make a billion dollars a year on baggage fees, and you're on their side?
Your knees pressing against the seat in front of you because they want to add three extra rows, and you're on their side?
Five damn peanuts in that bag, and you're on their side?
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not today.
Because we both know that it is perfectly safe for these people to get off the plane.
I don't give a damn what the CEO says.
Come on.
No, you didn't just grab my shoulder.
Don't make me...
You place your hand on my shoulder again, we gonna have a big problem.
Now, you said that this customer was causing a disturbance.
Well, then, I'm putting him under arrest for disorderly conduct.
In fact, I'm arresting everyone on this plane.
They in my custody now.
You are all under arrest.
And that means that you are all leaving this plane.
Sorry.
Uh, 52 survivors.
That's pretty good, right? This is my-my first plane crash.
Mine, too. Yeah.
Usually if there is one fatality, it's-it's, like, a four percent survival rate.
I wasn't expecting so many of the bodies to be...
you know, in-in one piece.
Uh, guess it makes identifying the casualties a lot easier -- not that it's easy.
Uh, can I, can I check your list?
Uh, see-see a name, um...Dale Marks?
Oh, no, I think I remember that name.
I think that name's on the other list.
Ah.
All right. Um, thank you.
BUCK: I'm sorry, Abby.
I know it's not what you wanted to hear.
DALE: I love you, Annie, so much.
So, so much.
And that's not gonna die, even if I do today.
And I promise you, babe, that I'm gonna watch over you both.
I'm so sorry that I cannot come home to you.
I need you to be strong.
GIRL: Daddy, what's wrong?
I just had a tough day, honey.
A really tough day.
Because of the plane crash?
A lot of people died.
They did.
Why aren't you crying?
I don't think I have enough tears for all of them.
* A spider is not an emergency, ma'am.
WOMAN: No, I'm telling you.
No.
If you saw the size of this thing...
It-it doesn't matter how big the spider...
I'm gonna call animal control.
Do not call animal control. Ma'am.
Annie's here.
Oh. Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm so sorry.
You sure you want to do this?
Yes.
They're gonna release the tape.
I could get them to expedite it so you could watch it at home.
No. No, I...I need to hear it now.
Okay. Uh, right this way.
WOMAN: What's your emergency?
* You ready?
*
* * I've been asked to take action against you for removing the passengers from that plane.
Great.
So the CEO calls the mayor who calls the captain who calls you?
Yup, that's exactly right, but they can all piss off.
I saw the video. You were totally justified.
These airlines suck. That's not why you're here.
Okay, so, why am I here?
Laila Creedy.
You know who the best police officers are, Athena?
The ones who show integrity and empathy, who use common sense?
Hmm. The ones who don't make my telephone ring.
And right now, I feel as if I operate the Athena Grant crisis hotline.
What were you doing at that party?
It's-it's complicated.
Look, I know about May, and I'm sorry.
I can't even imagine what you're going through right now.
The rage that must be coursing through your veins.
If there's anything I can do, just ask.
I appreciate that.
You're not gonna appreciate this.
I checked the logs.
Nobody called in a noise complaint.
You used your badge to exact a personal vendetta, exposing yourself and this entire department to a lawsuit.
And no matter how justified you or I might find your actions, there's no way the LAPD can condone your behavior.
You were out of line, and too assertive with a minor.
I'm putting you on restricted duty, effective immediately; you're riding the desk.
Captain, wait. Please.
Just-just let me iron out this thing with my daughter.
Then I'll take whatever punishment you want.
You left me no choice.
Bobby?
Bobby, open up!
He ever gone MIA like this before No. Honestly, I don't, I don't know much about his story before he took over the house.
Just that he, uh...he's in recovery.
You hear that?
I'm gonna kick it down.
No. No, you're not.
Bobby and I gave each other spare keys just in case one of us couldn't make it home one day.
Bobby?
* Bobby?
Bob Hey.
Come on, let's get him up.
BUCK: How long has it been?
546 days.
45 and a half if we're being picky.
Days. 18 months.
That crash was hard-core.
Yup.
Thanks.
We all have our breaking point.
BOBBY: Mm-hmm.
Who were you cooking dinner for?
There are four plates set.
I don't know. I was drunk.
I am gonna be fine.
This is a one-time thing, I promise, okay?
I'm good.
I'm sorry I put you guys through this.
You know why redwoods can grow so high?
They move and bend with the wind.
If you stay rigid, eventually you'll break.
You calling me uptight? She's calling me uptight, isn't she?
Maybe ask for help once in a while?
Help.
Oh.
I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Hey, Carla.
Hi.
Wow. Is she down already?
You're good.
She's down, but not out.
I just threw in her favorite DVD.
Yup.
As I call it, "Patricia Clark's lullaby." Me, too.
Yeah, just give it 20 minutes.
She'll be out like a light.
It hasn't failed me once.
God bless Goldie Hawn and that mouth-watering white boy.
Um, are you all gonna be okay tonight?
I can call Howard and stay, you know.
No, I'm fine. I can take care of her.
You go on home.
Okay.
Good night, Carla.
Good night.
You know, if I was as tired as you looked, I might want a little help.
There's no shame in that.
I'm really fine, Carla, thank you.
You go home.
Appreciate it. You're very sweet.
Okay, you know what? I'm staying.
Let's get you in the bed, and I will handle the graveyard shift.
Come on.
Carla, I'm a grown-up person.
I can take care of myself, and I can take care of my mother, okay?
Sorry.
It's been a...a rough couple days, but I'm...
I apologize. But go have a nice night.
Okay? Really, we're fine.
Well, I'll see you in the morning, then.
All right.
Sleep well, Patricia.
PATRICIA: Honey?
Hi, Mom.
You're tired, huh?
Yeah.
You're always a little snappy when you're tired.
You always were that way, even when you were a little a baby.
See, you think I don't remember things.
You're right, Mom.
You're always right.
Oh, it's hot in here.
That girl always leaves the temperature up too high.
Her name is Carla, Mom.
Carla!
Ugh. Whatever.
It's hot. I'm burning up.
Okay, I will turn the thermostat down in just a minute.
Go to sleep, Mom.
Hmm. You, too.
Mom?
Mom. Mom? Mom!
Mom! Mom!

WOMAN: Do you love him?
Ananya.
What, that's a crazy question?
Is he nice?
Uh, I mean, you met him. You didn't think he was nice?
I mean to you. Is he nice to you?
Yeah, he's a good man.
How do you know?
PREM: You can't know.
Not everything, anyway.
I'll learn about her as we go.
But what if you don't like what you learn?
Well, then I'll pray.
For what?
The strength to understand him.
I'd pray for a good divorce lawyer.
Stop.
MAN: She's gonna change you.
Marriage is supposed to change you.
It's a good match.
We all should bless the newly-married couple now.
("Bhootni Ke" by Daler Mehndi playing)
BUCK: 16 DOA so far.
Mostly blunt trauma to the head or crushed by falling debris or other bodies.
One victim impaled.
They fell through two stories.
I won't be surprised if that number goes higher.
HEN: Captain, the groom is devastated -- his bride hasn't been accounted for yet.
We'll find her. Buck, I'm gonna need you to go up top.
Access to the second floor is blocked.
We're gonna have to tackle this thing from both ends.
Okay, Captain.
Savita! Savita!
Savita!
Step back. Step back, it's okay.
If she's in there, we will find her.
Sir, stay back. Sir, let us do our job.
Savita!
Just have a seat, let us do our job.
MAN: Help!
In here!
Hey, I got you.
Ah. Here we go.
My leg...
I think it's broken.
Okay, you hang tight.
BUCK: I got you.
Here we go. We're good, we're good. All right.
Buck. Buck, get over here and give me a hand.
PREM: Savita!
BUCK: She's not moving.
BOBBY: All right, is she breathing?
BUCK: I think so.
Hey, she's coming to. You got it?
BOBBY: Yeah.
Hold on, stay still. Stay still in there.
Here. Here. We got you. Give me your hand.
Okay. Can you move?
All right.
Come on. Slowly, all right?
We got you. We got you.
We got you. Okay, got her.
Easy. Easy. Watch your head.
PREM: Savita.
All right.
Is the owner here?
Uh, that's him right there. Why?
Hey.
When'd you put on the third floor?
When did you put on the third floor?
You think I don't know what that is What...
That's Kal-Pal!
That stuff's been banned.
You didn't reinforce the concrete with steel.
Instead you used that crap.
This used to be a two-story building.
That floor that collapsed -- that was the roof, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?!
HEN: Bobby!
You know what you did, you son of a bitch!
You're going to jail. That's manslaughter!
HEN: Captain, Captain, Captain. !
Captain, Captain, come away. What is wrong with you?
Back off, Hen.
Not 24 hours ago, you were saying, "Help." What happened to that?
So, this wedding -- it's an arranged marriage.
That's a trip, right?
Can you imagine committing to someone you don't even know?
Does anyone really know anybody?
HEN: So how long they gonna have you chained to that desk?
ATHENA: Well, the Creedys are ready to drop their complaint -- you know, so long as the department drops the charges on their daughter.
Not even a little bit.
That girl is wicked.
How's May doing?
She's at home. I mean, it feels like we're back on solid ground.
If we ever were.
I swear, it's like I don't even know these people I'm supposed to be the closest to.
There's a lot of that going around.
Trouble at home?
Mm.
No, no, no. Not at home.
At least, not yet, no.
It's Bobby.
Clark Kent?
After the plane crash...he went on a bender.
Didn't answer his phone for, like, two days.
Buck and I went over there to make sure he was still alive.
And can I tell you, there was not one single picture on the wall. Nothing, no sign of a family.
Nothing. It was just, it was weird.
This guy's been our captain for, like, over a year, and in all that time, he's never really talked about his personal life.
It's like he's got this invisible wall up.
What, you think his wife left him, took everything?
See, it didn't look like somebody had come and cleared out.
It was more like...nobody ever moved in.
Like he's not even really there.
Well, if you want, I'll do a background check.
I got nothing else to do all day anyway.
Nah. Bobby already got trust issues.
I don't want those problems. Nah.
And it's, you know...It's not like I'm saying that he's a bad captain.
Hell...
I think he's the best captain I've ever worked under.
But I'm starting to worry about him.
So...what'd you mean by "not yet"?
Before, when I asked if there was trouble at home, you said "not yet." I got a call this morning from Palmar Women's Correctional Facility.
What does she want?
To see me.
She said it's urgent. I feel like I owe it to her.
You don't owe her anything.
In fact, you got credit in that account.
You're right. But she didn't fight us when we wanted to adopt Denny.
I just don't want her making waves.
And what does your wife have to say about that -- you going to visit your ex at the pokey?
I haven't told her yet.
Look like Bruce Wayne isn't the only one with a few secrets.
MAN: Go, Pack, go!
JOE BUCK: A lot of big plays, week one...
Jamie, this is our roommate, Buck.
He's a fireman.
Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yeah!
Give me some!
Boom!
That's what I'm talking about!
Contact down the field.
Out of time outs!
They're trying to give Laquon Treadwell an opportunity. A lot of contact -- Treadwell's got his hands on him as well.
I got more flyers.
Oh, thanks.
Can you just stick them in here, please?
Hello?
Hey, it's Buck. I got your text.
Oh, hey. Um, yeah, I know, I just...
I sent a blast out to all my contacts.
Are you, are you okay?
Um, no.
I'm not. I'm kind of having a nervous breakdown.
Um...h-how long's she been gone?
I don't know.
Maybe, like, nine hours or something.
She was gone when I woke up.
So I called, you know, I've called the police, I've called the hospitals, the shelters...
My brother's in Vegas. He's gonna try to get a flight back.
Look, I'm-I'm gonna come over.
We'll, uh, we'll find your mom and then we can go back to never seeing each other again, okay?
Thanks.
Hey, baby.
Uh...
Thanks for coming by.
How long has it been, a year?
Sorry, I've -- I just, you know, I haven't been able to get back to see you. I'm sorry.
No, it's cool.
I mean, you got a life and a wife.
How's Diesel?
We, uh, we call him Denny.
None of my business, right?
You, uh, you said something about an emergency?
You don't want to take a minute, check in with your girl?
You're not my girl.
Yeah. Okay.
My parole hearing.
It's coming up soon and my lawyer says I've got a shot.
'Cause I haven't got in a fight in, like, two years, and I've been taking a bunch of accounting courses so...
What do you need from me?
I need someone to vouch for me at my hearing.
You are a respected member of the community, and maybe you could, uh...
maybe you could wear your uniform.
I mean, my lawyer says that I'm close, but someone like you would put me over the top.
I haven't seen you in over a year, Eva.
What would I even say?
You know me.
I mean, you know me better than anyone has ever known me.
And you loved me.
I mean, that time we shared together was the best part of my life.
And I've changed.
I'm...I'm not that troublemaker anymore.
You can see that, can't you?
Oh.
Um...
Abby.
Hi, Buck.
So what do we know so far?
Come in. Come -- yeah, come in. Thanks.
I'm Carla, by the way.
So we're here. I made assumptions based on her being on foot, because if she's on a bus, or in a taxi, then...she could have gotten much further.
No, this is good. This is really impressive.
What do you figure, like, two miles an hour Three.
Patricia's an annoyingly fast walker.
Yeah.
Even if she's been gone for nine hours, she couldn't have been walking the entire time.
I know. That's what I was thinking, so I figure, maybe 15 to 20 mile range, but then that seems too far, so I brought it down to 12.
But in any direction, so we would have just under 527 square miles to check.
But, I mean, literally, she could be anywhere.
I...
I don't know what to do.
I'm so much better when it's somebody else's emergency.
No one is good when it's personal.
But we got this, okay.
We're gonna find your mom. Promise.
Okay. How are we gonna do it?
One mile at a time.
Let's go find her.
Okay.
Come on.
All right.
CARLA: Thanks.
BOBBY: I'm lost.
Figured the only way for a guy like me to pull off leading a crew...
was by shielding them from my own personal damage.
How'd that work out?
It was fine for a while.
Left my baggage at home, made work about getting the job done.
It kept things focused.
But after you log in enough 48-hour shifts, actually living with your coworkers...
Withholding can become a challenge.
They've given me their absolute trust, and I've given them nothing in return.
That can always change, Bobby.
All it takes is a conversation, kind of like this one.
It's not that simple.
There are things about me they just can't know.
Things I can't risk following us out into the field.
You mean that you fell off the wagon?
No.
That I murdered my own family.

* Fire till he is done in * But they catch you at the border *

WEATHERMAN: Forecast, cloudy and windy and cold this morning, warming up a bit this afternoon, with a few sun sprays...
Daddy.
Brookie.
You smell minty.
Did I miss dinner?
Oh, and bath time and homework, but you're just in time for teeth-brushing and bed.
WEATHERMAN: The wind's out of the northwest at 14 miles per hour.
It's currently...
Dad. Dad.
You were falling asleep on the potty.
Oh, I'm just wiped out from work.
We had two fires, brought an old lady to the hospital, a false alarm and I had to wash the truck. Come on.
Do you want to hear what I told Mom in the car today?
BOBBY: What?
The best place to catch on fire is a firehouse.
Uh-huh.
And the best car to get hit by is an ambulance, and the best place to get robbed in is inside a police station.
Where'd you get such a beautiful brain?
Probably Target.
How was your day, bud?
Are you okay?
Has your back been hurting?
I can just always tell when your back is hurting you.
Listen.
Everything is gonna be all right.
I love you. You have sweet dreams.
I love you, too, Dad.
Good night.
Good night, Dad. Love you.
Good night. I love you, too.
BROOK: Sweet dreams.
I'm going for my walk.
Oh, it's-it's freezing out.
Yeah, just, if I don't go for my walk before bed, my back tightens up.
Eh, you know, maybe we should see another doctor.
I mean, why should you still hurt five years after you injured it?
All the doctors say the same thing, that I'm lucky to be walking.
A broken back never really fully heals, so...
All right. I'll...
Wait. Don't-don't go.
Babe, I'm-I'm gonna be right back, all right?
Ah, damn it.
Hey.
When we got married, I accepted the idea that when you went to work, you might not come home.
Baby, I just forgot my phone and then I lost track of time.
I was just walking.
I-I never really thought about what it was I was so scared of losing.
I mean, no woman wants to lose her husband.
You know, the-the love of her life, the father of her children.
You're my rock, Bobby.
Sweetheart, I love you so...
No, no, don't touch me.
Okay, okay.
Don't.
You've been lying to me for months.
But it's so obvious.
Sneaking out and you're losing weight and falling asleep.
You know, but I didn't want to believe it because you were so adamant when you got out of rehab last year that that was, that was the last time.
There would be no relapses. And I thought you would never risk getting caught at work again and losing your job.
So what is it? I mean, I know about the booze, right?
But Is it pills? Is it heroin?
Just everything.
It's anything to make the pain go away.
Look, I took a fall about ten months ago.
I didn't want to tell you about it.
Because you knew I was gonna make you quit.
No. I-I was handling it.
I thought I was.
I had a -- look, I got a prescription.
Look, I thought I was handling it.
I just -- like you said, I'm your rock.
No. No, no, no. Don't you put this on me.
That's not what I mean.
I just, I'm not weak. I can beat this.
This is not who I am. This is not me.
All right? I'm strong. I am unbreakable.
I-I'm Superman. I go into burning buildings and I come out without a scratch.
That's me, not this.
And I don't know when it flipped over into addiction, but I...I got that prescription.
I didn't tell you about it.
And I just needed the OxyContin, and I started to need it more -- 24 hours a day -- and then if I couldn't get it, I went to get something else.
So what? So you would go to work high?
You would -- you'd drive our kids to school high?
I'm sorry.
I will get help. I will go back to rehab.
I'll do anything.
I don't want you here tonight.
You spend the night in your drug den or wherever. Then what?
I love you, Bobby. I don't -- I love you.
I'll forgive you for this, just...not tonight.
Oh.
(sirens wailing, fire truck horn honking) I'm right here. I'm right here. Do you think you can walk?
The alarms didn't go off. The sprinkler!
Try to stay calm. Can you walk?
All right, you stay here. I will come back before the smoke gets too thick.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Just stay right here. I will be back. Stay down.
Please!
Marcy?!
Bobby! Brook!
Marcy! Brook!
We have to evacuate. Come on!
Brook! Bobby!
Now!
Brook! We have to get up there!
My kids are up there!
We'll do what we can, okay? You need to get out of here!
Give me your gear. Give me your...
Get out of here! Let us do what we have to do!
Come on!
Give me your gear! Give me your gear!
Get this guy out of here!
Give me your gear!
Come on!
Give me your gear!
Marcy?!
BOBBY: The super never mentioned who was using the apartment.
Guess he didn't want any trouble.
I don't understand.
How does a...a space heater cause a fire like that?
The building was a death trap.
Nothing to code.
Cheap, flammable facade materials acted as an accelerant.
The sprinklers weren't hooked up.
You never noticed?
No.
Maybe now, sober, I would, but...
I chose to disappear.
Lived on pills and vodka for two years.
148 people died in that fire, including...
I killed them.
My own kids, my own family.
I murdered them in their sleep.
Choked 'em on smoke and I burned their little bodies.
Such a burden.
Such a burden, and you've been carrying this all by yourself all this time.
It's not the kind of story I want to share.
With your friends?
And your coworkers?
I'm their leader.
They have to trust me enough to follow me into situations where their lives are at risk.
There is no room...for them to doubt me.
You made a mistake, Bobby.
Every church is built on the possibility of human redemption.
God forgives more easily than people do.
You know, if you don't trust your friends to see and know you for who you are -- honestly, completely -- then you don't really have any friends.
Give them a chance.
You're allowed to be human.
I just miss 'em so much.
So you about ready to tell me what's bugging you?
You're not gonna like it.
Something's bothering you. I don't expect to like it.
What is it?
Eva called. She's up for parole.
Great.
She asked me to speak on her behalf at the hearing.
Good.
You can tell the parole board that she's nothing but trouble, and needs to stay locked up and out of our lives.
Out of Denny's life.
HEN: Baby, I hear you, I do, but I really think she's made an effort this time.
She's done a lot of career education.
She's taken some accounting courses.
She's trying.
Have you been to see her?
Can't believe this.
She's not even out yet, and she's already got you sneaking around.
Karen, that's not fair.
Did she even ask about Denny?
Hmm?
Sort of, in passing.
She doesn't give a crap about him.
Good, good.
That's a good thing.
Because if she gets out, we don't want her involved in Denny's life.
That's why I went to go see her.
I don't want her -- we, we don't want to give her a reason to be vindictive.
She's really...she's not as bad as you think.
Baby...she's worse.
'Cause she will always be your first great love.
Oh, come on.
ATHENA: Yeah, I see your BOLO right here -- Patricia Clark, 75-year-old white female.
They got me riding a desk right now, but I'll keep my ears open.
Thank you, Sergeant.
She won't let us down.
And we have this.
So if a call comes in about your mom, we can be first on the scene.
Kind of a bummer we had to meet under these circumstances.
I mean, especially with our "only on the phone" plan.
Worst first date ever, right?
I've probably had worse.
Well, I mean, to be honest, it's a little fuzzy.
It's been a while since I've been out on a date.
How long, a few weeks?
Try more like almost a year.
What? I mean, that's not possible.
Who do you have sex with?
You've not had sex in almost a year?
No, I haven't had sex in-in-in a year...
...probably.
Not even with yourself?
Oh, my God.
I didn't say that.
Although, I am more a, you know, human contact, you know, touch of skin kind of person.
It's just really hard to feel sexy with your mom dying in the dining room.
MALE DISPATCHER: Respond to 800 Comstock Ave.
TA into power pole.
High-voltage wires down in swimming pool.
Three-year-old child trapped.
That's, like, two blocks from here.
Truck's been dispatched. They got it.
Yeah, but it'll take 'em eight to 12 minutes to get there.
I mean, this I know, 'cause I do it every day.
We should go.
Can't just pass it by.
Come on.
You guys okay? You okay?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.
WOMAN: Help! Help!
Just came out of nowhere.
WOMAN: I need help!
All right, we should go.
We should go. Go.
WOMAN: Help!
WOMAN: Help!
WOMAN: Help! Someone help!
Can you please help me? Please help.

Stay back. Stay...What are you doing?

No. Hey, hey, I'm a firefighter, okay?
You can't see it, but those power lines are sending 5,000 volts through that water.
Anyone touches it and they are dead.
Okay, listen, listen, I understand. It's okay.
I'm gonna help.
Okay.
LYLA: Mama!
You and your wife do everything you can to make sure she stays on that float, okay?
Baby, listen, Mommy and Daddy are right here.
We're gonna come get you. Right now, okay, you have to stay...
Can we turn the power off ourselves?
No. Um...
Okay, stay there.
Sweetie, it's okay.
ABBY: What are you doing?
I'm, uh, I'm gonna ride this thing out and scoop her up.
No, you're not! Did you get that from the macho handbook?
That's insane.
Yeah, there's no way that book actually exists.
Actually, give me your knife.
You have a knife, right? You're a fireman.
Give me your knife.
Yeah, okay, okay.
Quick, quick, quick.
MAN: Okay.
ABBY: I think...
Here. Take this.
Okay, it's rubber, so it won't conduct electricity.
Okay, great. That's good. That's genius.
Okay.
Pull it across. Be careful.
Just go slow.
Okay, baby? Baby.
Do you see this?
Can you grab this for Mommy? Can you grab that?
Oh, you're such a good girl. Don't let go, okay?
Good job.
Oh, my God!
It's okay.
ABBY: It's okay, it's okay.
We're good. We're good.
Hold on. Hold on, sweetie.
Hold on tight.
There you go.
Oh, my God.
Hold tight.
Be careful, Buck.
Here we go.
WOMAN: You're doing such a good job.
Hold on.
Okay, keep holding. All the way over.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Don't go in the water.
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
MAN: Oh, my God.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, please.
Baby.
Oh.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah.
DWP cut the power.
Thank you so much.
We're all clear.
Oh, my...
Great. Thank you.
Thanks, guys. How you doing?
Good job.
Good to see you. Thank you, man.
Good to see you guys. Yeah.
You, too.
You were so brave.
Okay.
Better. Better.
WOMAN: Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Good job.
Thanks.
What?
Nothing.
ABBY: That was so exhilarating.
I mean, I'm usually miles away on the other end of a phone.
You get to do that every day.
Such a high.
Well, you were really good.
Thanks.
I know.
Let's go find her.
Yeah.
So, um, you asked what I was looking at before, right?
When we, when we high It was your hands.
See, in an emergency situation, the body produces adrenaline.
Uh, keeps your mind focused, dulls any pain, makes you super strong.
It's a normal human response.
My first few calls, I was shaking like crazy for an hour after.
Your hands, they never shook.
I mean, you were like a full-on Jedi.
Well, I do have some experience with stress.
Sure.
But also, I feel calm around you.
Uh, hey. Sergeant.
Uh, did -- did you find her?
ATHENA: A woman fitting her description was brought into County General about 20 minutes ago.
Hey, Abby. Athena.
Hey, is she, uh...is she okay?
Doctor's looking at her now.
Yeah.
I'm Abby Clark.
You guys have actually met.
Abby was the 911 dispatcher on that home invasion in Winnetka.
Oh, no fooling. Okay.
Well, um, I'm still trying to get the story on what happened to her, but, um, seems like your mother made it all the way to South Los Angeles.
These fellas brought her in.
Um, thank you guys so much.
Was she hurt?
Nah.
She was confused and agitated.
She didn't belong there. You could tell.
So we brought her here.
I've seen it before with my abuelita.
And I'm sorry to say, but it doesn't get no better.
Thank you so much.
No problem. No problem whatsoever.
PATRICIA: Abby.
Mom.
Abby.
Mom.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
It's okay, Mom.
Oh. Oh.
ABBY: It's okay.
Okay, Mom. Okay.
Okay.
Is this Tommy?
Did you cut your hair differently?
Mom, that's not Tommy.
Um, I broke up with Tommy. That's Buck.
He was the one who helped me find you.
Where did I go?
I'm just gonna walk him out, okay?
And I'll be right back. Okay.
I'm just...I'm...
Okay.
It was, uh, it was nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
Thank you. Um...
Be kind to her.
ABBY: Okay. Um...
All right. Listen, now, be safe, okay?
Okay. Bye.
Take care.
Be right back.
So, that is the most amount of time I have ever spent with a woman I want to have sex with without actually having sex with her.
My mom?
It's that nightdress.
It's just so hot.
Well, I guess we should probably just...go back to being phone buddies again.
Why?
Because I like hanging out with you, too, and I think that if we continue to hang out, we will...
Mistakes will be made.
But I do want to say thank you so much for today, and not just for what you did for my mom and for me, which was amazing.
But you really gave me back a piece of myself.
You're the first person in a long time to show me that I exist outside of this house and away from this hospital bed and the frustration.
So thanks.
Well, then, you're very welcome.
Really.
And no matter what you're feeling right now...
...don't go have sex with some girl on Tinder.
You were thinking about it.
Mmm.
I'll call you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
Good night.
Good night.
It is a beautiful day, Henrietta.
My love.
Call me Henrietta again, you're going over the balcony.
Okay, then. Bobby.
Oh, captain, my handsome captain.
What are you, high?
No, I'm not high.
I met a woman.
Two, actually.
I met a woman and her mother.
And I didn't have sex with either of them.
Ooh, why's it so cold in here?
911, what's your emergency?
Yeah, I'm down at the car wash on 3rd. My boy got stuck in the brush.
I'm confused, sir. Your --
Just get someone down here, please! He's hanging there like a puppet!
I have told him a million times, wait for everything to be shut off before you hose down the place.
But does he listen? No.
He doesn't listen. You know what happens?
This. This is what happens.
Sir, can you hear me?
Um, yeah.
Does anything feel broken?
Uh, you want to maybe wait until I decide he's okay to be moved?
Be glad when Chimney gets back.
We'll all be glad for that.
Run it again!
Hey.
This is a good one. You got to see this.
All right, play the tape. Come on, one more time.
Wait for it. Wait for it.
Oh, crap.
No, no, no, no, no!
Buck, that man could have been seriously injured.
Help! Help! Help!
HEN: Listen, this is so...unprofessional.
HEN: I'm not laughing.
I'm not.
Yes!
Oh, okay.
I'm not laughing.
HEN: Oh, man.
I have never seen you laugh like that.
Well, I wasn't always like this.
So shut down.
What happened, Captain?
I made some mistakes, and I...lost everything I cared about.
And I moved forward by never letting anybody get so important to me that I had to go through that kind of loss again.
But apparently I'm not very good at it, because you, Buck and Chimney have become that important to me.
Just let us in, Bobby.
I'll tell you what.
Let's get back to the house.
I'll cook you a delicious meal, and I'll introduce you to someone.
Who?
Me.
* Hey.
BUCK: Hey.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, of course.
Did you want to have sex with me?
What?
Like, you might have made a mistake, too, right?
Um, yeah.
I mean...yeah, definitely.
And, you know, you're...muscly and...kind and...you're fun. Yeah.
And you said we can...
Yeah.
Are you in bed? I'm in bed.
Yeah, I'm in bed.
What are you wearing?
* Open skin * I wait on you
I don't think this is exactly the spirit of what I meant.
Do you want me to stop?
No.
* The bottom of the deep blue.
 @@@@@@
* Fly me to the moon * Let me play * Among the stars * Let me see what...
MAN: Hey, look.
WOMAN: Oh, wow.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
MAN: I told you you'd love it.
WOMAN : I had to work up the courage.
You've had your pilot's license for all of a month.
Had no faith.
* Baby, kiss me...
MAN: Now, look.
Wow.
It's amazing.
Now, look, Kate, Griffith Park Observatory.
KATE: Our first date.
MAN: Best day of my life.
I'm gonna swing us back around, okay?
Okay.
* All I worship and adore...
Crap.
Aah, aah!
This is not good.
KATE: What's not What's happening?
MAN: Uh, th-there's a binder under your seat.
Grab it. Last page is a checklist.
Um, uh, okay.
Uh...
Now, last one.
Okay. Okay, here.
"Emergency landing without engine power"?
Read the list, babe.
Um, "Airspeed 65 knots." Check.
KATE: "Mixture idle cutoff." MAN: Check.
"Verify flight ring is engaged." Check.
KATE: "Initiate engagement process." Check.
"Confirm pilot is head over heels in love with the passenger."
MAN: Check.
KATE: "Will the pilot promise "to love and cherish the passenger until his dying day?"
MAN: Double check.
I love you so much, Kate.
I hate you.
MAN: What do you say? Do you like it?
Will you be my copilot?
Kate.
Hey, Kate. Kate?
Aah!
Kate! Kate! Kate!
911, what's your emergency?
My girlfriend passed out! I think she had a heart attack.
Is she breathing normally, sir? Can you feel a pulse?
Yeah, yeah I can feel her breathing. But her heart is racing like crazy.
What is your location, sir? An ambulance will be on the way.
No, it won't! I'm in a Cessna flying over Los Angeles.
Oh, okay.
Tell me what happened up there, sir.
Was she complaining of chest pain or nausea?
No, no, nothing. She just passed out.
Is she on any medications?
Uh, yeah, uh, some kind of thyroid medication, but nothing serious.
I can't believe I did this. I think I did this.
Did what, sir?
I-I pretended there was something wrong with the plane.
Why would you do that?
I had a proposal written out on the emergency instructions.
I was gonna propose on Valentine's Day Okay.
Um...and I don't want to be so on the nose, so I thought I'd do it a few days early.
Okay, okay, listen to me.
You have to get her on the ground.
Have you notified Air Traffic Control?
Yeah, yeah, they said I could touch down at Burbank Airport in 15 minutes.
Is there any place closer where you could make an emergency landing?
Get off. Get off.
Brakes, brakes, brakes.
All right, let's put her over here.
Okay.
Does she have any history of heart problems?
MAN: No, she's only 32.
How does this happen?
Blood pressure's 80/40.
Still dropping.
Hen, looks like a possible heart attack.
Nitro sublingual.
Hey, Abbs, I'm-I'm on a call.
ABBY: Okay, but don't hang up.
I'm the one who took the call you're on.
Listen, after he told me about the stunt that he pulled and he told me about her condition, I called her doctor.
Wait, wh --
ABBY: Oh, he didn't tell you?
Romeo faked an air emergency.
You faked an emergency?
I was proposing.
I thought I was being romantic.
ABBY: The doctor says she's on levothyroxine for her thyroid condition, which you know can 'cause heart palpitations.
Guys, she's on levothyroxine.
Not a heart attack.
Broken heart syndrome?
That's what I'm thinking.
Okay.
I'll get the adenosine.
Mimics the symptoms of a heart attack.
It was probably brought on by her thyroid medication and you nearly scaring her half to death.
HEN: You don't treat it the same as a cardiac event.
That nitro we almost gave her could've caused some real damage.
All right, she's coming to. She's coming to.
That's it. Take some deep breaths.
Good call, Abby. She's, uh, she's conscious.
She's conscious, she's conscious.
You're okay.
BOBBY: You're okay.
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Oh, baby, thank God.
BOBBY: All right, you think you can sit up?
Here, take it slowly.
KATE : Can I see the ring again?
Wait, what's happening?
I think she's actually considering his proposal.
Yes.
She said yes.
And she smacked him.
Love hurts.
Good. All right.
Now, three tablespoons of sugar.
The tablespoons are the bigger ones, Mom.
I know.
Let her remember.
Remember? Mom.
Honestly? I think this is the first time I've ever seen you bake anything.
Oh.
I mean, Dad always did the cooking.
Well, I made plenty of reservations.
And now you're making Valentine's cookies.
I love Valentine's Day.
It's, like, the one day of the year we can be sappy and romantic and in love with love.
So, then, why are you dating a guy who only likes to bone on the phone?
We're not dating, Carla.
Although he did invite me to the party at the firehouse.
I don't know. It's getting kind of irritating.
I mean, I'm fine with him being a boy toy.
You know, I'm all right with that.
But he's so afraid he's gonna do something wrong or hurt me or something.
Frankly, I just want to put on some fancy underwear, and...
...get my hair done, and go out, and have a nice time and feel special.
Amen to that.
Well, maybe if Buck doesn't pull through, we'll all do a girls' night.
Ooh.
CARLA: No. No way.
A woman like you, smart and sexy with hair like an angel deserves a real Valentine's Day.
If he doesn't want to give it to you, honey, then...sayonara, fireboy.
Oh, yes.
Okay.
God, I hate Valentine's Day.
Everywhere you look, it's perfume ads, candy ads, jewelry ads. It is a fake holiday designed by women to make guys feel guilty and go into debt.
You think it's just women who run the companies that are trying to sell you those things?
BUCK: Well, they're at least in on it.
Well, I know plenty of women...
who don't like Valentine's Day and plenty of guys who love it.
You?
Yeah.
Here and there, I've been known since I was about eight years old to like Valentine's Day.
And after I met my wife, I'll tell you what...
you have someone to share it with, it could be pretty great.
You must miss her a lot on Valentine's Day.
Miss her every day, Buck.
Miss her every day.
* Here comes Johnny Yen again * With the liquor and drugs...
Welcome back, Chim.
Aw, you guys.
BUCK: How does it feel to be back?
Uh, beats the alternative.
Seriously, though, everybody, uh, one thing I realized while I was gone is that, uh, I really need you people like I need a hole in the head!
Oh! I cannot.
Place hasn't been the same without you, Chim.
You're the heart of this firehouse.
I'm glad to have you back.
Thanks, Bobby.
ATHENA: Hey, you had a lot of people praying for you, not just this department, either.
Well, I think somebody was listening.
Even the doctors kept using the word "miracle." I guess if you're gonna have a piece of rebar that's sticking through your skull, that's the way to do it.
Just you, Buck.
Oh. Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade.
Oh, that's not funny.
Shade, shade.
BOBBY: All right. Let's light you up so you can make a wish.
All right.
All right, who's got a match?
Really?
Firehouse and nobody's got a match?
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Yeah, uh, I'm here for the party.
Oh, you're a friend of Chimney's. Come on.
No, I'm not a friend. I mean, I feel like I know Chimney, but...'cause I feel like I...
You're...are you Captain Nash?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Abby Clark, a friend of Buck's.
Oh, you're the woman from the phone.
Yes...
911 operator.
Right. Yes, yes, yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
BUCK: Hey, Abby.
Hi.
You showed. That's so cool.
Hi.
How are you doing? It's good to see you.
Hi.
Hey.
BUCK: And you brought cookies.
ABBY: I brought cookies.
Come on up.
Uh, so, everyone, um, this is Abby Clark.
She is L. A.'s fiercest 911 operator and she brought cookies, so...
Ah, there you go.
Come on in.
This is, uh, this is Chimney.
The-the guy...
CHIMNEY: Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is Ab-Abby.
Oh, I'm good.
I can barely feel it now.
ABBY: Oh, great.
Uh, would you like some cake?
No, I'm good. Thank you.
Okay.
Uh, okay, come on, come on. There's...
It's nice to meet you.
You, too.
I was gonna light the candle.
I get dumped after surviving rebar through my skull and he ends up with her?
What's that kid have that I don't?
Forget I asked.
Yes.
All right.
I want a lot of ice cream.
ABBY: Oh, God.
Yeah, it's...
that's one thing to say about it.
It's cool.
Hey.
Yeah.
Nice to see you.
You, too.
Oh, you know what, she's doing fine. Thank you.
Thanks for asking.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Hen.
Hi, Hen, I'm Abby.
I work with your boy here.
Glad to know you really exist.
Mm.
ABBY: Thanks.
He talks about you all the time.
Really?
Little. Little bit.
So, where's he taking you?
Valentine's Day tomorrow.
Oh, we, uh...
We hadn't really, uh...
Don't. We don't have a plan.
Yeah, I mean, you know, I-I have to work, and...
Your shift ends at 2:00. So does mine.
I'm going home to my wife.
Uh, well, we're just being casual.
It's no big deal.
It's just...It's just a day.
Yeah, the only day he's obligated to show you a good time.
So, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?
Me?
Hell, I put in for a extra shift.
I'm doing whatever I can to get my mind off romance for the night.
Oh.
So, where you taking her?
And it better not be a salad bar.
Whoa.
No, you know, it'll be someplace, uh, really nice.
Okay.
Great. Yeah.
Cool.
Getting kinda late for a rezzy.
Well, I know people.
HEN: Oh.
He knows people.
He knows people.
Oh, yeah.
Good-bye, Hen. Good-bye, Hen.
Ah...
Um, we gotta go.
Um, tomorrow. How about 7:00?
Okay. All right.
All right, see ya.
Thanks. Go.
Did you not like it?
It's good, it's just a little salty for my taste.
Oh. Well, I have a lot of snacks for our Valentine's Day double feature: The Notebook and Fatal Attraction.
I'm kidding. I hate The Notebook.
Uh, we can have sex during intermission.
You told me you didn't want to make a V-Day plan, so that means we get to do mine instead.
Now is the moment in my schedule where you give me my gift.
Oh, right.
You mentioned, once, liking that brand, so...
I like chocolate.
I like Le Vian diamonds.
Real diamonds, not Le Vian diamond-shaped chocolates.
Did you think I was going to get you real diamonds?
Ted, I had a plan.
A really specific plan for tonight, and you're messing it up.
You gave me a $14.00 box of chocolates for Valentine's Day.
I spent all day cooking for you and getting waxed and buying sexy underwear -- I spent hours on tonight.
Maybe you should have spent a few less hours salting the food.
Okay, that's it, I'm out.
You know, my friends told me to stay away from you.
Said you had the crazy eyes.
You told me you loved me.
I tell that to everyone.
Okay, you want me to do this the hard way? Fine.
You're not my only girlfriend.
Okay? I-I can't watch a movie with you because I've got plans with another girl later tonight.
Got her the same box of chocolates.
You don't mean anything to me, Melora.
Okay, get out of the way, Melora.
911, what's your emergency?
Yeah, something's happening at my neighbor's place.
I'd knock, but I don't want to get involved. Can you send someone?
ATHENA: LAPD. Open up, please.
You all right, ma'am?
Yes, I'm fine.
We got a noise complaint from one of your neighbors.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I got into a fight with my boyfriend.
It probably got loud.
Is he still here?
No, I'm all alone.
Mind if I come in?
I'll just have a look around?
Sure.
MELORA: Dumped on Valentine's Day.
Can you believe it?
Yeah, well, men can be dogs.
I just thought he was a good dog.
Thought he would be the one.
Yeah, well, sometimes the one isn't even the one.
Take it from me, you can be married and still feel alone.
Sometimes, yeah.
We all do.
But you're wearing that ring.
Yeah, well, I took a vow.
That's so beautiful.
Listen.
Any man who can do this to you on Valentine's Day, he ain't worth it.
All right? You're better off without him -- you hear me?
That's from a long time ago.
That was really just a cry for help.
I'll tell you what.
You've been through a lot tonight.
If the blues come back and you feel like crying out for help, you make a call and talk to me.
This is my card.
I'll be on duty all night.
You've got a good heart.
DISPATCHER: Available units.
Available units, 211 in progress, corner of Beverly and Vermont.
727-L-30. Show me en route.
You okay?
I will be now. Thank you.
I just got some excellent advice from a very wise woman.
You sure you don't want me to stay?
I feel bad, you and Chimney having to pull double shifts.
Aw, Chimney's so excited to be back, he'd work four shifts in a row if we asked him to.
I already told Gardner I'd cover the first half of his day so he could spend it with his wife.
So I'm good. All right, turn around.
What if I screw this up?
Screw it up?
Well, my advice is don't.
Uh, okay, what happens if we start having sex?
Why would that happen?
'Cause that's what always happens -- I'm a sex addict.
Self-diagnosed, yeah.
Listen, it's not uncommon for a guy to use quick, meaningless sex to avoid real intimacy.
So you're saying, you know, it might be okay to sleep with her, just as long as I'm not a dick about it?
I didn't say that.
Is that what you think I said?
That's what I heard.
That's not what I said.
Why don't you try this?
Why don't you try something new?
Why don't you try, just once, getting to know her? Really get to know her.
Okay...
CARLA: Wow.
It just jumped ten degrees in here.
You don't look like a whore at all.
Thanks, Mom.
Well...I'm excited.
And with any luck, nobody'll get hurt.
Okay, look, I need you to stop worrying about everybody else's wants and feelings, and start worrying about your own, okay?
Fine. I'm just...I'm excited.
It's Valentine's Day and I'm going out.
Okay, so I should...not sleep with her tonight.
Correct.
Okay.
You should not have sex with her tonight if you're really interested in her.
A woman like that deserves a little chivalry.
Chivalry? Okay, I like that.
You know, and...don't be a dick.
You know what, Buck, I think if you focus on the first part, the second part'll take care of itself.
Geez.
I got it, I got it. Let me try on this jacket.
You look real handsome.
Yeah.
Okay. Good.
Good luck.
I don't want it.
Good luck keeping it in your pants.
No, I'm not...Bobby!
911, what's your emergency?
There's this, like, totally insane crash on the 710! I'm 100% fine, but there's like a million cars piled up everywhere.
Ugh! I'm totally gonna be late to the V-Day dance.
I need you to back up, sir.
So, what's the situation here?
12 cars, no fatalities.
But we got a medical transport vehicle sandwiched in there.
Driver's freaking out. Says they were delivering an organ for transplant.
Please, this organ has to get to Southland Medical immediately.
The patient is critical. She's prepped and waiting.
I got this.
Buckle up, buttercup.
MED TECH: Uh, what...
what...okay. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa!
Oh, g...
ATHENA: Hang on.
* There goes my heart...
MED TECH: I don't think we're gonna make it.
ATHENA: Oh, we're gonna make it.

MED TECH: Her name is Anna Cerritos.
She's a 16-year-old high school student from Seattle.
Her whole family's flown out here to be with her.
All right, we got you, Anna.
* It couldn't last somehow
MED TECH: Whoa, big truck.
White truck. Truck truck!
* I never thought...
No, any...! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look out!
* There goes my heart...
ATHENA: Here we are.
Thank God.
* And here * Am I.
Thank you, Officer. You may have saved a life tonight.
ATHENA: Well, I can't think of anything better than delivering a heart on Valentine's Day.
That was a kidney.
Kidneys are good.
727-L-30, this is Dispatch. Come in.
Go for 727-L-30.
DISPATCHER: Sergeant Grant, police welfare check requested at 844 Sanborn, Los Angeles.
Show 727-L-30 responding.
Sergeant Athena, you came.
Uh...I was under the impression that, uh, you were having distress?
I was having a moment.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Did you know See's Candies is open 24/7?
I just...I wanted to thank you for your kind words earlier.
Oh...
I ate all the caramel ones.
Uh, wh -- wait, you know, this is, this is very sweet of you, but, um...
You really didn't have to do this.
I just...You were so kind to me, and I was thinking, we're both members of The Lonely Hearts Club.
Um...
To The Lonely Hearts Club!
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, here, let me just, um...
No. Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.
I-I appreciate the thought.
Um, may I use your restroom and then go?
Of course. You're working. I'm sorry.
It's just down the hall to the left.
MELORA: There's hydrogen peroxide under the sink if you need it.
Thank you. I'm fine.
If that doesn't work, there's ammonia under there, too.
That works really well on blood.
Melora.
I'm gonna need to get, uh, your ex-boyfriend's phone number for my report.
Melora?
Wish you hadn't gone in there.
The superglue's still drying. It isn't ready yet.
Think this'll work?
I'd actually recommend this one, sir.
Okay.
Full-bodied red. Pair nicely with both of your meals.
Fantastic. That's what we'll go with.
ABBY: He's so cute.
Thank you.
Oh, God, I wonder if he'll ask to see his ID.
What if he asks to see his and not mine?
Ahh.
Hey.
You weren't kidding. You really do know people.
I don't know how you got us in here.
I, uh, I know the owner. Well, I-I met him, um...
We, uh...we contained a noxious gas leak for them a couple weeks ago, so...
Oh...
Yeah, just try not to breathe much.
Yeah, do that.
Uh...
Um, uh, no.
It's fine. Uh, he was really appreciative.
Thank you very much.
Uh, yeah, sure. Tastes like wine to me.
Thank you.
Oh, no thanks.
Oh, please. Go ahead.
BUCK: Man, she's pretty.
Her hair's amazing.
Look like that before?
Buck, stop.
Remember, you're not sleeping with her.
ABBY: I think I can see his muscles through that jacket.
Cheers. Thank you.
And happy Valentine's Day.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Mm.
Be cool. I'm not choking in front of her.
Yeah.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Wait, don't drink, 'cause you could...
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, God. Wait, don't drink.
Do you know the Heimlich maneuver?
I do. Get him up.
Okay.
Get him up.
He's not breathing.
911, what's your emergency?
I'm at Le Chance Bistro in Century City. I need paramedics dispatched. Adult male, 26, fully blocked airway.
He stopped breathing about 30 seconds ago. I've started compressions.
Come on, Buck.
Call 911.
We already did.
Call 'em again. Put 'em on speaker.
OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency?
It's emergency dispatcher Abby Clark, Parker Center.
I'm not on site.
I need to speak to Stephanie Gaskins in Emergency Medical Dispatch.
STEPHANIE: This is EMD Gaskins.
Steph, it's Abby.
ABBY: I've got an adult male, fully obstructed air pipe.
Yes, but he's unconscious.
I can't remove the object.
He stopped breathing two minutes ago.
Another three minutes, and he's gonna have brain damage.
I need you to walk me through an emergency tracheotomy.
Abby, have you lost your mind?
Come on.
You know the paramedics are gonna be at least seven minutes.
I can't let this happen.
I've got to do something.
You got a knife? Something sharp?
And you're going to need something to keep the airway open, like a pen or a straw.
A knife a-and a pen or a straw, something.
Okay.
WAITER: Here.
Thanks.
Find the indentation between his Adam's apple and the cricoid cartilage.
Okay.
Yup. Okay, I think I found it.
STEPHANIE: You're going to make a horizontal incision, a half-inch wide and about half-inch deep.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Okay.
STEPHANIE: There shouldn't be a lot of blood, but try to keep it from leaking into his windpipe.
Okay, I did it.
STEPHANIE: Okay, stick your finger in, open it up.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay.
Get the pen in there.
Two quick breaths.
Five seconds. Four...
Three...Two. Another quick breath.
PARAMEDIC: Excuse me, excuse me. Gurney coming through.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
PARAMEDIC: Gurney coming through.
You're okay.
911, what's your emergency?
I, uh. I can't move. I think I broke my back.
Sir, you are going to have to speak up. Did you say you think you broke your back?
Yes. Yes, I fell.
Can you speak up please? It sounds like you're whispering.
Just please come to 617 Marshall Drive in Van Nuys.
CHIMNEY: Was the caller the only one in the house?
BOBBY: As far as I know, but if not, he could be laid up.
You might have to bust the door open.
Check in there, too.
LAFD, anybody home?
Los Angeles Fire Department, anybody home?
All right, Chim, go ahead.
All right.
Bust it open.
CHRISTINA: Um...
Hi. Can I help you?
Uh, yes, a man called 911, gave us this address.
Said he had fallen, he was in some kind of distress.
Male in distress?
No. I'm the only man here, and pretty sure I'm not in distress.
And the two of you have been home all night?
I-I was. Alex...
I told her I had to work on Valentine's Day.
You should have seen how pissed off she was at me.
But it was all part of the plan.
He came home and surprised me with flowers and takeout from Mr. Chows.
Yeah, her favorite.
I'm a serious romantic.
So you weren't expecting him home until later?
Not for hours.
Uh, would you guys mind if we took a quick peek around the perimeter?
It's procedure.
Yeah, yeah. Of course. You want me to show you around?
No. We've got it. You can get back to your romance.
Yes.
Got it?
Watch your step, there, Captain.
Watch your step.
See anything, Chim?
Nothing over here.
Hey, Chim.
Over here.
Oh. Shh.
Come here.
Don't move. Do not move, sir.
You jumped from up there, didn't you?
Yeah. Yes.
Okay.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Uh, two.
Uh, Valentine's Day.
They broken?
Ow.
Ah...
There's deformity. They're both broken.
BOBBY: Sir, I'm just gonna stabilize your neck.
There.
Ah.
So you sustained what we call a Casanova Fracture.
What, uh, w-why is it called a Casanova Fracture?
Well, woman is having an affair, husband comes home early, the guy jumps off: Casanova.
Oh, God.
Y-ow, ow, ow!
Sir, take it easy, we're gonna roll you over.
Careful. No.
On the count of three.
No. No!
One, two, three.
No. No.
Oh, God! Oh...
CHIMNEY: You're okay. You're all right.
You're okay. Yeah, okay.
MICKEY: Oh, God, my leg. Ow!
What the...oh, God.
What the hell is going...?
Was he in here when I got home?
You said you were gonna be at work.
Oh.
BOBBY: All right, take a breath. This man has been severely injured, and you can work this all out with your wife once we get him medical attention and get him out of here.
She's not my wife.
She's my wife.
We're separated.
You said it was done between the two of you.
You asked me to move in here.
I'm sorry. I-I really am.
There's just so much history between us.
So many memories.
Oh, God!
CHRISTINA: Baby.
MICKEY: What?
I am so sorry.
Are you okay?
Uh, I'm okay.
I'm okay. I love you.
I love...I love you.
I love you!
CHRISTINA: Wait.
Wait, can I ride with him?
BOBBY: Yeah, so long as the divorce papers aren't signed yet.
So was that creepy or romantic?
Eh, a little of both.
Got to love Valentine's Day.
This...
This was supposed to be a surprise.
Ted didn't seem to appreciate the effort I put into Valentine's Day, but...
he will once I'm done with him.
Once you're done with him?
Melora, you chopped him up and superglued him back together.
Well, yeah. How would you have done it?
Melora, stop it. Look at me.
Look at me.
You're sick.
And it's not your fault.
You're on so many drugs, you don't know what you're doing.
No, that's not true.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
And actually, you know what?
I'm so sick of people telling me what's wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong with my brain.
It's my heart. I have a broken heart.
Melora, you're suffering, and you've been hurt.
And I can relate.
You have to believe me when I tell you that heartbreak doesn't last forever.
But some mistakes do.
Now whatever happens after tonight, the system can-can go easy on a woman scorned, but not on one who hurts a cop.
So untie me. I can help you, but you have to untie me.
WOMAN: Somebody help me, please!
Help me!
Well, look who finally woke up.
Who else is here, Melora?
Ashleigh.
The girl Ted was gonna spend Valentine's Day with.
He met her at the gym because could he be more of a cliché?
I saw it in their texts.
And then I texted her from his phone and told her to come here for a romantic rendezvous...
I bashed her over the head when she came, with a pan, a couple times, but not enough, apparently, 'cause she hasn't lost the ability to speak.
She's not a good person. She's not like us.
ASHLEIGH: Please help me!
Or maybe she's a victim, too.
Maybe Ted duped her, just like he did you.
No.
Maybe he didn't tell her that he already had a girlfriend.
No, she knew.
They probably had a good laugh about me!
Help, please!
Well, maybe you should bring her up here so we can find out.
We could talk to her together.
You think I should kill her up here?
No, you shouldn't hurt that girl.
She has to die tonight, because what if she tries to get Ted back?
Sweetheart, Ted's dead.
He won't be once I fix him, okay?
Ted was perfect. He had a job, he was handsome, the sex was great.
Only problem was that he had an awful, cheating heart.
He just needs a new heart, a good one.
ASHLEIGH: Help!
It doesn't work that way.
Course it does.
You're a really good person, Athena.
You honored your vows.
You were so nice to me.
That's why I had you come back here tonight because your heart is so wonderful and pure.
And if I can take your heart and put it in Ted, then all of my dreams come true.
MELORA: This says I need a handsaw to get through your rib cage. I mean, who the heck has a handsaw just lying around?
Whatever, I'll make it work.
That's what Melora does.
Makes the best out of things.
Creating art from garbage.
Get your hands off of me.
How am I supposed to cut your heart out if I can't touch you?
Do you know the real history of Valentine's Day?
It started in Roman times as a pagan ritual to Lupercalia.
I know this because my daughter did a report on it for school.
The men of the towns would strip naked and run down the streets, beating unmarried women or infertile women, because they thought the beatings would somehow cure them.
Or help find them a husband.
Then, they sacrificed a dog...
That's not true.
It's to celebrate Saint Valentine, the patron saint of love.
ATHENA: Saint Valentine? Ha!
The patron saint of epileptics, not lovers.
You're a liar.
And you are a crazy bitch.
Better than a dead one!
SANDRA: Let me in!
I know you're in there, you piece of garbage!
Hey, stop it.
Where is he?
Ted! Ted!
Miss! Miss, hey!
Hey, who are you?
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Miss!
Okay, what kind of weird, kinky crap does he have You need to calm down.
Now, who are you?
I'm Sandra.
Ted made a Valentine's date with me tonight, and then, he just stood me up.
Ted! You bastard, I know you're here, you cheater!
I used Find My Phone to see where you were!
You signed into your iCloud on my computer like a damn idiot!
I can track you wherever you are in this city.
Where is he? I'm gonna kill him.
No, little late for that, honey.
Ted already gave his heart to someone else.
You were his third date of the evening.
None of which he's gonna make because he's dead.
727-L-30 requesting R. A. units, homicide detectives and backup at my location for a crime scene.
Tell them to send a straitjacket and a horse tranquilizer.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Thanks to you.
Happy Valentine's Day.
: Help me, she's crazy.
It's okay, it's okay. Everything's all right now.
All right, let's get you out of here.
Who is she?
She?
She's his second date.
You girls need to do better at picking men.
ANDERSON: Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol.
These are first-generation antipsychotics.
ATHENA: Poor girl.
All she wanted was to be loved.
We'll take it from here, Sergeant.
Go home and see your husband.
It's Valentine's Day for a few more hours.
Hi.
BOBBY: Hi.
How's he doing?
Mm. Still out of it.
Well, from what I understand, he'd be completely out it if it hadn't been for you.
Ah. Well...
You saved his life.
The surgeon told me you did a pretty impressive job, too.
I'm just mostly trying not to think about it, really.
Listen, you've had a pretty traumatic night.
If you don't want to sit here with him, you don't have to.
I can do that.
No, no, no. I-I do, I want to.
I-I'd love the company, though, if you want to...
Well, some Valentine's Day, huh?
Super romantic.
Well, it's one he'll never forget.
No. It was all going so great, until I had to cut a hole in his throat.
Valentine's Day rarely works out the way you expect it to.
You know, that's life. You got to roll with what comes.
Don't know what's around the corner.
Spoken like a true first responder.
No, it's straight out of the handbook.
Yeah. Yes.
Yeah, I remember.
Seem like you could use a cup of coffee.
That's okay, right? I mean, you can't choke on that, can you?
Well, clearly you've never had the coffee from here before.
I'll risk it.
All right.
* One night to be confused * One night to speed up truth * We had a promise made * Four hands and then away
* Both under influence * We had divine sense * To know what to say * Mind is a razor blade
* To call for hands of above * To lean on * Wouldn't be good enough * For me, no
* One night of magic rush * The start: a simple touch * One night to push and scream * And then relief
* Ten days of perfect tunes * The colors red and blue * We had a promise made, we were in love. 
 @@@@@@
HEN: 4.5 billion years ago, an astral body the size of Mars slammed into the Earth.
The debris that flew from our planet became stuck in Earth's gravity and formed our moon. That's right.
The moon is just a part of the Earth, separated forever, always drawn back towards us, longing to reconnect.
It is said to increase fertility, create chaos and cause people to do things they would never normally do.
No one knows why things get so weird when the moon is full, why it makes people act so crazy.
All I know is that on this job, the one night you need to be ready for anything is a night when the moon is full.
You, uh, want to watch a Ray Donovan?
I wish, but...I have to get my sleep tonight.
It's gonna be a full moon tomorrow and it's always crazy.
I need to make sure that I am rested.
Well, maybe we could have some close time.
It'll help you sleep.
It'll take a whole lot longer than an episode of Ray Donovan to finish.
Not for me.
I don't mind doing the extra work to get you across the finish line.
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade.
I love you, baby.
Mm-hmm.
You are the most beautiful, sexy, powerful woman I've ever seen, but tonight I got to get my sleep, babe.
LBD.
Karen, don't say that.
I'm just tired.
Lesbian Bed Death.
Doesn't matter how hot a couple is for each other.
Eventually, we all succumb to it.
Come on. I get what I need.
Like, don't you feel the magic when we're cuddling?
I've just been in relationships that have been more like sisterhoods before.
If we're not having sex, then what exactly is it that makes us a couple?
Okay.
Just let me get my rest tonight...
Uh-huh.
...and when I come home after work tomorrow, we'll crawl into bed.
It'll still be a full moon.
And who knows what kind of crazy stuff might happen?
Oh.
Tomorrow. Okay.
* I see the bad moon a-rising * I see trouble on the way...
All right, folks, coming through.
Excuse me, please.
Hi.
Hi.
What you doing there?
I'm gonna have to take you out if that's okay with you.
All right. You'll be fine.
* Well, it's bound to take your life *
* There's a bad moon on the rise...*
Hi. Are you ready?
Yeah? Watch your head.
Oh, I got you.
I got you.
Thank you.
I can't believe they didn't have a key for this.
Don't worry. It's, uh, it's one of those nights.
And here. Congratulations on your moo-moo.
Here we go.
911, what's your emergency?
You're such a dork.
You're a cute dork, but you're a dork.
BUCK: A cute dork.
Okay. I'll take that.
ABBY: How are you feeling? How's your first day back?
I feel great.
Uh, no pain, got minor discomfort, but, uh, don't you worry.
I have someone monitoring my bread intake.
I'm so relieved.
So, when are we gonna do this again?
I mean dinner, not the tracheotomy.
I don't know.
Um, I have a run of shifts, but I will check the schedule.
Are you buckling in?
Uh, am I buckling in?
Oh, full moon.
It's gonna get bumpy.
Uh, no. I do not buy into all that full moon BS.
Whoa, "buy into"? No, no, no.
It Every full moon, the freaks come out.
Crime increases, emergency rooms are packed, animals and kids go nuts.
No, in my experience, anyone who's gonna be an idiot on the full moon is gonna be an idiot on the half moon or the quarter moon or the no moon.
There is no statistical evidence that any crime or accidents...or general freakiness increase during the full moon.
Abby, I just pulled a kid out of one of those stuffed animal arcade games.
I know, but that would've happened whether it was a full moon or not.
Mm, you don't know that.
I do know that.
How many full moons have you worked?
Um, one.
Right. Bye, Buck.
No, wait, hold on.
Hold on. Look, I'm telling you.
All right? Freaks come out.
Now you call me when the night's over, okay?
Bye, Buck. Bye.
911, what's your emergency?
There's a man outside my house. I don't know what he wants.
What's he doing, ma'am? Is he trying to get in?
No. No, he's just standing there.
He's looking at me.
I can't see his eyes, but I can feel them.
Why is he here?
It's okay, ma'am.
Can you tell me your name and address, please?
Nora Curtis. 3942 Rosewood.
ABBY: I'm dispatching police to your location, Nora.
Can you describe the man for me?
I can't see his face.
He doesn't have a face.
Why doesn't he have a face?
Nora...
I can't, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe. I can't...
It's so tight. I can't breathe.
It's okay. All right, help is on the way, Nora.
Just stay on the line with me.
They called you for a prowler?
Homeowner has a heart condition.
ATHENA: Well, you two traveling a little light.
Yeah, a full moon.
Only way to survive is divide and conquer.
Hmm, I believe it's your enemy you're supposed to divide, not yourself.
All right, I'm-a check around back.
Okay.
Paramedics.
The paramedics are here.
Thank you, Abby.
You're welcome, Mrs. Curtis.
Nora.
You're welcome, Nora.
While I was waiting for you, he just seemed to disappear.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Blood pressure's dropping.
Was I having a heart attack?
No, no, no.
Looks more like a panic attack.
He gave me such a fright...
standing out there...
just staring.
You're okay now. All right?
Now, ma'am, I want you to breathe for me, nice and slow, not too deep, and when you exhale, I want you to purse your lips like this.
Okay.
You're safe now.
Full moon. Brings out the creeps and the crazies.
Breathe, okay?
Breathe.
Ma'am, is this where you were standing Yes.
Ma'am, I'm Sergeant Grant.
If there was someone outside, they're gone now.
Thank you.
'Thena.
ATHENA: Yeah?
It look to you like anybody had been outside?
No. I mean, the ground's wet. Didn't see any footprints.
I did.
She says that she was standing pretty much right over here.
He was in the house.
Standing right behind her.
Okay. I just got the chills.
He didn't attack her, though.
Maybe that wasn't his intent or maybe when she called 911 it spooked him, but it looks like he came in the front door.
Ma'am, uh, you mind if I take a look around the inside?
Oh, no. Go ahead.
Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight?
Someone you can call?
Why?
You think he's coming back?
You've been through a lot tonight.
It might be best if you had some company, that's all.
I could call my daughter.
That's a great idea.
All clear here. Pulse is good.
DISPATCHER: P/R, unconscious male.
MacArthur Park. Subject appears to be unresponsive.
CHIMNEY: Copy. Paramedic 118 responding.
That's a dicey neighborhood.
I'll give you a police escort.
Thanks.
Ma'am, I have an officer out front.
He'll stay there until your daughter picks you up.
That's wonderful. Thank you.
Remember to breathe.
I will. Thank you.
Absolutely. You just rest, okay?
You're good now.
Thank you both.
You want to tell me what that was all about?
I'll tell you in the truck.
911, what's your emergency?
There's a man. He's trying to break in.
He's trying to break down the door!
What's your address, ma'am?
837 Harper.
What's your name?
Kathy.
Kathy, where are you now?
I...I...I locked the front door and I'm upstairs in the bedroom.
Is there anyone else with you?
No, nobody.
He-He's in the house.
He-he broke through the door.
Okay, Kathy.
Kathy, are you still there?
Uh-huh.
Okay. Stay on the phone. Lock the bedroom door if you can.
He's at the door. He's at the door.
He's here, he's here!
Okay, okay, Kathy, tell him you've called 911 and the police are on their way.
I-I-I'm on...
I'm on with 911.
The police are coming.
Kathy.
Why are you here? Why are you here?
Why are you here? Why? Why!
Oh, my God.
It's a fact. Gravity is heavier during full moons; scientists have proven it.
You read this in a peer-reviewed, scientific publication?
Uh, I don't know, is the Internet considered a "scientific publication"?
Buck, the idea that the moon causes odd behavior and happenings goes back to the first century.
It's folklore, magical thinking.
Hey. She's this way.
Jackie's six months pregnant. She's new.
This class is only open to moms who are at least 26 weeks.
I warn them about overexerting themselves.
And behold, the Salabhasana.
Yeah, Locust Pose.
I've dated, like, 50 yoga instructors.
BOBBY: Can you guys please clear out so we can get in there.
Ladies, back to your mats.
Thank you, thank you.
I'll take it.
JACKIE: I can't move.
Everything hurts.
The baby, is he okay?
Okay, we're gonna check your baby right now.
Okay? I'm gonna touch you right here on your stomach.
Ooh.
Okay. There's no trauma to the abdomen.
Vitals seem normal.
Fetal heartbeat's normal.
Okay, good.
Is the baby okay?
Your baby is fine.
Oh, he's not mine.
I'm a surrogate.
Listen, can you tell me where you're feeling your pain?
Is it localized in your back, your arms, your legs?
Arms and legs, but it's-it's the worst in my butt and down my thigh and calf.
Okay, I think you slipped a disc.
We're gonna need to get her on her side, okay?
Very carefully support her head.
All right, got it, Bobby.
Let's go this way towards you guys, okay? Very gently.
Oh...
Okay...
All right, I'm gonna take care of that.
I got it.
You take care of this.
I got it. Go, go, go.
BUCK: Here we go. I got you, I got you.
I think I'm having contractions.
How far along are you?
38 weeks.
38 weeks. Okay.
All right, just keep breathing with your contractions.
Nice and easy, all right? What's your name?
Beth.
Okay, I need a cup of water for Beth.
I think it's Braxton Hicks, it's a soft labor.
That means your contractions are gonna go away once we get you nice and relaxed and hydrated, okay?
Okay. Mm-hmm.
Just take a drink.
Oh, my God. My water broke.
* Baby, baby, baby
Yeah, I'm on it.
Uh, Dispatch, requesting additional paramedics to 232 Hope, possible spinal disc herniation.
Need transport to hospital immediately.
It's coming. It's coming now.
Yeah, you only just started contractions, it's okay.
No, this is my fourth kid. It's coming.
Uh, okay, I need towels! I need towels!
Please, she's almost there.
Okay, these contractions are a minute apart.
This isn't soft labor, is it?
No. You're having your baby.
Oh, my God, can I go to the hospital?
With contractions this close together, I can't bring you to the hospital.
Transporting you's too risky right now.
But you're in good hands.
I've delivered babies before.
Okay.
Oh, no, no, not now.
Seriously? I'm not...Bob, I've never done this before.
It's okay. I will talk you through it.
They say when a full moon's halfway between the eastern horizon and its highest point, it can induce labor.
I knew I should have canceled this class.
Just saying, I did tell you.
Okay, we can discuss the moon later, Buck.
If you're not in labor right now, could you please go out in the hallway and give us some space. Thank you.
I have two, possibly three women in labor.
Membranes have ruptured.
Labor is progressing rapidly.
I need a couple of extra transports to the hospital.
Okay, Beth, I need you to push, okay?
I want my epidural!
Hey, Beth, you're doing great.
Okay, he's crowning.
Buck, I need a towel.
Coming. Got it.
* Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby * Baby, baby, I'm on a...*
Okay, okay, Beth, I just need one last big push.
Okay. All right, you have a beautiful baby girl.
Will you save the placenta? I want to freeze it.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay, I got it.
Okay. And cut.
All right.
Good job.
All right.
Yeah, she's in this with you.
Yeah, meet your mama. There you go.
Oh, thank you.
All right, she knows.
* All right Oh, my God.
Okay.
BUCK: All right.
All right. Okay.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I got her, I got her, I got her. Go ahead.
Okay.
Yep. Yep.
Okay, just breathe.
Um, okay...
Uh, just-just keep on breathing. Um...
Oh, my God, just go. I got this.
You're gonna deliver your own baby?
Yes, I told you, it's my fourth.
And she's a doula.
Okay, uh, okay.
Okay, okay. What are you feeling?
Something's wrong.
I didn't feel like this with my last baby.
How tall are you?
Four foot 11.
Did your doctor ever tell you anything about the size of the baby? Is it big or...?
Yeah, he's big.
He's big. Okay.
I saw the ultrasound. His head is huge.
Okay, I think you're experiencing something called CPD, cephalopelvic disproportion.
That means your baby's head is too big for your pelvis.
But you're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you an emergency C-section.
You're gonna be fine.
Guys, come on in.
Oh, God.
Right here.
Is my baby gonna be okay?
We need to call my husband.
The baby's gonna be fine and so are you.
Slow, slow, slow.
We'll call your husband on the way.
There's no rush.
Hey, don't push. There you go.
* Got me down in misery
It's a boy.
Yes.
Well, I'm Buck, and that's Bobby, just in case you want to name him after us.
You know, in our honor or something.
No, I don't think so.
You still think this full moon stuff is a myth?
Yes, and I still think you're an idiot.
St. Matthews, contact OB surgical on call, we've got an emergency C-section coming in, four minutes out.
How you holding up?
Um, hmm, just pissed...
that I can't seem to shake this.
Just keep hearing her screaming.
It's okay if you want to go home.
I can cover you.
Not gonna leave you in a lurch.
On the full moon, which I don't even really believe in.
There's a detective here.
He wants to hear the call, Abby.
What kind of detective?
Homicide.
SUE: This is Abby Clark.
She took the call.
Detective Marks.
Nice to meet you.
You wanted to hear the tape.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Uh, I've read the fast transcript, but, uh, reading isn't the same as hearing.
No. It isn't. Come this way.
KATHY: Why are you here?! Why are you here?!
Why!
Well, thank you, Ms. Clark.
Welcome.
What were you hoping to hear?
Well, things sometimes get missed in the transcripts.
I was hoping...
You might hear his voice?
Hard to hear anything under these screams, even if he had said something.
Maybe I could dig it out if it's there.
I mean, if that would help you guys find him.
Oh, we've already caught him.
Oh.
Yeah, the ex-husband.
She'd been granted multiple protective orders against him.
And he had been charged with domestic battery on more than one occasion.
She was afraid of him.
Has he confessed?
No. They, uh, they generally don't.
Now, if I had his voice on that tape, it'd make things a little bit easier, but, um, at least he's off the streets.
He's not going anywhere for now.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Good luck with it.
Thank you.
Hey, Terry.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you check the system for any 911 calls made from that number or address in the last...three years?
Sure.
Thanks.
911. What's your emergency?
KATHY: Yes, my name is Kathy Blake.
I'm at 837 Harper, and my ex-husband is outside my front door.
TRENT: Open the door!
His name is Trent McConnell and he's not supposed to be within 50 yards of this house.
TRENT: Open the door, you bitch. I want my stuff.
KATHY: Trent, you psycho, I'm on the phone with the cops.
Keep doing what you're doing if you want to spend the night in jail again.
Ma'am, I've dispatched officers to your location.
KATHY: I swear to God, I am holding a butcher knife, and if you come through that door before the police get here, I will use it.
He's at the door. He's at the door!
He's here, he's here!
Trent, you psycho, I'm on the phone with the cops.
Keep doing what you're doing if you want to spend the night in jail again.
Why are you here?! Why are you here?!
Why!
It's not the husband.
They got the wrong guy.
911, what's your emergency?
Yeah, there's a dude running around tossing garbage cans, kicking cars...
Oh! He just knocked some homeless guy out cold!
Where, sir?
Temple-Beaudry. He's...hold on...what's he doing?
Sir?
Oh my god! Get someone down here now!
So, basically, it's a twist on "the call came from inside the house." Only it was a reflection and there was no call, so it's nothing like that at all.
I don't know, a full moon...maybe it was a spirit.
Spirits don't leave muddy footprints.
You don't know that. What if it was raining in purga...
Chimney, stop talking.
CHIMNEY: Copy that.
Go. I got this.
WOMAN: Get off him! Stop!
Help! Somebody help!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Slowly turn around and show me your hands!
What the hell is this kid on?
Probably bath salts.
It's a crazy mix of chemicals that causes violent, psychotic behavior.
ATHENA: Step away from the man.
Are you hearing me?!
Turn around slowly.
Did you see a weapon? I don't see anything.
I'm not sure, I don't...No, I don't think so.
ATHENA: I'm not gonna ask you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good.
Yeah. Go. Make sure that guy's okay.
Detectives want statements from both of us.
It's all you, Chim.
Do I refer to the guy as the perp or the face eater?
This is Hen.
EVA: Well, it better be.
I called her cell phone.
Who is this?
Palmar Women's Correctional Facility.
To accept the charges, please press one.
Yeah, I'm out, baby.
No thanks to you.
Eva, listen, about that...
Relax, I'm just messing with you.
I put you in an awkward position, I know.
I apologize.
Okay, well, thanks for understanding.
A week.
I wanted to make sure I had my footing before I called you, so I got a job at a small tax firm.
You know, it's just an entry-level thing, but if I work hard, I can climb my way up.
That's great.
Um, listen, you-you kind of caught me at a bad...
Come over.
Come on.
Come celebrate. I want to show you my new place.
It's not much, but, uh, it's got a bed.
You're awful.
I know.
So come over and let me apologize for being so awful.
Maybe I can, uh, put you in another awkward position.
Uh -- um, listen, I'm-I'm glad you're home, and that, you know, you're-you're doing well.
Um, I am.
But, uh, I got to go.
Everything all right?
Yeah, well, it is for now.
I mean, so far, no one's questioning whether or not it was justified.
Hell, I wasn't gonna let that monster eat my face.
You know, it's gonna be a long night.
Back to the station, talk to OIS and the DA, and then, back here, walk them through it.
Probably have to ride the desk for a couple of days till the DA is satisfied there's nothing here.
Hmm. I got your back if they come calling.
You always do.
That wasn't your wife on the phone, was it?
Mm, no, it wasn't.
Everything all right at home?
It's fine.
"Fine," huh?
Mm-hmm.
ATHENA: Mm.
Hen.
Now, you know I love you.
All right? Glass house, all that jazz.
But my advice, you let it go long enough, ain't no coming back from "fine." Everything was fine in my marriage until the bomb went off.
Athena, I appreciate your concern, but we're good.
Karen's not a bomb waiting to go off.
I wasn't talking about her.
TRENT: ...my stuff!
KATHY: Trent, you psycho!
I'm on the phone with the cops. Just keep doing what you're doing if you want to spend the night in jail again.
Well?
Right. This just confirms it.
He had been harassing her for years.
Oh, yeah, but don't you hear the difference between the two calls?
I mean, when she was with her ex-husband, she was upset, but she was pushing back.
You know, she was fighting him.
And she called him by his name.
Tonight, she didn't mention a name, and it was completely different.
It was like...blind terror.
Because she finally realized what he was capable of.
It's dark, her focus is split 'cause she's talking to you.
She may not have realized it was her ex until it was too late.
You know, a woman with a history like that, I mean, if a guy's trying to break in, she's gonna presuppose that it's her ex.
That's not the guy who came in tonight.
Look, it's clear you care about what you do.
I imagine you're not used to losing one.
I got to believe, hearing someone die like that?
Not an easy thing to just shake off.
Well, I take over 200 emergency calls in a ten-hour shift.
I don't just shake them off, I move on.
'Cause there's always another call to move on to.
And I listen to every single one.
And I know what I'm hearing here.
Here's what I know.
All right? 99% of the time, the guy you think did it did it.
It's my job to find the evidence to prove it.
And my job is to listen, and hear what people tell me, and hear what they don't tell me, and hear everything that goes on around them.
I'm telling you, the person who killed that woman tonight is still out there.
It wasn't her ex-husband.
You can go ahead and include this and any other calls from the victim in what you're sending to us.
We'll consider everything.
Okay.
Well, at least he didn't pat me on the head.
It's with the police, now.
Well, you may not have convinced him, but you convinced me.
I think there's something else you should hear.
KATHY : Yes. My name is Kathy Blake.
I'm at 837 Harper, and my ex-husband is outside my front door.
WOMAN : ...about the restraining order.
You hear that?
Here, let me dig it out.
Yes. My name is Kathy Blake.
I'm at 837 Harper, and my ex-husband is outside my front door.
WOMAN: Tell them about the restraining order.
There's somebody else there?
KATHY: ...outside my front door.
WOMAN: Tell them about the restraining order.
A woman.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know what it gets you, exactly.
It gets us eyes in the room.
I mean, somebody who can tell us if Trent McConnell would even be capable of this.
Because the only other person in the room is dead.
So FID and the DA's office will run their investigations and present it to the board.
Until they make their final determination, you're riding a desk.
Yeah, I know the protocol.
Listen, Sergeant, no one wants to jam you up here.
But it hasn't been that long since you got off restricted desk duty.
So just don't give them a reason.
If they come back to you with more questions, you call me first.
It was a good shoot, Athena.
I got your back, okay?
Yeah. Thanks, Jerry.
All right.
Yeah. Athena Grant.
ABBY: Sergeant.
It's Abby Clark calling.
Abby.
So how's your night?
Oh, you know...a little unsettling tonight.
More unsettling than performing an emergency tracheotomy on a first date?
You heard about that?
Yeah, girl.
All right, what can I do for you tonight?
ABBY: I'm trying to track down a police report.
I need to find a witness on an old domestic call.
Yeah.
October 29, 2015.
837 Harper.
Call came in just before midnight.
So what's got you unsettled tonight?
Home break-in turned murder.
I might have you beat.
I saw a man high on bath salts eating another man's face.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh, man, I'm starting to buy into all this full moon crap.
Still haven't seen no werewolves.
Okay, I got a Kathleen Blake, filed a complaint against her estranged husband Trent McConnell.
Yeah, that's-that's it. That's the one.
And I may have just found your witness.
That's weird.
Nora Jane Curtis.
I had a P/R by the same name earlier tonight.
No, wait.
No, a different Nora Curtis.
This one's 30 years younger.
Wait, I took that call.
There was a prowler outside the house.
Except he wasn't outside, he was inside.
She just didn't know it.
Looked like a creep and peep.
Didn't want to scare her any more than she already was, so we suggested she spend the night someplace else.
Said she was gonna call her daughter.
The younger Nora Curtis?
NORA: This couch is fine for me, dear.
I will not put you out of your own bed.
Seriously, Mom, we're not having this conversation again.
I don't want you sleeping on the couch with your back.
Hello?
ABBY: Uh, hi, am I speaking with Nora Jane Curtis?
Yes. Who is this?
This is Abby Clark, I'm a 911 operator.
I think I spoke to your mother earlier tonight.
You did. She's here.
Are you actually checking up?
That's so awesome.
It's the 911 operator.
Abby?
That is so sweet.
I didn't know they did that.
ABBY: Something happened tonight to an acquaintance of yours, Kathleen Blake.
Kathy? She's not just an acquaintance.
She saved my life. What happened?
Uh, I'm so sorry, I can't disclose the details of that.
Can you tell me what you mean when you say she saved your life?
Mm, Kathy runs a support group for survivors of domestic violence.
She herself is a victim of abuse, and she gave me the courage to finally escape.
I mean, she even helped me rent a place where my ex couldn't find me.
Does your ex Yes.
She let me stay with her a few times when things got bad.
What's going on?
Okay, I need you to give me your address where are you right now, please.
Oh, God.
11207 Collins, North Hollywood.
ABBY: The police think Kathy was attacked by her ex-husband tonight...but I think it was your ex-husband, and he's been looking for you.
Oh, my God.
It's him, he's here.
He found me. How did he find me?
Did he do something to Kathy?
Nora Jane, stay on the line.
Okay? Help is on the way.
MAN: Nora Jane!
What's happening, Nora Jane?
Nora Jane?!
Nora Jane!
He's in the house.
Police are two minutes out.
MAN: I told you I'd find you, you bitch!
I don't know what's going on.
MAN: I told you.
You can't hide forever.
NORA JANE: I'm done hiding.
Nora Jane?
Nora Jane?
NORA JANE: I think he's dead.
What?
What happened? We're fine.
I was ready for him this time.
Thanks to you.
Good.
Good, well, help is on the way.
She's okay. Okay.
911, what's your emergency?
Please send someone! There's something inside of me!
I'm sorry, did you say there's something inside you?
Connor?
Connor, open the door, let me in.
CONNOR: Absolutely not. Go away.
Sir, are you in danger?
Is there someone trying to get into your house?
CONNOR: No! There's something inside of me. I can feel it.
Sir, what is your address, please?
I can feel it moving. What is happening?
What is your address, sir? I need your address.
CONNOR: Oh, what is happening?
There's a monster inside of me!
Damn it, Connor.
Let me in.
Go away.
You're scaring me.
I'm John Hurt in Alien right now.
Oh. Thank God. : Help.
Connor? 911's here.
Open the door now.
All right, step aside, sir.
Connor? Los Angeles Fire Department.
We can't help you if you don't open the door.
Connor, I don't want to have to break this door down.
Can you tell me what you're feeling?
Something's happening. It's, like, the...
like, the worst cramping pressure feeling that I've ever experienced -- it's like I'm gonna give birth or something.
Oh, stop it. We had sushi tonight.
He always orders the omakase, but he can't handle anyone telling him what to do, so he orders more...
You just have an upset stomach.
If you tell me I just have a stomachache one more time, I'm gonna stab you with your toothbrush.
I swear, I felt it moving, okay? I felt something moving.
How long have you been having the cramps?
Uh, about a week.
Yeah, I made a doctor's appointment for Friday.
No.
Oh, he's been having a lot of gas.
Shut up!
You have.
I mean, i-it kind of builds like an overture, and then there's a nice little tuba solo.
It's a tremendous amount of horrible flatulence.
Paul.
Okay, just lean back, let me have a look.
Okay.
He does -- about four or five times a week.
I try to go carb- and fat-free as often as possible.
Ah, same here. You guys ever try the brown rice pasta?
You know, it's not that bad.
You know, it's a little gummy for my taste.
I see that.
Yeah.
Hey, what's your body fat percentage?
I swing between, like, 50...
Okay, can we finish the most interesting conversation of all time later?
No.
What about your bowel movements? Any diarrhea?
No.
Yes. Why would you lie to him about that? He's trying to help you.
Okay. Sorry. Yes.
He has poop shame.
Okay. Just take a deep breath, okay Take a deep breath.
Oh, my God! No, no, no!
I'm gonna burst! I'm gonna explode!
Let's get him in the ambulance right...
God, just make it stop!
Drive faster. I feel like I'm gonna explode all over the place.
All right, Connor, you're doing great.
We're almost to the hospital. They're gonna do a scan, figure out exactly what's going on.
Th-There's something under my leg.
It's just the IV tube, all right? It's underneath you.
No, no, no, it's moving. There's something moving under my leg.
All right, let's turn him and check it out.
Oh!
That's a tapeworm.
I have a tapeworm?!
Wait, it's coming out of his...
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, get it out. Get it out!
Oh, I can see the mouth.
I mean, we can pull it out.
No. No, no, absolutely not.
We're almost to the hospital -- they're gonna remove that with the proper instruments, put him on some albendazole, and then we call it a night.
No, please, no. I can't take those drugs.
They're toxic. They put me on Flagyl for diverticulitis once, and it gave me severe heartburn and turned my pee burnt sienna.
I'm sorry, burnt sienna?
It was brown! Okay? It was dark brown.
Now, just please, I am begging you, get it out!
It's all you, Buck.
Really? So you have no problem delivering a baby, but this creeps you out?
Seniority has its advantages.
Just get it out...
Okay.
What are you waiting for? Get it out.
I have to be careful, all right?
If it breaks, it'll crawl back inside and regenerate.
Oh...
I'm definitely gonna puke.
I knew you didn't go from a 34 to a 31 waist with sit-ups.
Tapeworms are an old fashioned model's trick for losing weight.
You know, these things can live inside of you for, like, 20 years?
Ugh!
PAUL: This is insane -- it's like a magician's handkerchief.
Actually, it kind of makes perfect sense.
All the sushi you guys eat.
It's like playing Russian roulette with parasites.
And with the moon -- parasitic breeding cycles rise and fall with the full moon.
Will you shut up about the moon?
I honestly don't know how you're so calm about this.
It's nature, you know?
Circle of life.
PAUL: Yeah, I don't think that's what Elton John had in mind when he wrote that.
Man, this has to be, like...six or seven feet.
Oh, God.
Have you been worn down lately? This thing has been stealing all your nutrients.
How do you know so much about tapeworms?
I tended bar one summer at a surf beach in South America.
These things are as common...as...
Oh! Oh!
...housecats.
Oh, God.
Whoa.
Congratulations, Connor.
It's a boy.
Abby?
Hi, Detective.
Ms. Clark, I'm, uh...
well, I'm glad I caught you before you left.
I, uh...
Well, I wanted to apologize in person.
Oh.
You didn't have to do that.
No, I do. Uh, I had the wrong man, you tried to tell me, and...I didn't listen.
And I still can't figure out how you put all the pieces together.
I had a lot of help.
And...I do think it was lucky that I got that first call from the intended victim's mother.
Other than that, I'm not really sure how all the pieces go together, either.
Well, we think the suspect broke into the mother's house probably expecting that's where his ex-wife was staying.
And once he found she wasn't there, well, he went to the person he held responsible for her leaving.
Kathleen Blake.
Yeah. We found her laptop in his car -- that's...how he got the address.
I mean, I'm just glad he didn't do the same thing to Nora Jane's mother.
Well, Nora Jane says her ex always liked the old lady, had a...
well, a soft spot for her.
People are strange.
That's one way of looking at it, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, thank you again.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Yeah.
* Girl, are you sittin' down?
I'm-I'm driving home. Why, something's up?
I'm looking at this tox report -- you're not gonna believe it.
The face eater?
Nothing but alcohol in his system.
No MDPV, no methylone, methedrone.
No cathinone of any kind.
What? So this guy was just out here eating people's faces 'cause he felt like it?
I guess he really was hungry.
I mean, his blood sugar levels were low.
There was a Burger King a block away.
Girl, it must be the full moon.
Athena, I gotta go.
'Kay. All right, you be careful out there, full moon or not.
This is one of those nights people act like fools.
Yeah, you, too.
You changed your mind.
You look good.
Freedom agrees with me.
* I should go home now.
So what's stopping you?
I don't know.
Hi.
So, I was driving home, and I hit a red light.
Uh, and I looked up at the moon...um...
and before I knew it, I was pulling into a liquor store to buy us this bottle of wine.
And then I drove straight here.
Did the moon cast a spell on you?
It's real.
It's gravity.
* And all the time we thought we did *
And it pulls people together.
Mm, no, actually -- you know this, right? -- the phases of the moon are caused by its positioning relative to the sun and the sun's shadow, like, it doesn't actually get I don't think that's actually true.
Oh, no, that's definitely true.
Yeah. Really.
Um, well, even better.
You know? 'Cause...then science got nothing to do with it.
It's magic.
Mm, nope.
Not magic, either.
* Maybe it's not science or magic.
* I held your hand until the light *
Maybe you just really wanted to see me.
* The scars were on the back * And all the time we were the right *
* Was it just retract?
* And they can try to put you down *
* Wear you out * Get you through the idea of the luck *
* Well, I thought you were the sweetest kill *
* Did we even know?
* All the time, we get by * Trying to figure out our lives...*
HEN: People who are drawn together don't have the protection of the laws of gravity to keep them apart.
* All the time...
The consequences don't matter when we're drawn to one another.
All that matters is the power of that touch.
Skin to skin.
* We get by * Trying to figure out our lives *
* Like a fade-out...
* But there are always consequences.
Eventually, the moon sets and the sun rises, and whatever happened in the magic of that moonlight has to face the hard truth...of the light of day.
 @@@@@@
911, what's your emergency?
I've been shot.
Sir?
DISPATCHER: Sir, are you there?
Sir, can you hear me Sir?
We've been here before.
Before you joined us, kid.
HEN: Chimney, you're almost there!
Coming. Coming. Coming.
Help me out here.
All right, watch her head.
Okay. Got it.
Why would she do something like this?
I'm sorry.
DANFORD: Whatever it was, we could have talked about it.
I could have helped her. I loved her.
I imagine she wasn't eager to run into your loving arms.
We had our differences.
Clearly.
Now, my wife liked to use this tree for target practice.
DANFORD: I'm not gonna ask you again.
Where were you last night? Do not walk away from me.
Hey!
You do this to yourself.
You realize that?
What do you want to hear, honey?
Huh That I screwed his brains out in the car?
Will that make you feel better for hitting me?
Why would you get a gun?
Don't take another step, Dan. I will shoot you.
I swear I will.
Well, look at you.
All brave.
Oh, I'm not brave.
I'm just so pissed at myself for letting you rip me away from my life and control me!
Pull the trigger.
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
Shoot.
Shoot, shoot, shoot! Damn it...
You want out so bad, you're gonna have to shoot yourself, not me.
DANFORD: Look.
It's still standing.
And she's not.
MAN: I really can't explain it.
Fungus took hold, spread like cancer.
Was she exposed to any foreign objects?
DANFORD: She got sick after being struck by a bullet.
MAN: That's weird. Tree this size?
Come on. There's nothing you can do?
MAN: Truth be told, she should have been leveled months ago.
It's a damn shame.
A lot of good memories with this tree.
Well, I can get you an estimate by the end of the day.
Don't bother.
* The bullet she fired at him...did it fly out of the tree when he blew it up?
Karma's a bitch.
* So I want to thank everybody for donating today.
I don't know if you know this or not, but 90% of all the blood given to patients in the Los Angeles area comes from volunteers.
I know that we all put our asses on the line in the field every day to save people, but today, you're saving people, and all it's taking is a tiny prick of a needle.
So simple, even Mr. Buckley can't mess that up.
How'd you do?
Incredible.
Everyone donated. Some people even came in on their day off.
That's great. All right, well, let's wrap it up.
We got to start our shift.
Uh, hold up.
Looks here like I am two pints shy of my goal for the day.
Well, that'll give you something to work towards next time.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're the captain of this house, and you're the only one who didn't participate.
I don't like needles, end of story.
Oh, come on. Captain, come on.
You got to donate.
I don't give blood.
All right? I never give blood. When I was a kid, they tried to take my blood, and I bit the doctor.
It's not funny.
And the one time someone tried to take my blood as an adult...didn't go well.
Bobby? Bobby, hold...wait. Hold on. Hold on.
All right, listen, I get it. I really do, okay?
But I really need you to do this for me, all right?
Look...I'm alive because that rebar hit my head at just the right angle, and because I had the best damn fire and rescue team to get me to the hospital and the best surgeons in the world once I got there.
But I got ten pints of blood, donated blood, given by the very generous people of this city.
Now, I told you, I just...I wanted to do this blood drive 'cause I wanted to give a little something back of what I was given.
And expressing my gratitude like this -- it balances me out with the universe.
Now, you and everybody else here asked me how they could help with my recovery.
Well, this is how.
I hate all of you.
Thank you. Thank you.
You love us.
Here, you're gonna need this.
Just squeeze it.
CHIMNEY: All right, let's stick him!
All right, let's get it.
Hey. All right, get in there. Get in there.
There you go.
Mwah.
Hey.
I am proud of us.
What we're trying to do here -- I tell you.
And what is it exactly we trying to do?
Because I keep forgetting.
Well, be a family, for better or worse.
Adapt to our circumstance.
You know, everyone says that they put their kids first, but we are actually doing it.
I want to take the kids out this weekend.
Yeah.
Please. We've already taken them to your mother's.
Athena, I've been seeing Glenn now for some time, and I want the kids to meet him. I-I want you to meet him.
Absolutely not. They say you should wait a year before you introduce your kids to someone, and that's under the best of circumstances.
What, you think they're ready to see you sitting at dinner holding hands with another man?
Well, they need to see me for who I am.
Says who? Look, I know you're ready to come out and change your whole world, but the rest of us aren't.
God, it's not like he's moving in.
You know, I just thought that if we all go out for ice cream and maybe have a conversation...
And then what? Is he coming over for Sunday dinner?
Opening presents under the Christmas tree?
He's a stranger to us.
So I guess you want to have a background check before he's around the kids?
Couldn't hurt.
I met him on the Wilshire project.
He's a contractor.
Went to USC. He's decent.
Barely drinks.
Doesn't smoke, no drugs.
And I am hoping that's he's not a stranger for long.
We agreed that this family would change shape, and that we would work together to mold it into something that works for all of us.
I'm trying to move forward, Athena.
Move with me.
Then stop moving so fast.
911, what's your emergency?
I'm at Metro Fitness on Hollywood. My boss is burning up.
Do you mean he's feverish?
No, that is not what I mean!
Okay, so I came in early to turn in my keys and-and pick up my paycheck.
He actually fired me yesterday. It's a whole story.
Anyway, I, um...I smelled something burning.
We all kept trying to tell him to get it fixed.
Oh, my God. I didn't think to do that.
I don't know. He's the owner, so sometimes he comes in before we even open, so two hours, What do you think, Chim Worse. I think he's alive.
Why the hell didn't he just get out?
Might have had a stroke.
He's 32.
We need to know.
I don't know.
32, may have had a stoke; drugs could be an underlying cause.
He was stacking.
He's in V-tach!
Starting compressions.
CHIMNEY: No. He's gone.
Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa. Easy.
It's just too freaky. I mean, after what happened with Mindy.
I told him. I said, "Barry, what goes around comes around." Who's Mindy?
(rock music playing over truck stereo) Barry. Hey.
You can't leave Mindy in there.
No, I won't be long. I'm just doing chest.
She's fine. I cracked the window.
Barry, it's not enough.
Why did you even bring her? Why didn't you just leave her home?
'Cause you know how hyper she gets.
She barks all day. The neighbors have complained.
I'm not supposed to have a dog.
Barry, she is gonna bake.
It's 70 degrees out.
PETA says on a 70 degree day, temperatures inside a parked car can reach a hundred.
Carrie, she's fine.
She's got water.
Barry, dogs can die from heatstroke.
And she's not your dog. You're supposed to be behind the desk.
* I always cross the line * Tightened our belts * Abuse ourselves * Get in our way...
Carrie.
What are you doing?
The tanning bed's fritzing again.
The timer's stuck.
No. I told you there's nothing wrong with it.
You just got to jiggle it.
Oh.
* What comes around goes around. * No, no, no. What the hell did you do?!
I saved your dog.
Here. You're welcome.
You know what?
You come pick up your final paycheck tomorrow morning.
You're fired!
Yep. Karma's a bi...
Please, don't.
This is Bobby.
I-I don't understand why you can't just tell...
Okay, thanks.
That was Cedars.
Is someone sick?
The blood I donated -- they sent it to a lab and had it tested, so...
Well, it's the first time you donated; they have to do that before they release it to the blood supply.
They found something in it.
What do you mean, "found something"?
They wouldn't tell me over the phone.
They said they'd rather do it in person.
BOBBY: I got to show you something, Father.
I haven't shared this with anyone else.
Your prayer book?
I guess it is my prayer book in a way.
A list of names.
62, so far.
62 of 148.
One hundred and forty-eight.
The number of people who died because of me.
These 62 names, these are people whose lives you've saved.
Yeah.
This job, it's the only way I know how to balance the ledger.
Not that I can ever really do that.
But 148 lives, I owe at least that much.
And then I can go.
Bobby, you're aware of the Church's position on suicide.
You're against it.
It would cost you your eternal soul.
I believe in God's justice.
How about his sense of humor?
There's something in my blood.
Something unusual.
The doctor wouldn't tell me over the phone.
He wants to break it to me in person.
I'm sorry.
So I guess the irony is, I may not live long enough to make it to 148, and that scares the hell out of me.
Because that is your penance.
And I don't know if my soul will ever be able to rest in peace if it goes unpaid.

Ow!
911, what's your emergency?
You gotta help me. I can't move. I fell.
I think I broke my hip.
What's your location, ma'am?
Hancock Park. 2312 Woodlyn.
It hurts so bad. Please just tell me someone's on the way!
I hope nothing was breakable in your package.
I don't know. I'm sure it's fine.
Not that you couldn't return it, but the hassle, you know.
Just get me to the hospital. Why aren't we leaving?
We're just not sure if you have a spinal cord injury, and so we're trying to stabilize you.
I told you, I can feel my legs.
I can feel it too much. It hurts!
The cops don't need to be here. I'm fine.
I-I don't want to go to the hospital.
You guys find I. D. on her?
Uh...this must have fallen out of her pocket. Who called you?
One of the neighbors.
Are you trying to suggest that I'm...
There are days when I'd actually enjoy whatever tall tale you're on the cusp of spitting my way.
Where I'd be entertained letting you think that you're smarter than me, even if only for a minute.
But today is nowhere close to being one of them.
I'm the victim here.
I have to get to the hospital.
Oh, you'll get there.
They'll fix your busted hip.
Femur, actually.
And then you'll be charged with grand theft.
Trespassing, too.
Oh.
Your car is still running.
Your driver's license says you live in Van Nuys.
Now, I know you're in agony.
You want them to fix that femur in a timely fashion?
You cut the crap and confirm what I already know.
I don't keep anything.
I just like taking 'em.
I'm supposed to go to a rehab in Arizona, but they won't take my insurance.
(indistinct police radio chatter) Let me guess, if that bee in your bonnet had a name, it'd be Michael.
The guy he's seeing, he wants to start bringing him around, to get to know the kids, and I guess me.
Well, maybe that might be worth giving him a chance.
Hell no.
It might take away a little of the pressure.
Athena, look, I'm just saying this.
Maybe this guy is not all bad.
Michael has a okay track record picking 'em.
I wouldn't care if he's dating the Dalai Lama.
I know.
Michael being with somebody else is a hard thing.
What's hard is that somehow we done decided that's what's best for the kids is that we stay together and try to play happy, modern family.
All that means to me is that Michael gets to keep having the cake of living in my house and eating it, too, coming and going as he pleases.
As far as I can see, the only one doing any heavy emotional lifting here is me.
I'm the one who has to keep pushing my feelings to the side every day.
You got bigger problems than Glenn, Athena.
Kids love their daddies, but they follow their mother's lead.
No matter how good Michael is with those kids, if you hate him...they're gonna hate their daddy.
I know, relationship problems is going around, trust me.
You don't even want to know.
Guys, you think we can hit the road, please?
She's second-guessing everything I'm doing in here.
It's kind of hurting my feelings.
I'll call you later.
All right.
BOBBY: You don't have to be here with me, you know.
Yeah, well, this is all only happening because I'm the one who made you get your blood drawn.
I feel obligated.
Listen, I'm here for you, no matter what that doctor has to say, right Mr. Nash.
Yeah.
Thank you for coming in so quickly.
There are some findings in your blood work that are time sensitive.
He's good.
You can speak freely and directly.
No need to sugarcoat.
Please.
Have you ever heard of rhesus disease?
Uh, no. How bad is it?
It's terrible. Fatal in most cases.
But you don't have it.
It only effects pregnant women and their fetuses.
I'm-I'm sorry. I don't understand.
There are some 4,000 cases of rhesus in newborns each year.
You are almost an identical match to a man in Australia named James Harrison.
For decades, his donated blood saved the lives of more than two million children.
They call him the man with the golden arm.
Now, it seems you have one, too.
If you would fill this out.
We would love to get you into our rare donor's program as soon as possible.
We could set up regular donations.
There are babies at this very moment who need you.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Well, dude, I guess you're gonna have to get over your fear of needles, huh?
We can't see the tigers, Uncle Sean.
They're hiding behind the tree.
All right, all right, all right. Hang on.
Okay.
SEAN: There we go.
ADAM: Direct hit.
Hang on. I'll get him moving.
Did-did you just throw something You're not supposed to taunt the animals.
We're not.
My-my nephew's just trying to get a picture, that's all.
Oh, uh...
Yeah. Yeah, that's the one I want.
SEAN: Uh, come on.
I got to take a leak. Let's go. Go.
Hey! Hey, what happened?
Hey!
What happened?!
Boys?!
ABBY: 911. What's your emergency?
He's, uh...he's just staring at me.
He won't take his eyes off me. It's-it's like he's...it's like he's studying me. Th-This isn't good.
Zoo security's been alerted. They're on their way to you now.
Now's not gonna be soon enough, okay?
I've been on safari. I know how fast these things can move.
Sean, I'm being told your best course is to remain very still.
Sean, tell me what's happening.
Oh, God!
I made it! I'm in the, uh...the-the flamingo thing.
Tell the zoo security I'm in the flamingo thing, all right?
Oh, crap.
East side of the park.
Nowhere near where we're going. He's got a visitor pinned.
Shoot team's en route now.
You're gonna shoot him? That's just not right.
Protocol is to tranquilize first, if at all possible.
How did the tiger escape in the first place?
CARL: Apparently, he was able to jump to the top of the wall and gain enough leverage to pull himself out.
Tiger's trainer tried to wrangle him after he got loose.
This ain't pretty.
It's, uh...it's called degloving.
The-the cat actually peels the skin back with his claws.
Hen, saline.
Sir, we have to disinfect this wound.
How come it didn't just kill you I've known Kobe since he was a cub.
He didn't want to hurt me. He was just...he was just confused.
Okay, if we're real careful, we can preserve the skin.
A little plastic surgery, you're gonna be good as new.
ABBY : All units responding to Barnsdale Zoo.
I have an adult male in distress, east side of the park.
He identified himself as Sean Coopertino, 47, of Riverside.
Says he's hiding near the giraffe enclosure.
Show 727-L-30 responding.
Can't be the same guy, can it? That'll just be too weird.
Same guy as what?
Sean Coopertino. The dentist from Riverside.
Dr. Coopertino, how much did you pay the illegal poachers?
You knew the area was a protected reserve.
Were you aware that Ellie was being tracked and studied by the University of Oxford?
I had no idea it was a protected reserve.
It was a legal hunting trip. Now leave me alone.
Cancel all my appointments.
Get my lawyer on the phone.
("You Oughta Know" by Alanis Morissette playing) Oh.
* Oh-oh, oh-oh * Oh-oh
ABBY: Sean.
* You, you, you oughta know.
Oh, God. Sean.
SEAN: Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
Stay where you are. Security has your GPS location.
They're on their way to you now.
Yeah, okay.
I, uh...I don't see it anymore.
I-I think I outsmarted it.
* SHARPSHOOTER: I got the tiger.
I don't see him. Do you?
I think I see him hiding back there.
ATHENA: I'm not so sure he's hiding.
Tranq him.
(indistinct police radio chatter) SHARPSHOOTER: Yeah, he's down.
HEN: That's a beautiful animal.
Chances are he's gonna have to be put down after this.
Maybe not.
Guess who he had for lunch.
Hmm?
That's that idiot that killed Ellie the Lion.
Mm-hmm.
I think public sentiment is gonna be with the kitty.
You know what karma is.
A bitch.
No.
She's a wild animal, and she won't be caged.
Hey. It's too quiet up in here.
Your dad's waiting on you downstairs with the Pictionary.
Are you on your way out to work?
Yeah, in a little while.
Are you guys having a hard time being with your dad?
No. That's your problem.
Uh, you know, what's going on with your dad and me is complicated.
What he's doing is...is brave, and all of us need to support him.
Your dad and I are trying to keep this family together.
Why?
How is all of us being here, living with you and Dad mad at each other, helping our family?
Dad being gay was hard at first, but we love Dad.
That's not the problem.
So what is?
Making us fake it every day.
And for what?
So you two can pretend that you didn't mess up by marrying each other?
We prefer honesty.
Isn't that what you always taught us?
Hey, Bobby!
So, that guy in Australia, you know, the one with the same blood makeup as you, says here, in 1999, he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for saving those kids.
And what would be our equivalent?
It's got to be the Presidential Medal of Freedom, right?
We should, like, totally put you up for one of those, you know?
I mean, like, at some point.
I gave some blood, Chim.
It doesn't merit a medal. All right?
Let's just drop it.
It's the Presidential Medal of...
All right.
You want to tell me what's chafing you?
Look, I get it.
You don't like needles.
But you're a lifesaver; that's what you do.
You're a hero, man.
And somebody just told you you have the opportunity to save thousands, maybe millions of kids.
They're the wrong kids!
I want my kids!
Yeah, I'm some lifesaver, aren't I?
That's what I was put on this Earth to do, but I couldn't save my family.
Couldn't protect them from me.
A hundred and forty-eight.
That's the number of lives that I owe for the mistakes that I made.
And once I pay that debt, I get to be with them again.
And I was halfway there, Chim. I was halfway there.
I was going to see my kids again. That was the deal.
Deal with who, Bobby?
The deal I made with God.
I don't think it's God you made a deal with, Cap...
And I got that phone call about my blood test, and I thought, "Here we go. Here it is. Here's my punishment: cancer." And for all the prayers I sent up there, so I could live long enough...
You're not talking about killing yourself, are you?
Yeah.
I want out.
I want to see my kids again.
And I want this pain to end, but it's not gonna end.
It's never gonna end.
'Cause God's not punishing me by killing me.
He's punishing me by forcing me to stay alive.
Wait, wait, Bobby. Bobby.
ATHENA: Mm.
Something wrong with that cola?
Hey. Nah.
I keep a cooler in the truck for washing blood away from the scenes once we're done with them.
Cola is the only thing that really works.
It's not in the job description, but I feel like it's the right thing to do.
Victim was D. O. A., by the way.
Victim and suspect.
Guy robs the joint, and then gets hit by a dump truck a few feet from the store.
Hey, what was that thing you wanted to talk to me about?
Athena...
I messed up big-time.
Work or personal?
Personal.
Hmm.
Money or sex?
: Sex.
I slept with Eva.
The hell?
I thought your ex was still in prison.
Paroled, a few weeks ago.
I don't know what came over me.
It was, it was the night of that full moon.
I haven't been able to look Karen in the eye since then.
Well, you got to tell her.
I'm never gonna do it again. It was a mistake.
If anything, it just reminded me that I want to be with my wife.
I told you, I don't want to screw this relationship up.
Your relationship is screwed up already.
You don't cheat on a healthy relationship.
What you did is just evidence of how bad it is.
Now, your telling Karen is your chance at fixing it.
It's only when secrets are revealed that we know how good or bad a marriage is.
Now, trust me...I know.
Sometimes you got to...wreck it in order to save it.
There's a lot of love between the two of you.
Thanks, Athena.
Mmm.
And let me know how it goes.
Thanks for the cola.
Huh?
Oh. Hi, baby. What time is it?
Half past 11:00.
Mm.
We need to talk.
This is the hardest thing I've...I've ever done, but I need to...
do it now while I still love you.
Okay. What is this?
The name and number of my divorce attorney.
Oh, no, Athena. No.
Whoever you get should call him.
Athena.
I love you.
You're my man, the father of my children, my best friend.
This family...is changing.
It is what it is.
But us staying together like this, living in this house, holding on to some picture of what was...it's making me hate you.
If we don't really move on, that hate is gonna be the only thing I feel when I think about you.
Well, what about the kids?
I spoke to them.
This is what they want and need.
Ah.
I'm sorry, Athena.
I'm so sorry for hurting you.
I am.
I will never regret marrying you.
I would do it all over again, everything.
And to have those children and you as a friend, I would suffer all of it a million times.
* You're late.
I'm sorry. I was, I was...just driving around.
I needed to, um...to get my mind right.
About Eva?
She's suing for custody.
That's impossible. Our-our lawyers said that...
According to her, we have an unstable home that's unsuitable to raise a child.
And she's saying the proof of this unstable home is that you slept with her.
Listen, baby, I-I'm sorry.
Let me just, let me, let me just, let me explain.
I'm gonna go pack some things.
I'm taking Denny to my parents'.
Let me just ex...
You put our family at risk.
I don't know what it is that you went there looking for, but I hope you got it.
And I hope it was worth it.
Oh, no, I didn't order this.
From the gentleman.
Oh.
Um...
Oh, God.
* I'm Aaron.
Um, Athena.
I hope you don't mind me sending that over.
Oh, well, no. I just...I just didn't realize that people still did this.
Sending drinks over to break the ice?
I'm pretty sure they haven't stopped doing that.
So how long have you been out of all of this?
Um...it's-it's been a while.
Recently separated.
Mm-hmm.
Two days.
We've been working our way towards it for a while now.
I mean, no hard feelings.
He's, um...he's at home with our kids, so I-I decided to, you know, just get out the house.
Went to a movie...and then I got thirsty.
I just didn't feel like drinking alone.
Mm.
I highly doubt that you being alone is anything you ever have a problem with.
Ooh. Well, aren't you Mr. Smooth?
I would've guessed that was your middle name.
No, no. It's, uh, Chester.
For real?
Oh, your parents hated you right away.
What's your full name?
Aaron Chester Brooks.
Mm. Date of birth?
April 18, 1980.
What are you typing?
Well, I'm a cop.
Sending it to one of my friends at the station, run a check on you.
Mm-hmm.
If we're gonna spend the night talking and drinking, I want to know I'm not wasting my time with a bad egg.
We can toast to that.
Hey, Chimney?
What's going on? You all right?
Uh...come on. I want to show you something.
Come on.
MAN: Her name's Asha.
She's our first.
Uh, this is Steven.
I told him I was bringing you by, and he begged me to let him talk to you.
Bobby.
We never thought we would get to meet her.
Instead, she's starting out life healthy and disease-free.
That's because of you.
That's your blood they rushed over here.
Thank you.
* You got the will of a wild * A wild bird...
Take care.
CHIMNEY: Now you tell me that's the wrong kid.
Look, you're gonna see your own kids again.
I do believe that.
But right now, Asha and a thousand others just like her -- they're your kids, too.
That's your blood in their veins.
So you look at her, you look at her and those young parents, and you tell me if that feels like a punishment.
No, Chim. It's a blessing.
Exactly.
I think you better either throw that book of yours away or get yourself a bigger one, 'cause it seems to me like you're here to stay.
Looks that way.
And just think, you'll only have to give blood once.
Every eight weeks.
For the rest of your life.
Oh, God.
Could you explain to me again how God's not punishing me?
Oh, he's just teasing you.
Yeah.
* You got some kind...
Considering who I work with, he must figure I can take a joke.
* You got some kind * You got some kind of love * You got some kind * You got some kind * You got some kind of love.

911, what's your emergency?
Help me! I'm stuck in a garbage truck!
You're locked in a garbage truck?
I can't move my legs, I can't get out!
It's gonna crush me! Please hurry!
I'm sending the nearest police car.
What's this dude's problem?
Seriously? We're gonna have to get in front of him.
Okay.
You got a guy trapped inside, inside the compactor.
That's impossible.
He dialed 911 from inside.
No, I mean that's not possible.
We haven't picked any garbage up yet.
Wait, what?
You got the wrong truck, man. She's empty.
It's the wrong truck.
Um, thank you. Carry on. Y-You're doing a great job.
Dispatch, this is T-118. We are at Chandler and Allott.
We have the wrong garbage truck.
Do you have a location for the garbage truck?
ATHENA: This is 727-L-30.
I got eyes on your garbage truck.
Corner of Ventura and Stern. Search and Rescue on the way.
That's, like, two blocks away.
Let's go.
All right.
MAN: Help!
Turn it off!
Help!
Turn off the compactor now!
Turn off the compactor!
Help!
There's someone inside. !
The Dumpster. He was asleep.
How was I supposed to know he was sleeping in one of the Dumpsters?
You're not in any trouble.
Yeah.
What kind of pressure does it operate under?
I don't know. 2,000 PSI That would crush a car.
GARBAGEMAN: Damn. Look at her go.
Hello Can you hear us?
Ooh, this stinks.
People call us heroes?
BUCK: Oh, Hen, hold up.
It's gonna take forever by hand.
Hey, Chim, can you grab shovels?
Come on, what are you, scared to get your hands dirty, Buck?
Come on, let's go!
I don't know.
But if I were you, I'd stay out of her way.
CHIMNEY: I'm coming in.
You got that.
GARBAGEMAN: Wait, so, he was, uh, he was sleeping in a Dumpster, They give them to the homeless.
It's part of the Lifeline program.
Keeps them connected to family, if they have any.
I got him. I see a foot!
I got it.
I got a pulse.
Stay still, sir. Do not move your neck.
Chim, get me a neck brace and a board in here.
We got to get him out of here.
I don't understand.
How'd he survive that kind of pressure?
Probably fell into this pocket here.
He got protected by the chair.
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Does it hurt when you breathe?
It hurts.
I can't feel my legs.
We're gonna get you out of there.
You're gonna be all right, okay?
Sam.
You're gonna be all right, Sam.
ABBY: So, Carla, it's your last chance to tell me if you're not up for working extra hours.
When have you ever known me not to speak my mind?
Very true.
Well, I appreciate it.
Mm-hmm.
Buck and I are both working the graveyard shift, and then he has a little breakfast date planned for us.
Ooh.
And considering our last proper date was scheduled when you and I were in the E. R. with her.
Uh-huh.
Well, have fun, all right. I could use the overtime.
Okay, good. Good.
Hope this date is him having you rub baby oil on his biceps.
Okay, Mom.
I got to go to work.
Stay.
Mom.
Stay, please.
I know. I wish I could.
Stay. Stay.
Please.
It's okay. I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Are you okay?
Come on. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Do you...do you need some ice?
I'm good. I mean...she's getting worse.
Maybe it...this could be another episode.
Oh, God.
It's okay.
I should stay. I'm not...
No. No.
No, no, no. Get out of here.
No, I mean, this is...
Go to work. Go to your date. Go be young while you still are.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. Okay.
Oh, my God.
I didn't ask you to lunch just so I can buy you a hot dog you won't eat.
Talk to me.
Is this about Karen? Did you tell her?
I didn't have to.
She already knew.
And she presented me with papers.
Custody.
My ex is suing us for custody.
On what grounds?
'Cause she's the birth mother.
And that she gave up the baby under duress.
Does she have a chance?
Well, I read about a case in Michigan where they took a five-year-old little boy away from the only family he ever knew and gave him to his birth father.
I mean, her chances are slim, but they're not zero.
And now she's saying that...that Denny's living in an unstable home because...because I stepped out on my wife.
With the same damn woman who's suing you for custody?
All I know is that I just feel like...covering myself in all that garbage we just dug through and letting the compactor just squish me into nothing.
You gonna get through this.
And I'm here to help.
I mean, if you need the number of a good lawyer...
Divorce or custody?
Between my wife and my ex, I don't know who I'm-a face in court first.
You know, my recommendation for you will be make divorce the last option.
It's hard work, especially if you have kids.
You and Michael -- y'all gonna get a divorce?
It's time.
I mean, I'm not sad about...
I am, but I know it's the right thing.
Mm-hmm.
And I feel excited about the future, you know, about not feeling so confused all the time.
You finding anyone new?
Dang, girl, already?
What Get out of here with that.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
I'm still trapped in my past.
You just got free. You gonna tell me about this.
The other night, I met a guy at a bar.
Wow.
Athena Grant let a stranger pick her up and take her home?
Oh, I did a background check. Yeah, no.
My plan wasn't to go home with him, but he was just...
Needed to feel like a woman.
Mm.
I left there thinking that, you know...that's a one-hit wonder.
Guess I made an impression.
Tomorrow right after my shift.
Oh!
We're late. Again.
Dr. Franks doesn't care.
Because Dr. Franks gets to charge us for the whole session, no matter how much of it we miss.
Maybe it's not worth it, okay?
I don't think Dr. Franks is really doing any good.
Because you are not trying.
To grow up. To be an adult.
You're 18, not eight. You don't have a job.
You are not in school.
You flunked out after one semester -- which, honestly, I did not even realize was possible -- because you did not try. You never try.
So I haven't figured out yet what I want to do with my life.
Okay, does that...
Do you think that I really want to spend 80 hours a week hawking luxury lofts and million No, I really don't.
Ow!
Mom?
M Mom! Mom, are you okay?!
911, what's your emergency?
I'm at the Wilshire Bedford Medical Tower, the elevator just crashed.
Crashed?
The rope just snapped, okay! I'm fine, but I think my mom hit her head.
Please send help!
All the cars are locked down.
Car three was headed up to 14, and somewhere around eight, damn thing just started dropping like a rock.
Dispatch says two: a mother and her teenage son. The mother's hurt.
BOBBY: Where's the car now?
DAVIS: Halfway below basement level.
That's the other problem.
Since this morning.
Third one this month. Pipes in this place are ancient.
Every time the construction guys go near them, they burst.
And did you replace the elevator cables afterwards?
The water corrodes them.
We were gonna do that after we took care of the flooding issue.
We're gonna have to go in from above.
Buck and I should just go down with the basket.
I'll get the winch.
I'll lock and tag out the power of the cars.
This way.
TODD: Mom, the water's getting higher.
MARJORIE: Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Come on.
No, you're doing fine.
No, I mean, we're only here because of me.
Dad left...because of me.
Oh, no.
You're right, okay? I'm a screwup.
I-I am, and I'm sorry.
No.
I'm sorry.
Listen to me. That is not why your father left.
Your father left...because he got bored.
Of me and our life and anything resembling responsibility.
Is that why you're so mad at me?
Because I'm like him?
You're nothing like him.
You take after me.
Okay.
And that's why I push you so hard.
Listen to me.
Okay.
Because I know...you can be so much more.
CHIMNEY: Pressure line's ready, Cap.
All right, let's go.
All right, that's good.
Honey. Honey. Honey.
Uh-huh. Wait. Right here.
Hello!
TODD: Thank goodness.
BUCK: Be right there, guys.
Watch yourselves.
MARJORIE: Thank you.
Rope coming in.
Oh, my...Hi.
Hey, guys.
My son is, is right behind me, yes?
Yes.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Okay.
Don't even worry about it, okay? I'll be right there.
HEN: Okay, Bobby.
All right, we're gonna bring her up. Go ahead, Chim.
BOBBY: Come right through here.
Just come right through here.
All right, that's one.
Thank you.
You're next. Okay, let's do this.
All right.
BUCK: Uh, hey, uh, Bobby, um, need another harness.
Coming down.
Oh.
Hey, the-the weight of the water is pulling us down.
BOBBY: All right, grab the kid, get the hell out of there.
Yeah, but we both won't fit.
I need another harness.
We can only do one at a time, Cap.
I don't suppose you do a lot of pull What?
That's what I thought. Okay.
Pull it up.
All right, let's freewheel it. Come on.
Okay, ready?
We got you, we got you.
All right...all right.
Buck! Buck!
Buck!
Mom?
Hey. Hey.
Is she gonna be all right?
They'll check her out more at the hospital.
It just seems like a mild concussion.
You'll just have to keep an eye on her for the next few days.
We could have died like that.
Trapped together, full of anger and resentment.
I don't want that.
But we didn't.
They got us out. We're free, Mom.
No.
I don't mean today.
I mean 20, 30 years together, stuck with each other until I draw my last breath.
You need to move out.
But I don't have a job, Ma. I...
You will find one.
You proved today that you are not a helpless idiot.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You keep on that uniform.
Hmm?
It's a hot day in July.
One of those hundred-degree So Cal days.
You spot me on La Brea.
I'm driving 90 in a 45.
You hit the siren, pull me over, and walk over to my window, where you lower yourself down.
You make eye contact.
It is so hot that you unbutton your shirt.
Are you serious?
Have you been smoking something?
Athena, seeing a woman as beautiful as you in a police uniform, it's...mmm.
I'm a strong man.
I run an entire department.
50 people all answering to me.
I'm in control.
So what could be more sexy to me...than a woman strong enough to take that control away from me?
Mmm.
Mm, well, I've never done anything like that before.
At least not in the bedroom.
Mm, mm, mm.
Sir.
Ooh.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to place you under arrest.
On what charges?
Being so damn fine.
Might want to restrain me, Sergeant.
I've been a bad, bad boy.
Ooh.
Don't you want to read me my rights?
Ooh, you have the right to be as loud as you like.
Mmm...
You just handcuffed both of us to the bed.
I thought you were into it.
I was. But the key to the cuffs is in my belt, on the floor!
AARON: Oh.
Damn.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
Maybe you can go over...
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Just wait a minute.
Okay.
Oh. No.
No, no. It's...won't move.
Hold up, wait.
Oh! Okay, wait, wait.
Okay. I have a friend.
He's two houses down. I'll-I'll just give him a call.
Oh, no. No, no, no. Uh-uh. No, you won't.
Nobody's coming through that door that I don't know.
So how we supposed to get free?
Abby.
Yeah.
Take line two.
They're asking for you.
They're asking for me? Through the system?
Yes. Requested you specifically.
More demanded.
911. This is Abby Clark. What's your emergency?
ATHENA: Hi. Abby, it's Athena. You recognize my voice?
Oh. Yeah, Athena. H Uh, no. Uh, just "Athena." Okay. Uh, Athena, wh Are you on duty?
Uh, this is a personal call.
I, um, seem to have gotten myself in a-a bit of a jam.
I need you to call Henrietta and have her call me back at this number.
Okay. Um, I can do...I don't...
I don't have...do you have her number?
It's in my phone, which I don't have access to at the moment.
It's okay. I can ask Buck for it.
Oh. Oh, fine.
Don't-don't tell him why you need it.
Okay, I won't. Um...
Are you okay, S...A
I'm in no danger of anything, except being embarrassed.
Okay.
'Thena?
ATHENA: Hen!
Hen!
Is that you?
What the...the hell?
Hen, um...
Are you done?
Athena, I thought...I don't know what the hell I thought.
What...You called 911 for this?
911 is the only damn number I have memorized.
Everything else is in my phone, which is over there with my belt and the key.
The key! You need the key?
You called me over here to walk across the room to get you the key AARON: She wouldn't let me call anyone saved in my phone.
And have one of your frat boy friends come over here and catch me like this?
You must be out your mind.
I was never in a frat.
All right, let me...let me...let me just unlock you, then.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Did I ask you to?
Just put it right there where I can get to it.
Seriously?
Mm-hmm. We good. You can go.
Mm!
M'kay. Well, damn!
Get it, girl.
Let me...
Well, I mean, let me just bring this over here, just in case y'all want to get kinky with the Taser.
Bye, Hen. Wait, let me just...I just want to get a selfie...
No, no. You really need to go!
* I'm in love with it, intoxicated...*
AUTOMATED VOICE: In 0.1 miles, keep right.
* Hi!
Hi.
What the heck is this?
It's our date.
Come on.
Oh, my gosh!
Hi. Hi.
These are for you.
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.
So beautiful.
Whoa!
Uh-huh.
No.
Oh, my...
Uh, no, but I've answered a few calls from ones that have crashed.
I'm just kidding. It's amazing.
And, uh, there is champagne and truffles on board.
You're surprising me.
Well, you're amazing.
I want to make sure I make you feel that way.
So, today, we fly.
Awesome. Awesome.
Oh, shoot.
Hold on one second. Sorry.
My mom.
Here, let me take these.
Oh, yes. Hold on. Thank you.
CARLA: Hey. I-I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
Okay. All right. She's having another episode.
Car...
Carla, Carla, maybe put her Here, okay, l-listen, listen.
Listen, listen.
There's Abby on the phone.
Mom.
It's Abby. Can you hear me?
She's right here.
PATRICIA: Why are you keeping me prisoner?
CARLA: I think she needs to see your face.
She needs to know you're here.
ABBY: All right.
Carla, I'll-I'll just be there as fast as I can, okay?
Okay.
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. I have to go.
Uh, hot air balloon.
I know, I know. It's my mom. Sh...
But it's a hot air balloon, you know? You can't just...reschedule that like a dinner reservation.
I know.
We had a really bad night, and she's just...just in a terrible place right now.
No, it's fine.
Thank you.
Thanks. I'm sorry.
Bye.
Bye.
You want to give me a lift to work?!
Thought you had the morning off.
Weren't you supposed to be up in a blimp or something?
Hot air balloon. And, uh, she bailed on me.
Uh, her mom wasn't doing well.
That's a bummer. Happens.
Yeah. I don't know.
Look, I'm-I'm super into her.
You know, she is...she's really smart.
And when she makes fun of me, it doesn't make me feel bad.
She has her own money. The sex is...insane.
Oh, here I thought she just had great hair.
She's the perfect woman.
But this is the second week in a row that my day off has been screwed up because she has to go and deal with her mom.
Well, people who are great tend to have full lives, with people who depend on them.
Yeah. And-and I really like her mom, you know?
I-I do. And I respect the way that Abby takes care of her.
I'm-I'm starting to think maybe...maybe this kind of relationship isn't for me.
You mean a real one?
I'm...I mean, I'm 26, right?
You know, I-I want to have fun.
You know? And I'm not saying that I should go and start jumping back into bed with every girl I meet.
I'm-I'm not trying to be that guy anymore.
But maybe I should find something that is a little less...adult.
Look, all those things that you feel when you're with Abby -- the closeness, intimacy and trust -- those things don't come for free.
Any woman of substance and experience has lived a life, and she's gonna come with some baggage.
I think your problem is you're hoping to pull her out of this trap she's in with her mom.
That's not gonna happen.
What she needs is for you to step inside with her, keep her company in there.
CECIL: What took you so long?
It takes as long as it takes, Cecil.
I'm doing the best I can.
Are-are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
How sure? Winslow. Winslow, how sure?
I'm very sure!
That's good. That's-that's very good.
Circled the block three times. I'm sure.
Did you...did you get the bread, Winslow?
Winslow?
I think my jacket's sn...
Don't...Wins...
Be careful. Don't...snagged on something.
Winslow!
911, what's your emergency?
Please, help! I think my brother's been crushed.
Please send help!
Where are you calling from, sir?
I think he set off one of the booby traps.
Sorry, did you say booby traps?
Oh god, please. Just hurry!
Buck, get the saw.
Yes, Cap.
Dispatch said something about the house being booby-trapped.
We have to take the door.
Here you go, Cap.
Oh, easy, Cap. Easy.
CHIMNEY: What on earth?
HEN: We're never getting past that.
Not unless we have a bulldozer in the truck.
1968.
CHIMNEY: Here, hand it to me. Hand it to me.
What is that, a tunnel?
BETSY: They're total kooks.
Hoarders on steroids.
One I actually never seen. Never leaves the house.
The other, you know, every once in a while, you'll see him skulking around the neighborhood, goes out for groceries or newspapers.
And he circles the block three times before disappearing into the house.
It's like he's, uh, afraid someone's following him.
Trust me, no one's following him.
Same thing round back. Window's our best choice.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Heads up!
Damn, this is insane! Hey, Cap, you got to see this!
BOBBY: Buck! Buck!
Buck!
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
I told you. Kooks!
ABBY: Okay, Cecil, the fire captain is on the line.
He'd like to speak with you, okay?
CECIL: Yes.
Yes, o-okay. All right.
Captain Nash, his name is Cecil. He's older. He seems fragile.
He's probably gonna require some patience.
Of course.
Captain Nash, this is Cecil Farrier.
His brother is the one who's trapped.
Cecil, my name is Bobby. I'm outside your place, and I'm gonna help find your brother.
We need to pick a window, and you need to disarm the traps.
I can't.
I'm blind.
Okay, well, Cecil, what's the best way into the house?
Through the back tunnel, b-but I think that's totally collapsed.
So there's only one way in: the-the front tunnel.
BOBBY: How far back does this tunnel go?
Maybe...25 feet.
Stay to the right.
Just about halfway down, there's-there's a trap.
What happens if I trip it?
Uh, Winslow rigged a-a circular saw blade to-to fall through one of the cracks.
It would cut you right in two.
You disarm that, you disarm all the booby traps.
I can talk you through it.
Just please, please hurry.
What do you think, Buck?
I'm game, but...I don't think I'll fit.
I would.
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.
BUCK: What's that, Chim?
You make me sad, Buck.
Very sad.
Come on.
Okay, Cecil, I'm at the clock. What now?
CECIL: Is Copy. It's set to midnight.
So...move it to 11:11.
Copy.
Turn the clock to ease the tension on the trip wire.
Remember, that clock can set off other traps in the house.
You all right?
CHIMNEY: I'm good. I'm good.
Setting the clock to 11:11.
Nice and easy, now.
Slowly.
It's at 11:11!
All clear.
Cecil, can you hear me?
CECIL: Hello?
Oh, yeah, yes, yeah.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Where Coming. I'm coming.
Good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Now-now you have to help me find my brother.
Okay, I will, I will, I will, I will.
Yeah, help. Yeah.
I promise you I will.
Uh, just stay here for one second, okay?
I'm just gonna let some light in here so I can see.
Don't move.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
How long have you been living like this?
Not sure what you mean. Uh...Winslow and me -- we took the house after Mom and Dad died.
So, 1967, and...
Well, we had to protect the house, you know?
We-we wanted to make sure that nobody stole anything.
It's our house.
It's our house, and we had to protect it, and I can't do this by myself, so I need you to help me find him right now.
I need you to stop what you're doing and help me find him right now!
I will. I will.
I promise you I'm gonna find your brother for you, okay?
But I need you to stay right here so I can go get him, all right?
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
I'll be back.
I'll be back for you.
Okay. Find...find him.
Okay. Find him.
* Over here! He's here! Winslow!
You're gonna be all right, sir. We got you.
Just try to keep still. Grab my bag!
CHIMNEY: Cecil, he's okay.
We're gonna take care of you now. Please stay still.
Okay.
All right.
Ready? One, two, three!
Flip!
Ow!
HEN: All right, I see some blood down here.
Let me check it out, you guys.
All right, just keep...
Ooh.
Okay.
All right, hold on. We got a compound fractured tibia, penetrated to the skin.
A slight discoloration below the break.
BOBBY: Okay, check the dorsalis pedis pulse.
All right, sir.
I'm not finding anything.
He could lose his leg.
All right, we have to realign it, reestablish blood flow.
Okay, Buck, you and I stabilize.
Hen, Chim, do your thing.
Winslow, sorry. This is gonna hurt.
All right, hold him still. Hen, on three.
One, two, three!
All right. All right.
Keep your leg still! Keep your leg still!
Hard part's over. Now we got to get you to the hospital.
Okay, guys, strap him in.
No, no, no!
I-I can't leave...I can't leave my brother!
You're doing great. Stay still.
Hey. Yeah.
HEN: We're gonna get you out of here, sir.
You're gonna be fine, Winslow.
One, two, three, up!
All right.
HEN: Somebody grab my gear on the way out!
Winslow, it's okay. I'm here.
Easy, easy, easy.
BOBBY: Good job, guys. All right, keep going.
WINSLOW: No!
No! I can't leave. Please, I can't leave my brother behind.
I'm here. I'm here, Winslow.
Just...I'm here. Just let them take care of you.
I won't leave you, Cecil.
CECIL: You don't have to. You don't have to.
I'm...I'm-I'm coming with you.
* Sunny * Yesterday my life was filled with rain...*
Um, you got to help my brother now.
He's fine. He's fine.
All right, Winslow, come on.
* Smiled at me and really eased the pain...*
I'm here. I'm here.
* Oh, the dark days are gone * And the bright days are here * My Sunny one shines so sincere *
* Oh, Sunny one so true * I love you.
Is this cool? Like, I figured we try someplace completely not special, so-so if you had to cancel it, you wouldn't feel bad.
I'm sorry.
This is great. This is great.
Um, so how's your mom doing?
Same. I mean, worse.
You know, she's having a hard time walking, and eating is getting tougher.
But the worst part, you know, is, like, it's just the memory and the personality.
But this disease -- it doesn't just eat away at it like cancer does.
It almost just pushes it away.
Yeah, and, um...it sounds, it sounds...awful.
Sorry. I know, it sounds awful.
And I'm sure you don't want to hear it, 'cause I don't want to hear it 'cause I don't even want to be going through it.
I-I do want to hear it.
Well...
All right, you're-you're living it, and I want, I want you to talk to me.
I know, but it's just...I think there's a reason I've been doing this...alone, you know?
It's hard to drag somebody through it.
I don't want...you know.
I don't want that for you.
You're breaking up with me, right?
I think I just...I'm letting you off the hook.
See, I feel like anyone else, most people, if they were dealing with the stuff you have to deal with every single day, they would, they would see it as a cage.
But you don't.
You find a way to break free.
You find a way to be yourself.
You find...life.
And if the price I have to pay for being close to a woman like you is, yeah, whatever, a couple of canceled dates, then, you know what?
Then that is one heck of a good deal, and I am in.
I'm not going anywhere.
AARON: Now, for the star of the show.
Ah.
Duck rendang.
ATHENA: Wow.
That's a good-looking duck.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I bet your, uh, ex-husband wasn't a gourmet chef in his spare time.
Actually, Michael's a great cook.
Mm. There's great, and then there's duck rendang great.
Mm-hmm.
I want to run something by you.
I have a place in Big Sur.
I was thinking that we can get away for the weekend, hike, go on the beach.
No.
I can't go away with you.
I'm not even divorced yet.
It's a formality.
No. It's not.
I just got out of a 14-year marriage to a guy I thought I knew.
I'm figuring out how to be single at 50.
I'm not looking to jump into another relationship.
I want sex with no strings.
I don't need dinners or weekend getaways.
I got married because my biological clock was ticking.
I stayed married for the kids.
I'm getting divorced for myself.
I'm not ready for this.
And you...you are too good to be somebody's rebound guy.
Okay.
I assume you're not gonna stay the night, then?
Well...that depends...
Mm-hmm.
...on how good the duck is.
Uh, my lawyer says we're not supposed to talk.
Did you tell him that the only reason you're doing all of this is so that you and I will talk?
He is my son, too.
'Cause I carried him, I gave birth to him.
And you couldn't sign those papers to give him away fast enough, Eva. This isn't about Denny.
It's about you finding a way to get back with me.
Well, what's wrong with that?
I mean, we could give him a better family.
Me and you, together.
He ha a family.
Now, I know that Diesel is the reason that you stayed with her all these years.
Her name is Karen.
And I love her.
But she's got you trapped, living this sad, suburban life that is not you, but when I get custody...
You know that's never gonna happen.
So tell me...what do we have to do to make you stop this insanity?
What, you need money?
We don't got a lot, but, what, that's what it's gonna take?
I want you.
You had me, Eva.
You had me.
I loved you.
I would've done anything for you.
That wasn't enough. I wasn't enough.
See, you have this fantasy of us playing house, as if I hadn't already lived through that.
I know how it goes.
I know how it goes.
It's me trying over and over and over to build a life for us, and you tearing it down brick by brick by brick until I'm left alone, heartbroken, in a hole that I don't even know how to climb out of.
I survived you, Eva.
And I'm sure as hell not gonna let you put Denny through this.
Wait.
Just wait.
Okay, it won't be like that this time.
Oh, I can be different.
Being in that cage -- it changed me.
I love you.
I love you.
You are incapable of caring about anybody but yourself, which is why I will never let you near my son.
Count on that.
Count on it!
ABBY: A wolf will chew off its own leg just to escape.
("I of the Storm" by Of Monsters and Men playing) Which makes perfect sense.
* If I could face them * If I could make amends with all my shadows...*
If you're being held back, cornered, forced into a situation, you do whatever you can to change it, to break free, to survive.
* But I feel it burning * Like when the winter wind stops my breathing...*
But sometimes escape isn't our default.
* I fear you won't, I fear you don't...*
Sometimes we stay the course.
We cope, we navigate.
* And it echoes when I breathe, till all you see...*
Because traps don't look the same to everybody, especially not from inside one.
* Empty vessel, crooked teeth...*
Sometimes what the rest of the world sees as having us pinned actually ends up pushing us forward, giving us purpose, control, someone to talk to.
And once in a while, the very thing everyone thinks is holding us back is also what makes us feel at home.
* With all my thoughts...
Mom?
* I feel it biting, I feel it break my skin *
Mom.
* So uninviting * Are you really gonna need me when I'm gone? *
Mom?
* And they call me under
Mom?!
* And I'm shaking like a leaf
Mom?!
* And they call me underneath * To the storm.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
(sobbing)  Hey, I'm here.
I got you, I got you, I got you.
911, what's your emergency?
Help me! My husband's going mental.
I've locked myself in the loo.
<i>MAN: I will break down this door if I have to.</i>
911, what's your emergency?
There's something wrong with my wife. She's acting crazy.
Diane! Open the door!
Sir, you need to calm down.
Please hurry!
Calm down?
He's acting bonkers.
She broke a glass picture frame over my head!
It's like she's a completely different person!
It's like he's a completely different person!
DIANE (british accent): Bloody hell, go away!
Sir, hands in the air.
Just open the door, honey.
Sir, hands in the air.
Oh, good...What? What the hell are you doing?
Look, I didn't do anything.
Okay? No. No, no, no, no, no. No.
All right, we'll sort this out later.
Okay. Look...here. Take him out of here.
There's something happening to my wife.
OFFICER: All right. Calm down.
We'll get this all sorted out.
Miss, LAPD here.
Are you all right? Everything's okay.
Your husband's out of the house. I'm not gonna let him hurt you.
It's okay. Everything's fine.
I don't know what set him off.
He's acting absolutely bonkers.
I mean, I mean, we get into an argy-bargy every fortnight or so. He'll go to spare,  do his nut, but he never goes mad like this.
Sit down.
(hiccups) Oh.
(hiccups) Wow, those are some world-class hiccups.
I'm sorry, it's so embarrassing.
(hiccups) I woke up half nine with a migraine, had a spot of tea, and they just started.
An hour later and I can't get (hiccups) rid of them.
Okay, can you tell me what happened?
<i>OFFICER: Domestic call.</i> <i>Guy got into it with his wife.</i> <i>Claims she threw a picture frame</i> <i>at his head.
I'm not claiming anything.</i> That's what happened. Look, forget about me.
There's something going on with my wife.
Sir, just relax, we have to take a look at your head.
Doesn't look too bad, does it, Chim?
No. Couple stitches. Easy-peasy.
Let me clean it up first.
David, the bobbies are asking if I want to press charges.
The "bobbies"?
Baby, there is something wrong with you.
Ma'am, you don't have to decide right now.
We can take him...
No, Officer, you don't understand.
I understand just fine.
No, you don't.
She's not British.
Yeah, that's not her voice.
She was born in Brooklyn. The bobbies?
The closest she's ever been to England <i>is binge-watching episodes of Downton Abbey.</i> I don't know what he's talking about.
David, you're frightening me.
Look, we woke up this morning, and she just starts speaking like that.
It's bloody this, bloody that. A spot of tea.
All this weird British slang that I've never heard before.
(hiccups)  At first, I thought she was joking, but then it didn't stop, and I don't know what the hell's going on.
So, I try to take her to the hospital.
She freaked out, so I called 911.
Did she hit her head? Was she in an accident recently?
No, not that I know of.
Hey.
She told me she woke up this morning with a migraine.
That and violent hiccups.
That coupled with obvious chest pains, I-I think she's having a stroke.
A stroke? Wouldn't she have slurred speech or paralysis or something?
A man would, but a woman learns that symptoms can be different.
Big-ass hiccups is one of them.
She's right. Stick your tongue out for me.
When's your birthday?
Right, it's, um...April.
Okay. Take my hand, come with me.
Chim, get the TPA injection ready.
Take it easy, okay?
Just sit down right here.
There's a clot that's preventing oxygen to get to her brain, so her synapses are misfiring.
ATHENA: That could cause her to speak with a British accent?
The brain is still the great unknown.
Some people wake up from a coma and can suddenly speak Mandarin.
CHIMNEY: Please put your arm right here.
All right, let's get her to the hospital.
Come on.
Are we taking the tube?
Hey, hey, hey, is she gonna be all right?
CHIMNEY: The shot should keep her safe until we get her to the hospital.
Okay. Thank you.
Don't thank us. Thank her.
Thank you.
(quietly): Hey, hey.
Hmm?
I found another Patricia box.
Oh...
(laughs)  Wow, she kept it all.
Yeah.
It seems like Abby doesn't want to keep any of it.
Mm.
No way. Look at this.
This is her, right?
That's Abby.
<i>BUCK: Abigail Clark.</i> You never told me you made the Olympic team.
What is this?
(chuckles) MATTHEW: 200-meter butterfly.
She was a rock star.
That was a long time ago.
BUCK: You got to have this out.
You should be proud. You were an Olympian.
I'm gonna grab a frame for it.
You got some empty ones in the closet.
I'm...that's going up, that's for sure.
You didn't tell me he moved in.
He didn't move in.
I...(scoffs) Abby, he knows what's in your bedroom closet.
And he's taken over the medicine cabinet.
Okay, stay out of my medicine cabinet.
He did not move in, he's just been here a lot because he's been helping me deal with everything.
MATTHEW: Okay...(sighs) (clears throat) (camera clicking) (knock on door)  One sec.
I'll be right out.
(clears throat) (door opens) (typing) CHIMNEY: Why you so mopey? Pasta?
HEN: Nah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that all about?
What?
You closed your laptop as soon as we walked in here, like you were hiding something.
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.
BOBBY: I just took a sip of tea.
Chim!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
CHIMNEY: RomancingTheUniform. com?
That's my dating site. That's where I met Tatiana.
Holy crap, are you actually putting yourself back out on the scene?
My sponsor said maybe it's time.
I spend too much time in my work, in my head, and that dating, having a girlfriend would help get me out in the world.
I think it's great, you taking the leap.
It's brave. While at the moment, I think that dating or sleeping with someone is not worth the trouble, but I'm happy for you.
Look, this just isn't me.
I-I feel like a probie stretching his first job.
You're not a rookie, you're just rusty.
Last time I had a date, I was in my 20s.
Yeah, this is terrible.
And this picture looks like you're trying to sell real estate from a bus stop bench. And you know what?
I will not be buying. All right?
You cannot describe yourself as, "I am a lifesaver",  "not a heartbreaker."  Why not?
That's solid, sweet.
No, it is cheese.
Sweet, sweet cheese.
(laughter)  You like flan?
Good flan is the bomb.
(LAUGHING): Oh, he...
You don't?
You have an AOL e-mail account still?
It is literally like you were frozen in ember in 1995.
It's "amber," not "ember," you idiot.
Who cares?
You can never show this to a girl.
Why not?
Okay, this profile is a joke profile for a guy no one ever wants to go out with.
You know what, maybe you are not the right person he should be taking dating advice from, Buckaroo.
And why is that? Because last time I checked, I'm in a stable, monogamous relationship with an amazing woman.
He...I'm the healthiest dater at this whole table.
Oh, my God, he's right.
(laughter) The world is turned upside down.
(laughter) Yeah, okay, laugh, huh?
I am proof that real change is possible.
ALYSSA: What the hell, Evan Buckley?
BOBBY: Can we help you?
You lead me on for six weeks?
The sexiest, deepest, most romantic, most intimate relationship I've ever had with a man...I told you everything.
You told me everything. And I am not an easy nut to crack.
Is this your sick game?
Make a girl reveal every fear and secret and turn-on, and then you just disappear?
Is ghosting girls your thing?
I'm sorry, are you sure you have the right Evan Buckley?
You mean the Evan Buckley who's a firefighter?
Who works here and was on the news, and climbed a roller coaster and looks exactly like you?
Listen, yeah, sure, that-that is definitely me.
But the-the me that I am, and the him that you're describing, that is not the same person.
BOBBY: Whoa! Hey, whoa.
You see that?
No, no, I swear, I have never seen her before.
If you say so.
No, I do say so.
Okay, I swear, I-I don't know who that was.
I have...I have found real intimacy.
Right? You know this. Come on.
I haven't even flirted  with anyone else.
Sure, you haven't.
Yep, you're proof that real change is possible.
(alarm ringing) (indistinct dispatcher chatter) Guys...
(door closes)  Don't forget your bathing suits.
Dad says there's a pool.
Yeah, and your moisturizer and gel.
I'm too old to have my dad twist my hair.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait a minute. Th-That's my specialty.
Well, humor the old man.
(chuckles) I hope you don't mind, I let myself in.
Well, as long as your children live here, those locks aren't gonna change.
Hey. Now, you know I'm gonna miss you.
(laughs) Aw.
Okay, so...do we all need to talk about all of this?
You know, first weekend away with Dad since we split up.
I feel like this is one of those things where talking about it will only make it harder.
Yeah, and it's not our first time going away with Dad alone.
Yeah, but this is different.
Do you guys need to talk about all this?
No, it's all right. We get it.
All right. Mm-hmm.
Right? All right. Have fun.
Okay, bye.
Okay, all right.
All right, let's make it happen.
(both chuckle) Are you okay?
Hmm. (chuckles)  You know, if you're worried about Glenn, I mean, you have my word  he will not be around at all.
No. I trust you.
It's just...it's gonna be weird sleeping here with my babies out under some other roof.
Oh.
Being without you is hard enough.
Being without them?
Mm.
It just makes me see why people stay together  for the sake of the kids.
Yeah.
I just never pictured myself being a person who doesn't wake up every day in the same house with her children.
But this is us now.
We're on our way to being better people, more authentic people.
And that journey, well, it just isn't free.
Hmm.
Hey.
(door closes) CHIMNEY: Hen, Karen'll come around.
I mean, she has to know that it wasn't you that night.
You were possessed. You were someone else.
It was a full moon.
Was it? I don't know, Chim.
We are what we do, right?
How can I claim to be a family woman, a faithful woman, when I did that?
What if I've just been pretending with Karen?
What, so you don't want to get back together with her?
Of course I do. I love her.
I'm just dealing with an existential crisis.
Like, what if that's not who I am?
Can we be together now that I've exposed this truth about myself?
What if I, what if I'm a completely different person?
You're still a lesbian, right?
Well, looks like we came to the right place to get you some answers.
The time of death: 3:30 p. m.
Guess we're a little late.
<i>LYLE: No, no, no, don't call it.</i> <i>Hey, hey, I'm not dead.</i> <i>Come on, Lyle! Wake up!</i> Yours is in there. The stiff is ours.
<i>LYLE: No, no, no, no, no, don't leave.</i> <i>No, please.</i> <i>Help me!</i> I don't know what happened.
He just keeled over.
Fell like a stone.
I had just finished reading his palm.
This man's lifeline was really long.
Well, it's not an exact science, now, is it?
Left hand, please.
Relax and breathe. Deep breaths.
Look, Hen, I'm just saying, making one crazy mistake, you know, doesn't make you a completely different human being.
It just makes you human.
Except it wasn't a mistake. It was a choice, Chim.
And I got to ask myself, why?
Why would I make that choice? Risk everything?
Would you like a quick reading from me?
I'd like for you to keep breathing into this bag and mind your own business.
I knew she was gonna say that.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you so much, Carla.
You're welcome.
You going on a trip?
Uh...
No...Oh, no, that's my mom's.
I have to send it back so that no one steals her identity.
She never traveled.
Well, not Mom.
(chuckles) She got married so young.
She always talked about traveling.
"I'm going to go to Ireland.
"I'm going to eat my way across Europe." 
(laughs) She didn't do it, though.
She only...I think she only went to...
Yeah, Mexico...Cabo.
It was for, uh, Matt and Beth's renewal of their vows.
CARLA: Hmm.
You good?
I mean, you had me a little worried when you said you were going back to work.
But you seem good.
I do?
Yeah.
I guess I'm good.
Oh.
I wanted you to have that.
They were my mom's and they're not really valuable or anything, but they meant a lot to her and you meant a lot to her.
You meant a lot to both of us.
I love them. (chuckles) But, um, you sure you want to give these to me?
Oh, I have so many things...to remind me of my mom.
And I want you to have something to remind you of her.
As if I could ever forget Patricia.
(both laugh) Or you.
Thank you for the earrings and, uh, making me feel like part of the family.
Yeah. (chuckles) Oh.
<i>LYLE: Somebody, anybody, for the love of God,</i> <i>I'm not dead.</i>
<i>WOMAN (OVER P. A.): Forensic Pathology, 2211.</i>
<i>LYLE: Wake up, Lyle, move something.</i> <i>Anything. Get 'em to notice, come on.</i> <i>This isn't happening.</i> <i>Damn it, Lyle, wake up.</i> <i>I don't want to die!</i>
(cries out) (gasps) (blade cutting) (line rings) DISPATCHER: 911. What's your emergency?
Um...
Oh, hey, down here.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.
HEN: You...I...you're...
At-at the psychic's house.
You-you-you were...
I was dead, right?
Oh, you might want to, um...
I had to improvise.
Oh.
Wound's pretty deep but no severed artery.
Pulse is good.
I'm gonna hit him with some amyl nitrite.
Okay.
Ow!
Okay. Relax, relax.
Relax. Just relax for me.
Ow!
We got you. We got you.
We got you.
(groaning) CHIMNEY: And how about you? Are you okay?
I'm just gonna check your vitals.
You seem surprisingly calm for a dead guy.
I have narcolepsy with cataplexy.
No way. He wasn't dead.
He-he fell into a paralytic sleep.
And your vitals were imperceptible.
No way.
You must've, like, freaked out when you woke up on this table.
Yeah, well, I mean, I did  the first time it happened.
First time?
This has happened more than once?
Yeah. I-I've been pronounced dead by accident three times.
What? That's insane.
You think maybe you want to wear a bracelet so you can tell people you have this disorder?
Yeah, maybe a tattoo across your chest that says, "Do not use bone saw, I am not dead!" with, like, ten exclamation points.
No, I don't want people to know.
I'm sure he would have appreciated it.
Damn straight!
No, I'm serious.
Each time that I die I wake up a completely different person.
Each time I am reminded of just how precious life is.
It's a gift.
And, you know, I'm terrified of the day that I don't wake up in time and they actually bury me alive.
But, uh, until then...death becomes me.
Hey.
God, Hen...what are you doing here?
I know you go grocery shopping on Fridays.
I didn't want to make a scene at your parents' house in front of Denny.
S-So you thought confronting me in the Bristol Farms parking lot was better?
I would've preferred a phone call, but you haven't returned mine.
(sighs) Look, I...
I'm not blowing you off.
(keyless entry beeps) I'm just...busy with everything.
Can I please get five minutes?
Fine.
I'm listening.
Karen, I love you.
(scoffs) I know.
I know that doesn't mean a whole lot right now, but it's all I've got.
You...you and Denny, you're everything to me.
Hen, I can't. I can't.
I messed up.
(Karen groans) I'm a mess.
But you get me, Karen.
Not a lot of people do.
Please.
Please come home.
You...you hurt me, Hen.
I wish, I wish, I wish the person that went over to Eva's that night wasn't me, 'cause you know that's not who I am.
Hen, I can't. I-I can't do this.
I can't do this right now.
I have to...I have to make dinner and I-I have to get Denny ready for bed.
Karen, I love you.
(sighs) I-I know you know that.
I do.
(door closes, engine starts) So, what did your brother...you know, did he like me?
(both laugh)  I think he did.
Yeah?
Although he was really funny when he thought you had moved in with me.
I guess I kind of did, right?
Is that okay, my-my stuff being at your place?
Yeah.
I mean, I hadn't really thought about it like that.
You've been so amazing through this.
I got your back, you know that.
Really.
DAPHNE: Hello, Evan.
Um, hi.
You seriously don't recognize me.
I look exactly like my profile pic.
Daphne B. The girl that you've been DMing for the past three months.
Well, until you fell off the face of the earth.
You think it's cool to just blow people off?
No, no, no, hold on, hold on.
This cannot be happening again.
What do you mean, "again"?
You said that I had the prettiest eyes you'd ever seen.
They're real, unlike your profile status.
You said you were single.
Did you say that recently?
No, no, Abby, Abby, this is, this is just a big misunderstanding.
No, no, no, there's no misunderstanding.
I've been communicating with this jerkwad for three months, and now he doesn't know who I am.
You're the second girl in two days to say that I've ghosted them.
Whoa. Hey, come on.
Oh, my God.
I just did you a huge favor, lady.
You're welcome.
What...?
No, I-I swear. I don't know who that was.
I thought you weren't doing that anymore.
Hey, I'm not. You know, hey, you know me, right? Come on.
I don't know. I don't even know who I am right now.
But I definitely don't feel like I know who you are right now.
Abby.
Abby, come on.
YOLO.
I learned that term from my boy.
I know the kids coined it only just to justify doing something irresponsible, but you only have one 50th birthday.
No arguments here.
Half a century of living, most of it pushing insurance?
I know I deserve this.
(sighs) My wife is completely against it.
Ah, they usually are.
Meg would lose her mind  if she knew I was here even browsing.
Well, she'll forget she ever felt that way after you take her for a spin on one of these bad boys.
(sighs) She's usually right about stuff.
Knowing me...And I even told her this...I'd probably ride the thing a few times and then just lose interest.
But I don't know.
(laughs) (exhales) I told my boy I was doing this.
I promised him he'd see his old man come home looking like some kind of badass Easy Rider.
(laughs) (Kenny sighs) These bikes, you got any of these in red?

(tires screeching) (horn honking) (siren wailing) ATHENA: Where's the captain?
Not much we can do for him.
Speed of impact tore him clean in two.
He's lost a lot of blood.
I don't know how he's made it this long.
Well, the helmet probably kept him from dying on impact.
His circulatory system is keeping his heart beating, killing him at the same time, pumping all his blood out into the street.
He's got minutes.
KENNY: So stupid.
What time is it? I have to get home.
Meg's gonna lose it. She's gonna frickin' lose it.
Ethan's probably still outside.
Who's Ethan?
My son. He's on the porch, he's waiting for me, he's...outside, waiting for me. I told him to, so he could see me come home.
(thunder rumbles) How long before you guys have me out of here?
I'm so frickin' late.
Right now, your comfort is our priority, so I want you to just take a deep breath, try to stay still and relax.
Okay.
(phone buzzing) What's that? What's this, your phone?
You want your phone? Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
All right, we'll get your phone.
Okay. That's right...
Okay.
Oh, it's him.
Okay.
Hey. Hey, buddy.
Hey, pal.
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry, buddy.
I'm late, I know, I'm trying.
I'm try...yeah, I got it.
I got it, like we said.
96 Twin Cam engine, yeah.
1,560 CCs, cherry red...Oh, it's bad.
It's bad, just like the one we saw online.
Oh, it cooks, buddy.
I was hauling up Alameda like a badass.
Yeah, like a real Hells Angel.
Your old dad was like a new man, buddy, I'm telling you.
Uh, hey, and don't tell Mom: This thing is a chick magnet.
(laughs, coughs) Yeah, yeah.
I was on top of the world, pal, but let me tell you something: I would have felt just as good if I was on a ten-speed bike, 'cause I knew I was coming home to you.
(indistinct radio transmissions) (thunder rumbling) I love you, son.
(wheezes) ETHAN (over phone): Dad?
POLICE OFFICER: Ethan? Hi.
Is your mom home?
Why don't you put her on the phone.
(thunder crashing) ATHENA: Yeah.
(indistinct radio transmissions) Hey.
I'm sorry, that was unprofessional.
Oh, no one bats a thousand.
Not with the things we got to see every day.
When I'm on duty, this is who I need to be.
But the second I walk through my door at night, I turn into a completely different person.
Everybody here today looks like they're holding it together.
No doubt, they're going through a box of tissues tonight.
Anything I can do to help you with this one?
Yeah.
Will you go somewhere with me?
(fire engine siren) Hey yo, Rebar!
Come clean. This is you, right?
Putting girls up to this, you think you're funny?
You know what, Buck, I really wish it was me...
Okay, you wish, you wish.
Let's see...
but it's not.
I bet if you updated your relationship status on your Myspace page, it might clear up all of this confusion.
Hey, who even uses Myspace?
Oh, evidently, you do.
The hell. That's my Facebook picture.
Yet another disappointed young lady came into the firehouse today.
After I convinced her to stop shouting and throwing rocks, she showed me this.
Don't you get it?
Some weirdo saw your B-movie star looks in the news, and thought pretending to be you would be a good lure to catfish the women of L. A.
<i>So I'm a-I'm a Yankees fan who loves Star Wars?</i> <i>Uh, Star Wars prequels.</i>
(laughs)  Hey, it's not funny.
This is really messed up.
Yeah, it is, but come on, some dude doing the boring legwork, having hotties come to your door, I mean, what, is that really that awful?
Abby is freaking out. This cannot keep happening.
Who is he?
Okay, your imposter's not that bright.
He's already started exchanging e-mails with Brandy.
Who's Brandy?
The angry girl throwing the rocks.
Who's actually very smart and very cool, and who may or may not come to my place next week to watch the game with us, so please, don't come.
The point is, if you know what you're looking for, you can find the I. P. address in the header of the messages.
Just looks like a bunch of random numbers.
Yeah, Buck, random numbers that we can trace to his actual address.
(bell tolling) BOBBY: Thanks for coming here with me.
You ever go to church?
ATHENA: Every Sunday.
But I'm Baptist.
So we don't "go to church," we "do church." I'm here three or four times a week.
Keeps me out of trouble.
Uh, when I'm here alone, I can confess, pray, find the quiet to forgive and forget.
You think coming here and praying it away can work?
Works for me, most of the time.
Some things are tough to shake.
Hmm.
Oh, what a life we chose, huh?
No one on the outside can understand it.
(sighs heavily) Whenever I walk into a new place, the first thing I do is look around for something I can use as a splint.
I check to see if anyone's carrying a gun.
(both laugh) It's exhausting.
Yeah.
But it can be so damn fun.
(laughs softly) Could I ask you to pray with me?
I'd like that.
(dog barking)  BUCK: Hey!
Hey, catfish!
The jig is up.
Easy, guy, now keep a cool head.
This guy's a criminal.
Come on, freak, we got your number. Open up.
Maybe he's not home.
(bangs door) LAFD! Come to the door!
Must be a recluse, or a meth addict.
He's blacked out all the windows.
Oh, geez.
(flies buzzing) Oh, this is not gonna be pretty.
BUCK: How does this happen?
CHIMNEY: My guess? Heart attack.
It's kind of sad, you know?
The coroner said he's probably been lying there ten days, but no one notices?
CHIMNEY: The guy was a shut-in. The park manager says no one's seen him in, like, two years.
(gurgling)  BUCK: Well, it's tragic.
Let's not forget, this was an online predator.
Was he, though?
It's not like he was tricking women into hooking up.
He never went out.
If he could even get out.
Why are you defending him?
I'm just saying.
It's kind of a bummer, you know?
He hated himself so much he had to pretend to be someone else.
Don't get a lot of cases that bloat this much.
Body's probably double the size it was at time of death.
(gurgling)  Bloat set in after rigor mortis, filled him with methane and CO2, along with decomposition fluids, probably 'cause it's so hot in here, and he expired with a full stomach.
CORONER: I just don't know how to get him out of here.
We either got to knock down this wall, or...
(chuckles) roll this whole thing down to the morgue.
(crowd chatter) No. No.
Okay, look, this guy may not have lived with much dignity, but maybe, he can still die with some.
I mean, these people are already treating him like he's a circus sideshow.
Now, let's not make it any more of a spectacle.
I know a way we can get him out of here in a body bag.
That's a great speech, but that would take hours.
Why? You just drain all the gas and gunk and stuff.
We would have to use large bore needles and start the embalming process here.
Okay, so let's do that.
(sighs) He's dead. He doesn't care if people are gawking at him.
All right? He doesn't have any feelings to hurt anymore.
(sniffs) Listen...
You are not about to beat up a coroner, now are you, Buck?
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No! No!
(hissing, gurgling)  Ugh.
(groans) (scoffs) Nice work.
Yeah, I thought he was gonna pop.
I told you, draining him is going to take time.
What do you got, dinner reservations?
Let's get to work, okay?
CHIMNEY: Oh, God.
(hissing) (fly buzzing) Oh, my God.
Oh. (coughs)  Oh, oh.
(coughs) (fly buzzing)  Is that it? Is it done?
I think so.
Oh, God! Oh, my God. Oh, God.
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
(crowd chatter) All right, guys, clear a path. Come on.
Move back, please. Have a little respect.
Out of the way. Thank you.
Hey, thank you.
Yeah.
Nice job, Buck.
You did good.
(siren wailing) <i>BUCK: He was, like, a 350 pound mess,</i> been dead for a whole week.
These girls are getting blown off because the dude died.
That-that is all there is to it.
Okay?
I-I need you...I need you to know that, I need you...Abby, do you believe me?
Yeah, I believe you. I believe you.
(sighs): Okay.
I'm kind of relieved, 'cause I was feeling a little crazy there for a minute.
No, no. Hey, hey.
You're so not crazy.
You're so not crazy, okay?
It's a crazy story.
No...Yeah.
We got there and it was just...
Um...
Are you-you going somewhere?
Um...
I bought a plane ticket to go to Dublin.
Dublin, as in...Dublin, Ireland?
Yes, Dublin, Ireland.
I'm-I'm gonna go for a while, probably.
I don't know. I don't know how long.
A few months maybe.
W-Why?
For Mom.
She always wanted to go to Ireland. She never went.
So I need to go.
Also because...I'm kind of lost, Buck.
And I just lost my mom, but...I realize I also kind of lost myself a long time ago, and...I-I don't know, I think somewhere along the way, I just started caring so much for everybody else that I stopped caring for myself.
I mean, I used to be a person who would travel the world swimming in competitions.
And I...demanded so much from myself.
(voice breaking): And I feel like I need to find that again.
Because I feel like...I need to have something to give to my job and to the people who are counting on me and to the people that I care about.
I care about you so much.
You're amazing.
And these last few months, I think you've gotten me, at least halfway, to the person I want to be.
But I've got to do this so that I know I have something to give.
I'm excited for you.
Almost as much as I am, um...sad for me.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
Hey boss, I put you down for tacos.
Oh.
Not exactly game night attire.
I can't make it tonight.
I have a date.
No way.
You actually found a match with that time capsule post?
(chuckles)  So, uh, what's the plan?
<i>Little ER marathon followed by a little Montell Jordan</i> as you move into the bedroom?
All right. How do I look?
I'd lose the tie.
I got to wear a tie.
You look like a lawyer.
(Bobby groans) (Chimney chuckles) All right.
How's that? What?
Uh, wait.
That's better.
Not too much?
Not too much. Perfect.
I don't think I've ever seen you this nervous.
Well, it's kind of weird, once you get out of your own way, you start to see everything and everyone in a whole new light.
All right.
Have fun tonight, Cap.
Thanks, Chim.

(horns honking) HOST (over radio): It'll be 98 downtown, 113 in the Valley.
Three more fiesta combos!

HOST (over radio): And in the Inland Empire, a million degrees, give or take.
* Pressure...
(sighs) So keep cool, stay inside, unless you're one of the thousands without power right now, in which case, have you thought about moving?
Think I picked the wrong week to be trained.
Everything after this will be a cakewalk.
Get the cones set up.
* Where the only thing you feel are loaded guns *
* In your face (horn blares) * And you'll have to deal * Go, ass wipe!
* With pressure...
(engine revving, tires squealing) (people gasp) Seriously?

(laughs) Yeah, boom.
* One, two, three, four, pressure...* Looking good, Sam.
You make that shine, Tanika.
Outstanding haircut, Martin.
You are cheery.
Why shouldn't I be?
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause you've been like this for weeks, and it's starting to get on my nerves.
What's going on with you?
BUCK: I got another DXA scan, and guess who dropped another half percent.
What?
A DXA scan measures your body fat.
You can see your percentage in every part of your body.
Oh, yeah? They measure the fat in your head?
Ah, see, that would be funny, but we're about a week away from submissions being due for the Hot Days, Smoldering Nights: Men of the LAFD wall calendar, and I'm already at my goal weight, so it seems like my head is clearly working perfectly.
Do you really need to use that whole title?
You could just just say "that idiotic, reductive, "sexist calendar that insults the dignity of this organization and furthers the myth that all firefighters are male." Yeah, that's not any less words.
Hen, come on, it's for charity.
No. Bobby, you, too?
Well, why not?
They say a man is at his sexiest when he reaches 50.
Is that what they say? That's what they say?
CHIMNEY: Okay, you're both wrong.
All right? You see, I think sorority houses all across this great nation are ready for a new Asian sex symbol.
It's our time.
I think it's great.
You know? I like that you're both going up for it.
Oh, because you don't think that we have a chance.
Whoa, did I say that?
I mean, sure, let's be real.
They are only picking one candidate from each station.
Okay. That is a beautiful man.
Where's the lie?
And I like girls.
* What a man, what a man, what a man, what a mighty good man *
* You got to say it again now...* Who the hell is that?
It's Eddie Diaz. New recruit.
Graduated top of his class just this week.
Guys over at Station Six were dying to have him, but I convinced him to join us.
What do we need him for? Um...
(laughter) He served multiple tours in Afghanistan as an Army medic.
Guy's got a Silver Star.
It's not like he's wet behind the ears.
Come on, I'll introduce you to him.
He likes to be called Eight Pack.
Wow. Silver Star.
Better drop some more body fat there, butch.
HEN: Hi.
Hey.
BOBBY: Eddie, this is Hen. Hen, Eddie.
EDDIE: Nice to meet you.
I'm short-staffed today.
MAN (over phone): It's not my fault you can't run your business.
Look, I'm not saying that it's your fault.
All right? It's no one's fault.
Actually, it's your fault.
Okay, it is my fault.
You know what? I'm going on Yelp, But I did say...
and trashing your little tire shop.
...Wednesday or Thursday.
Please do not do that, sir.
We rely on Yelp for new business.
Whatever. I'm going on Yelp right now.
I understand that you are upset, and I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure I have it for you by the end of the day today Damn right you will.
Yes, sir.
My car better be ready.
You have a good day.
Dick.
(screams) EMPLOYEE: Hector! Aw, geez.
Somebody help us!
(siren wailing) So, Silver Star, huh?
Yeah.
You save a platoon or something?
No, no, nothing like that.
Uh, just a convoy.
(siren wailing, horn blaring) Eddie, uh, you heard about the hot firefighter calendar?
Sorry, the what?
It's for charity.
(laughs) So is your full name "Eduardo"?
No.
People ever call you "Diaz"?
Not if they want me to respond.
Something's got to give. We got...we got Cap, Hen, Chimney, Buck. We can't just call you "Eddie." Can't tell if he's being serious or not.
I like to always operate under the assumption that nothing he says is serious.
EMPLOYEE: The air nozzle is embedded in his ass cheek.
I shut it off, but I was afraid to move him.
Okay, Hector, can you hear me?
All right, hang in there, buddy.
All right, let's get him on his side.
Maintain pressure on the wound.
On three. One, two, three.
(screaming) Okay. Easy, easy.
It's a hundred pounds per square inch of air pumped through his entire body.
Breathing's shallow, heart's racing.
Air's filled his stomach, his chest, even behind his eyelids.
I'm more concerned about the space around his heart and lungs.
Okay, Eddie, start a nasal cannula.
Chimney, get him some morphine.
I'm on it.
It's like trying to inject a needle into stone.
EDDIE: The pressure's pushing everything out.
I can't even get air through the nostril.
Jugular venous distention, tachycardia, hypotension, diminished breath, we're looking at tension pneumothorax.
The air pressure is collapsing his organs.
We need to get in there and drain the fluid.
Buck, I need you to get a 14-gauge angiocath.
We need to start decompressing the pleural cavity.
All right, all right.
EDDIE: Want me to help?
I got it.
Hang in there, Hector.
I'd go lower.
What? Um, no. Second intercostal space.
Midclavicular line.
The chest wall is thinner at the fifth intercostal at the anterior axillary line.
There's a decreased chance of injuring any vital organs.
I've-I've treated guys with collapsed lungs in combat.
Do it.
Please.
Thank you.
Can you help me out with the shirt?
(air escaping) (gasps) BOBBY: That's it, Hector.
Breathe, nice and slow.
(panting) I mean, he swelled up.
How you doing, Hector?
(passing gas) Pressure's got to go somewhere.
It always does.
(continues passing gas) That was a good call, Eddie.
Thanks, Cap.
Nice job.
Yeah. Good call.
(siren wailing in distance) (shower running) (laughs softly) (screaming) Oh!
Maddie?
Damn it, Evan! Don't you knock?
Me? What-what are you even doing here?
Well, I was in town, and I wanted to see my little brother.
Well, you did.
Yeah.
(laughs) I should probably...
Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna...
Uh-huh. Yep. Yep. Yeah.
(sighs) BUCK: You think there is any way we can unsee that?
Oh, come on. I used to give you baths.
Yeah, when I was two.
Hey, how did you even get in here?
I told the building manager I was your sister.
And he just believed you.
Well, having boobs doesn't hurt.
How'd you know where I live?
Well, first, I went to the address the Christmas cards keep coming from, and the guy said you were here.
Wait. So you did get those Christmas cards?
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch much lately.
Three years, Maddie.
I haven't heard from you in three years.
Yeah, I know.
And it's not what I wanted.
Where is Doug?
Don't know, don't care.
You left him?
Finally.
Geez, Madds.
Come on, what took you so long?
What can I say? Mom was right.
Do they know?
No one knows.
And please don't tell them if they call.
I don't want anyone to know that I'm here.
Kind of sounds like you're hiding out.
No. More like laying low.
So what happened to you?
Because this place is nice, and clean, and you just cooked me food, actual food.
Is there a shallot in here?
Yeah, my, uh...my boss at work is like Guy Fieri.
He's been teaching me.
Uh, we have not made it past breakfast, though.
And this is, uh -- let me show you -- this is my girlfriend's place.
I'm, uh...I'm looking after it while she's out of town for a couple months, but, uh, she-she should be back soon.
This is her.
Aw.
How soon?
Uh, I'm not really sure.
Um, she was in Ireland, and now she's in Italy.
Said she's looking to have an Eat, Pray, Love experience.
Uh, to be honest, I don't really know what that means.
But you're still together?
Yeah. I mean, I mean, she said I should, you know, do whatever I wanted while she was away, but...
what I want is for her to come back.
I like the me that I am with her.
She's banging other guys.
I mean, that's the "love" part of her trip.
Whoa!
(laughs) Come on.
So you did come all the way from Pennsylvania to just crap on my life? That's a thing?
No, I'm sorry. I'm just being protective.
Okay.
(laughs) Anyway, uh, this is your first time here in L. A.
Gonna see the sights, hang around for a little bit?
I'm just passing through.
Listen, even if you are just here for a few days, uh, welcome to L. A.
It was getting pretty lonely around here.
ATHENA: That's right, Desna.
Show Uncle Daddy who the real daddy is.
(laughs) Ooh, I got to tweet that.
What?
Oh, oh.
Can we just watch the show?
That's your fourth tweet this episode.
Mm-hmm. Me and my girls, we always live-tweet Claws.
Mm-hmm. These are your friends, huh?
Ah, my Twitter Claws friends-friends.
Huh.
(chuckles) What?
I've just never known anybody who's so engaged in the viewing experience.
(chuckles) That's 'cause you've never been out to the movies in Crenshaw.
Well, let's do that then.
Do what?
Let's go out into the world as a couple.
(scoffs) Have you been outside lately?
We are out in that world all day.
I want to keep it on the other side of that door for a little while.
(sighs) Just enjoy this while we can, just the two of us. (moans) No pressure.
Ooh, Niecy Nash should be on Mount Rushmore.
Mm. (laughs) * I don't know what you've been told *
* But this here is not your home *
* If you want some trouble * You want some * Come on in and I'll take hold *
* These hands will break your bones *
* If you want some trouble, you...*
* When I see you * I see, I see * Blood in the water, ooh * Run deep * Ooh...
(panting) (camera clicks) You're in the wrong light, man.
Some of us don't need lighting to look good.
(grunts) Hey, Eddie, what'd you mean by "the wrong light"?
The light in this room is flat and blue.
Makes you look soft.
If you want to look lean and muscles to pop, you need warm side light. I'll show you.
These are the ones I sent in for the calendar.
CHIMNEY: Whoa.
BUCK: It's, uh, kind of cheating submitting pictures by a professional photographer.
(chuckles) The photographer's 12.
She's my niece.
She's a master at the iPhone filters.
CHIMNEY: Your niece did this?
EDDIE: Yeah.
You think she'd be willing to take my submission pics for me?
I'm told I photograph like a Asian Fabio.
Sure she would, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?
BUCK: Ah, you know, you really shouldn't get his hopes up like that.
(Buck grunts) No offense, Chim.
No offense taken, Evan.
BUCK: Yeah, come on.
What's your problem, man?
Okay. You.
You're my problem. Your comfort level.
You're-you're not supposed to just walk in here like you've been here for years.
It's meant-meant to be a getting-to-know-you period.
You're meant to respect your elders.
You're not his elder, Buck.
Look, I in no way meant to, uh, be too familiar or step on anybody's toes.
I know you're going through some personal stuff right now.
What personal stuff?
I know your girlfriend recently broke up with you and you're coming to terms with that.
No, I'm not. And she didn't break up with me.
Who told you that?
(grunting): 21.
I'm just saying I hear you're a good guy, and...
I'm sorry you're going through pain, but...
you don't need to take it out on me or-or be threatened by me. We're on the same team.
Why would I be threatened by you?
Exactly. There's no need to be.
We do the same thing.
I've just done it while people are shooting at me is all.
We're not broken up.
All right.
(laughs) Fire and Rescue. Hello.
CHARLIE (muffled): I'm back here. Help me.
BUCK: Some kind of militia nut?
CHARLIE (muffled): I'm back...
BOBBY: Can't tell where that voice is coming from.
CHARLIE (muffled): Back here.
Oh, thank God.
Hey.
What's your name, sir?
Charlie.
All right, tell us what happened, Charlie.
Damn grenade went off while I was taking it apart.
Why are you taking apart a grenade?
I was cleaning it. I'm a collector.
No kidding.
You pulled the pin?
Oh, it ain't that kind of grenade.
It's a 40-mike-mike.
A practice round for an M203 grenade launcher.
I picked it up at a flea market in Brea, part of my 'Nam collection.
My screwdriver must have touched the propelling charge. I...
All right, I see metal. A lot of shrapnel.
Femoral artery has been nicked.
We got to get him transported now.
(siren wailing) I've got an adult male, age 65, with a large piece of shrapnel in his right thigh.
Femoral artery damage with profuse bleeding, ten minutes out.
Buck, I want you to travel with him to the hospital, keep him stable.
Copy that, Cap.
Hey. You got to learn how to play nice.
It's one team, Buck.
Hey, Nash, am I gonna be all right?
BOBBY: My boys have got you.
But you might want to consider switching to collecting baseball cards after this.
(siren wailing) I guess you've seen a lot of shrapnel wounds.
My share.
You ever seen a guy with a length of rebar stuck through his skull?
What are we measuring here, Buck?
(Charlie groans) Need to change those dressings. They're soaking through.
Hang in there, Charlie. Almost there.
I'm just saying, working the streets of L. A.
is not exactly stress free.
May not be the same kind of pressure you have in a war zone, but...
Oh, come on. Hold on.
I thought you said this was a practice round.
It is.
Uh, what-what-what's going on?
You see that cap?
Practice rounds have blue caps.
Gold caps are live.
Pull over!
JIM: Yup. There she is.
BOBBY: He's got a live round embedded in his thigh.
Uh, I thought this thing already went off.
The launch grenade has two components: gunpowder which makes it travel and an explosive charge that makes it go boom.
Okay, so why didn't this one go boom?
It's fitted with a proximity fuse.
It's a little smart sensor that tells the cap it's traveled a safe enough distance from the shooter to explode.
From his hand to his leg probably wasn't far enough.
Well, we can't bring him inside a hospital full of people, not with that still stuck inside him.
We called the military for help.
The military? Uh, can't you do it?
You're the bomb squad.
You can't diffuse a grenade. We need to find someone who knows how to pull that thing out of him without setting it off.
They're sending someone up from Pendleton.
Should be here within the hour.
He doesn't have an hour.
I can do it.
If he doesn't go to surgery soon, he'll die.
You've done this before?
Well, none of the guys I served with were dumb enough to shoot a live round in themselves, but I'm familiar with the ordnance.
I'm in.
You get that thing out of him, put it in here and get the hell away from it.
Let us deal with it.
Copy that.
See you inside.
All right, listen, Buck, you don't have to do this.
You think I'm gonna let the new guy have all the fun?
Besides, you wanted us to bond.
We might end up real close.
How you feeling there, Charlie?
Like a world-class idiot.
My wife, if she was still alive, she'd be here now saying, "I told you so." Well, maybe she'll be able to tell me in person in about a minute.
Well, that conversation's gonna have to wait.
Nobody's leaving this life tonight.
Start the drip.
What branch did you say you were in, Charlie?
I didn't. I always wanted to be a Marine.
I tried to enlist during 'Nam, but I was 4F, an enlarged heart.
So instead, I spent the last 40 years teaching seventh grade.
See there, Charlie?
Not all heroes serve on the battlefield.
That's very kind of you to say that.
You ready?
Yeah.
He's losing a lot of blood.
Keep pressure on it.
Not-not too much pressure.
There it is.
All right, so-so pull it out.
Come on.
I got to...be careful.
The sensor measures the distance traveled based on how many rotations the shell made after the launch.
The key is not to turn the shell while we pull it out.
Okay, yeah, so don't turn it.
(straining) You got this.
Gonna have to just...
a bit...
(groans) Get the box.
(relieved breaths) Let's get the robot in there.
You're badass under pressure, brother.
Me?
Hell yeah. You can have my back any day.
Yeah. Or, you know, you could...
you could have mine.
(laughs) Deal.
Nice work, fellas. I'm glad you both made it out of there.
The guy's a professional, Cap.
I was never really worried.
(sirens wailing) Cancel the robot.
You guys hungry?
So, what do you think?
I didn't want to overwhelm them with too many choices, so...
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Um, I think that it's, um, a little...
overwhelming.
You think it's ridiculous.
No, no, I mean...
(sighs) Chim, I kind of think the whole thing is ridiculous.
You don't think I have a shot.
The pictures are cool. I-I just...
I don't have these answers for you, Chim.
I'm not into beefcake calendars.
I know, I know.
Why is this so important to you?
Because growing up, I never saw any heroes who looked like me.
I can understand that.
I mean, not on TV, not in movies.
We're always the computer geek who hacks into the system for the white guy or the evil Tong drug lord.
Or the guy in the dry cleaners in a fabric softener commercial.
I mean, you know, when a kid thinks of a firefighter, do they think of me?
Do they think of you?
Yeah, but I'm not taking my shirt off for that calendar.
Yeah. You know what?
(sighs) Me, either.
Chim...
No, I don't know what I was thinking.
I can't compete with these guys.
Maybe ten years ago.
And that's only because they'd be 12.
(siren wailing) Hmm...
You just coming in from somewhere?
I was just going somewhere.
Look, we can stop by your house on the way so you can change.
We're gonna get some Korean barbecue.
Come on.
(laughs) No, no.
I just got Thai food.
Hey, I would like to take you out on a proper date.
Aw, that's sweet.
But you got to give me fair warning so I can get all done up for you.
I've tried that many times, but you always say you want to stay in instead.
And we've only been out together as a couple twice, on our first two dates.
Well, I like when it's just the two of us.
It's romantic.
It is.
Hey, who you hiding from?
It's been almost four months.
This just...it feels serious to me.
It feels real.
You know? What?
All right, what-what is it? What's going on?
I don't like being pressured.
Into going out for dinner? I'm...
This is not the same for you and me.
Like it's a black/white thing? I don't...
Are you crazy?
All right.
For you, this is a sign of you coming back to life after a tragic loss.
It's a redemption. For me, it's more complicated than that.
Okay, how is this not a redemption for you?
Because it's proof you can love again, you can trust again.
No one in my family has ever gotten divorced.
I am the first failure.
Hey, divorce is not a failure.
What do you know about it? Are you a woman?
Are you a black woman who can't keep her man?
The stigma of that.
Now you want me to go out on the town like a peacock, showing you off like nothing ever happened.
How's that gonna make me look?
Like a survivor.
Like a tramp.
Come on, Athena, that's crazy.
Nobody's gonna think that, and even if they do, who cares?
Well, you have the luxury of not caring.
I'm trying to do right by us.
How long are we supposed to sneak around like this?
Because I'm not gonna be satisfied with stolen kisses and take-out containers.
I don't like keeping us a secret.
It feels like lying.
You kept your secret about your past from everyone else for years.
Yeah, I did because I was ashamed of myself, and I still am.
Well, then, you of anyone should understand why I want to keep this quiet.
What are you ashamed of? Are you ashamed of me?
No! But yes.
Yeah?
Yes!
I'm ashamed! I'm ashamed of us.
I'm ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of being happy.
I told you, it's complicated. (scoffs) Well, I'm sorry it's so complicated.
Please leave.
SHAY: What up, fam!
We got this savage young man who is about to join the ranks of Shay's Army of Mayhem.
Jessie has agreed to let us cement his head inside this microwave oven!
So random, so awesome!
We have the concrete. (coughing) I need eye protection.
Copy.
(mixer whirring) (whooping) * A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it *
* We're going down, down in an earlier round *
* And, sugar, we're going down swinging...* Breathing tube. Don't bite it, bro.
No pressure, Jess.
Are you ready to join the ranks of the legendary?
(muffled): I don't know.
(laughing, whooping) Yeah!
(sirens wailing) Quick. They're in the back.
We put a tube in so he could breathe.
I think the cement smushed it.
What is it, a YouTube prank?
Don't judge.
Followers equals cash.
BOBBY: What's his name?
MITCH: Jessie.
Jessie, this is Captain Nash, LAFD. Can you hear me?
All right, he is totally cut off in this thing.
Let's get some screwdrivers, try to get this frame off.
(screwdriver whirring) What do you got, Hen?
Pulse 120, BP 150/110.
He's panicking.
All right, he's starting to choke.
HEN: Saliva's probably aspirated through the breathing tube.
Hold on one second.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Relax.
Calm down.
Okay, calm down.
Hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.
All right, step.
Easy.
All right, watch his neck.
His pulse is weak.
I have no respiration.
Is there a plastic bag in there or something?
Yeah, we put it on his head before we poured the concrete.
Please don't let him die.
He's my best friend since kindergarten.
I can't get in there.
BOBBY: Yeah, we had 30 minutes to get him out of there.
Now we got 30 seconds.
No response to sternal rub.
Pulse is fading. Still no respiration.
BOBBY: All right, Buck, once we get this frame off, you and I are gonna go hammer and chisel on that block.
All right.
Starting compressions.
All right, got it.
All right, Buck, I'm hammer, you're chisel. Let's go.
I can do this.
All right.
(grunts) Again.
(cement cracking) All right.
(coughing) HEN: Good job.
(exhales sharply) (coughing) All right...
Hold still, hold still.
Shay Reed here, fans.
And today's Shay-nanigan is maybe our most intense yet!
Are you filming this?
Yeah, bro. If we didn't film it, it didn't happen.
You were just crying like two minutes ago.
Yeah, two minutes ago, he was gonna die.
Now he's gonna live and be a legend.
Say hello, Shay's Army.
Hello, Shay's army.
Wait, what the...what the hell, man? What are you do...
Good-bye, Shay Army!
SHAY: Dude!
Ah-ha-ha, I found it.
I swear, we need to put GPS trackers on everything that boy owns.
Oh, you made waffles...for dinner?
What's wrong?
I-I don't know what the rules are here.
Like, if this is something we can discuss with each other.
Listen, whatever you have to say to me can't be as intense as what I said to you.
Right?
I've been seeing someone for the last few months.
Oh.
A firefighter.
Uh-huh.
No one else knows.
Not even Henrietta.
We've been keeping it on the down-low because we didn't know what it was or how long it was gonna last.
But now he wants to tell the world.
And you don't?
No.
Okay.
But he started to push, and I felt pressure, so I pushed back hard.
Ooh. Ouch.
What? I've been on the receiving end of your hard pushes.
And you care about him.
I can tell.
(laughs) So where's the harm in telling everybody?
I don't want to be embarrassed.
I mean, our divorce was enough of a failure.
I can't go through that again.
Oh, I get it. Okay.
You don't want to invest 'cause you're afraid of being hurt.
Which you might.
But what is the other alternative?
Being alone?
Hmm. Maybe. It's safer.
You know, fear trapped me in a closet my whole life.
Embarrassment kept me from admitting the truth to you every day of our marriage.
It was eating me up inside.
Until I stopped trying to control it, and stepped out.
Had faith and let it happen.
It was hard and sad, but, baby, look at us now.
Hmm?
Our divorce wasn't a failure, Athena.
We're still family, baby.
And listen, if this thing doesn't work out with this firefighter, you'll move on.
In the meantime, if he makes you happy, then why not be happy?
You deserve it.
(chiming, miniature siren wailing) BUCK: Okay, what about "G. I.?" Like G. I. Joe. "Hey, G. I." You know, that's a great nickname.
Sounds like gastrointestinal.
Yeah, I don't think so.
BOBBY: All right, everybody, listen up.
I've got an announcement to make.
I just got off the phone with the people from the calendar, and they have made their choice.
Well, no hard feelings, no matter who won.
That's good, Buck, 'cause they didn't pick you.
Well, it's obviously a fix.
No, congratulations anyway, G. I.!
(chuckles) They didn't pick him, either.
No? You?
No.
(celery crunching) No way. You got to be kidding me.
No. Congratulations, Chim.
Or should I say Mr. April?
No way. Are you serious?
BUCK: Chimney!
You're a calendar boy, now.
You serious?
Mr. April, buddy.
30 days of Chimney.
Congratulations.
You did it.
Thank you.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Hey. I'm sorry.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right.
What are you all looking at?
There's no more announcements.
Pay up.
(all groaning) Wait a minute, wait a minute, you knew?
Sir, first you two were happy at the same time, then you were both pissed off at the same time.
It wasn't hard to figure out.
And, uh, you good with this?
Girl, I'm just mad at myself for not fixing you up in the first place.
(both laugh) Staying for dinner?
I don't know. Are you cooking?
Yeah.
Thank you.
CHIMNEY: Hen.
So, uh, you want to tell me how you managed this?
(scoffs) I think they've been seeing each other for months.
Hen, you know what I'm talking about.
I never submitted myself for that calendar.
But I deleted all those pictures.
How'd you get a hold of them?
I didn't use any of those pictures.
Last year, the school bus accident on the 710, an AP photographer got a photo of you carrying a little girl across the freeway.
That's what I sent in.
Not some picture of you pretending to be a big damn hero, but an actual picture of you being a damn hero.
Because that's what you are, Chim.
And that's what a hero looks like.
You.
Mr. April. Yes!
(claps) (knuckles cracking) (phone vibrating) Laurie?
DOUG (over phone): No. It's not your boss.
I'm in her office.
And evidently, she's not your boss anymore because you quit.
Where are you, Maddie?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter 'cause we're done.
You don't get to decide when we're done. I decide!
Tell me where you are!
Then I guess I'm gonna have to come find you.
And you'd better hope that when I do, I'm in a better mood.
(grunts) (door opens, closes) (keys jingle) Leaving already?
Road ahead awaits.
I'm more concerned with the road behind you.
Maddie, what really happened with Doug?
Why are you running away from him?
No. I'm not gonna bring my little brother into this.
Standing in between you and anyone who thinks they can hurt you is exactly where I want to be standing.
Maddie, are you in some kind of danger?
The stuff that Mom and Dad hated about him, that you picked up on even as a teenager, it all got worse.
Much worse over the last year or so.
And when I threatened to leave, he threatened to kill me.
(voice breaking): And he meant it.
You know, when women in abusive relationships used to come into the hospital, I got to be honest, I would pass judgment.
Like, "Why don't you just leave him?" Now I get it.
It's like, you can't even believe it's happening.
But you broke free.
And I'm proud of you.
But now is not the time to be alone, all right?
So-so-so you...you should stay here.
All right? I-I got...I got plenty of room, and-and, hey, if Doug comes looking, then...
I know a lot of cops.
He won't.
He doesn't know you live here. He doesn't know what you do.
It's a real benefit to being married to somebody who doesn't ask any questions.
Okay, well, that's perfect.
You can start over.
I can help you. I can help you get a great nursing job at one of the hospitals.
No.
I really miss helping people, but I can't do that job every day, looking over my shoulder, wondering who's walking in the front door.
Okay. So you want to help people but not deal with them face-to-face.
Yeah.
I think I might have an idea.
MADDIE: We all feel pressure, but it's how we respond that matters.
Being a 911 dispatcher will be challenging and exhausting and can take an emotional toll.
The people who call in are scared, in need, and we are their lifeline.
But it can also be rewarding.
Calling us is probably the scariest moment of their lives.
But if we do our jobs right and help arrives in time and we get a little lucky, then maybe it doesn't have to be the worst moment of their lives.
Sounds like a lot of pressure.
I don't know if I'm up for that. You?
MADDIE: Pressure doesn't have to break us down.
It can show us who we really are. And that's good.
911 OPERATOR: You're gonna be fine.
When did the pain start?
911. What is your emergency?
MADDIE: Because in the end, it's always there.
Help is on the way.
MADDIE: The pressure.
And eventually, it has to be released.
* Rock steady, baby * That's what I feel now *
* Just call the song exactly what it is * (rumbling) (tires screeching) * Just move your hips with a feeling *
* From side to side * Sit yourself down in your car *
* And take a ride * While you're moving, rock steady *
* Rock steady, baby * Let's call this song exactly what it is *
* What it is, what it is, what it is *
* It's a funky and lowdown feeling...* (horns honking, car alarms blaring) * In the hips from left to right...* DISPATCHER: Attention, all units.
This is a citywide disaster alert.
A massive earthquake has hit Central L. A.
Be on emergency tac alert until further notice.
I repeat, be on emergency tac alert until further notice.
* Rock steady.
@@@@@@
(indistinct chatter) TEENAGE MAN: (whistles softly) Wow.
This is way nicer than the place we stayed at last night.
FATHER: And it's central to everything we're here to see.
GIRL: Disneyland?
That's a little bit further, but Harry Potter's right over that hill.
Yay! I want a wand.
MOTHER: Can we afford this?
I'm using reward points we've been saving since before Kat was born. We're good.
She's my emotional support dog.
And by refusing me entry, you are violating federal law and risking me having a panic attack.
(barks) That's a baby.
So, the prize for winning the tournament was a trip to the regional championship in Reno.
The prize for losing in the first round is all the pancakes you guys can possibly eat.
(laughter) All right, so why don't you head on down to the restaurant while I get us checked out?
Yup.
Pickens, you come with me.
A recruiter from Duke is coming to see you when we get back.
North Carolina? I don't know.
After seeing that campus at UCLA...
Oh, you mean the California girls all over it?
Look, it can't hurt to listen to what Duke and Stanford and what every other top school who's gonna try and recruit you has to say.
Whatever you say, Coach.
All right.
That's my guy. What's our motto?
Heart of a champion.
That's right.
(laughs) Still cleaning the rooms.
I guess that's what we get for arriving at checkout.
Who's hungry?
Me.
(laughs) Come here.
Ooh.
* (cell phone chimes) (elevator bell dings) * Ali. Come on in, hon.
Can't apologize enough for making you cool your heels in the lobby.
Been a crazy morning.
You know, I had to close the Miami deal, conference call with the money boys in Dubai and I'm still operating on Dallas time. (laughs) I swear, sometimes I forget where I am.
Every city starts to look the same to me.
You know, the inside of another luxury hotel suite.
So show me what you got.
Okay.
So, based on what we discussed, I have gone back to a more Mediterranean vibe for the townhouses.
Oh, yeah.
(cell phone ringing) Oh, yeah, this is...
this is terrific work.
Do you need to get that?
Nah, it's just my wife.
MOTHER: There's a walking tour that shows where they filmed old movies.
That'll pack them in.
I need to pee.
Oh, you know where it is, honey?
Yeah, I can find it.
Okay.
She okay?
Yeah, yeah. I can see her.
She likes feeling grown up.
WOMAN: The toast is touching the eggs.
Now there's gluten in my eggs. This is all wrong.
Paisley.
Now see? You've upset her.
She's gluten intolerant, too.
Ugh. Paisley.
Paisley! Oh.
Would you like some coffee?
Oh, no. No thanks.
How about a mimosa?
In the shower?
What? No.
What?
Are you out of your mind?
You are blowing this way out of proportion.
There is no proportional response to being asked by your boss to shower with him.
I'm reporting this to HR and the board.
We're a publically traded company, you pig.
HR is terrified of me and I handpicked every member of that board.
I'll invite them all to Sardinia on my boat and they will forget they ever heard of you.
I will destroy you.
Hi. It's okay.
(whimpering) Don't be afraid.
(rumbling) Kat.
(people screaming) Kat!
Whoa!
What the hell?
Earthquake.
(people screaming) Go!
Kat!
(whining) Dad!
Watch out!
Kat! Kat!
Kat!
Dad!
Paisley!
(barks) Oh, God!
Dad!
(screaming) Dad! Dad!
Pickens!
Coach!
(people screaming) (grunts) Kat!
Kat!
(electricity buzzing) Kat.
Kat!
(car alarms wailing) * Hey, Dad.
Yeah?
Hey, Dad, do you think dogs know they're dogs?
What do you mean?
You-you know, like, I'm a person and a dog is a dog.
Mm-hmm.
But do dogs just think we're bigger, less hairier, smarter dogs that walk funny?
Thank God for you, kid.
(bell rings) All right. You got to hustle up.
All right?
Love you.
Oh.
I love you, too, son.
Go to school, buddy.
You ever feel like you missed your calling, Cap?
What are you thinking?
Michelin-rated restaurant or short order cook?
CHIMNEY: I was thinking TV chef.
I mean, what you do, it's like performance art.
Mm-hmm, and much like watching cooking on TV, we never get to taste anything.
Usually by the time it hits the table, the bell goes off.
BOBBY: All right, speed round.
If you weren't doing this, what would you be doing?
Fighter pilot. Topgun. Call sign: Shogun.
(laughs) What about you, Hen?
Editorial cartoonist, The New Yorker.
I have a lot to say.
You draw?
No, it's a dream. It's not supposed to be attainable.
Topgun? You can barely drive, you rebar head.
Hey.
All right, Buckaroo.
If you were not a member of the LAFD, what would you be doing?
Uh, I don't know.
I'm not getting fired, am I?
That's inevitable.
He'd be a golden retriever.
No, a bartender. No, no, no, bouncer at a bar.
A bouncer at a strip club.
CHIMNEY: What.
HEN: What.
What's going on with you, kid?
Just traffic sucks in this town unless you're driving ten tons of engine with sirens.
It took me almost two hours to get from Abby's place to the call center downtown, then back over here.
Just told Maddie she needs to start Ubering.
How's your sister settling in down there?
Well, she's a Buckley.
Practically running the place.
Here's how shadowing works.
I talk, you listen and hopefully you learn something about being a dispatcher.
Questions? Save them for after my state-mandated, ten-minute break which will be in three hours and 12 minutes.
First thing, everybody lies.
Dr. Gregory House was right about that.
Sometimes they know that they're lying.
"Oh, I had no idea that this would happen.
I just slipped and fell on that cucumber." Other times, whatever they're experiencing in the moment is scrambling their brains.
They are the ultimate unreliable narrators.
Uh, who's Dr. House?
You're one of those, aren't you?
A reader.
The point is you can't trust people, only yourself.
If it sounds like bull, it probably is.
(phone ringing) 911, what is your emergency?
WOMAN (over phone): I'm having chest pains.
When did the pain start?
911, what is your emergency?
MAN: I was playing pinfinger and I really messed up.
There's a knife impaled in my hand.
I-I got to get it out.
No, don't pull it out. Just leave it right there.
You would think after 14 seasons of Grey's Anatomy that people would know this stuff.
How bad is it bleeding?
MAN: It's gushing.
Okay, the EMTs are on their way.
So, questions? No?
Good, then it's your turn.
Wait, my turn to take a call?
See one, do one, teach one.
FYI, this is the middle part.
I'll be here like training wheels.
(exhales) (phone ringing) 911, what is your emergency?
MAN 2: Help, please. Can't breathe.
What is your location, sir?
Ocean Park and Lincoln by the sushi place.
(under breath): Sushi restaurant at Ocean Park Boulevard and Lincoln Boulevard.
Um, are you having tightness in your chest, pain in your arms?
N-No.
Throat's swollen.
Do you have any allergies?
Shellfish.
I told them.
Okay, it sounds like you're having an allergic reaction.
Help is on the way now.
Can you elevate your legs?
(car engine revs) Uh, no.
Sir, are you out on a street?
Parking lot, in my car.
Okay, what kind of car are we looking for?
Gray Challenger.
Help is on the way. Can I see that?
He could have been unconscious by the time the EMTs arrived because they would have had no idea where to find him.
Because you were so busy with your checklist, you didn't hear the sound of the engine running.
I understand. I've been an ER nurse for the last eight years.
People out there are in crisis, and we need to see it all, no matter what their panicked minds are telling us.
Because the only sense that we get to use to solve this problem is our listening.
I'm sorry, did you say something?
Listening. Oh...
Funny?
Yeah, so funny. Yeah.
I'm glad.
(sirens wailing) *
* What you think about me * I won't try to argue * Or hold it against you * I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons *
* The season is calling * Your pictures are falling down * Hold it right there!
*
* Well, I guess this is growing up * Hey!
* Well, I guess this is growing up. * Where you planning on running, Marvin?
This is your house.
You know, if you're going to keep stealing cars, you might want to consider a less memorable hair color.
When I hear a felonious act, the suspect matches your description, I know where to find you.
This is the third time I've had to arrest you this year.
The hair is my signature.
All master criminals have one.
Yeah, all stupid ones.
I'm just getting all of my stealing done before I turn 18.
I'm joyriding, which is like borrowing the car without asking.
Only thing I steal is some gas from a tank, if you think about it.
Well, you're not going to juvie court this time, Marvin.
Ran from the police.
It's serious now.
Am I really going to jail?
Like, real jail?
You committed grown-up crimes.
Grand theft auto, evading the police, reckless driving.
You're lucky you didn't hurt anyone.
I'm not gonna make it to jail.
My mom's gonna kill me first.
(rumbling) (tires squealing) The hell?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
(gasps) Oh, my God.
(people screaming) Okay, that's at least a six.
Seven.
HEN: Get out! Get out, guys!
Come on!
CHIMNEY: Get out.
Get out. Get out. Go. Go.
Go, go, go, go!
Anybody else back there?
No.
(shouting over each other) Oh, my God!
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.
(car alarms wailing) (exhales) Brace for impact.
(phones ringing) 911. What's your emergency?
911. What's your emergency?
911. What's your emergency?
(siren wailing) (electricity crackling) Is everything okay?
Yeah. There's no service.
Texts won't even get through.
Who you trying to get ahold of?
My son. I'm trying to reach my son.
BUCK: Whoa, you got a kid?
Christopher.
He's seven.
And super adorable. I, uh, I love kids.
I love this one.
I'm all he's got.
His mother's not in the picture.
He's at school?
Yeah.
Hey, I'm sure he's fine.
(horn honking) You guys ever deal with anything like this before?
No.
(woman shouting) I have to get back in there.
No, you have to let me back in there!
My baby's in there!
Please, our daughter is still inside!
She's eight years old!
No, my daughter's inside!
Kat. Her name is Kat!
FATHER: You have to let me in there!
She's all alone! Stop it!
They seriously think that's gonna hold it up?
Let's go find the incident commander.
Any word from Athena?
Haven't been able to get ahold of her.
What about you? Karen? Denny?
Same.
Cell phones are toast everywhere.
The system must be overloaded.
Captain. Chief Williams, incident commander.
Captain Bobby Nash. How can we help you?
Hotel manager said they were between checkout and check-in when the quake hit, so they were light on guests.
We've made contact with most of those.
Multiple evac operations in progress.
All but 12 of the 68 staff have been accounted for.
It's been pretty chaotic.
The family back there said their little girl is still missing.
As long as it's still safe to do so, we'll be looking for any survivors.
What do your engineers have to say?
Looks like we had a brittle failure in the prestressed concrete section of the building's underground parking garage, causing it to pancake at an angle.
Right now the reinforced steel is the only thing keeping it from completely collapsing. One good aftershock...
And the whole thing could come down.
A high-rise is supposed to be the safest place to be when an earthquake hits.
Not when you're built right on top of a fault line.
This quake was a 7.1.
Northridge was just a 6.7.
7.1 -- that makes the largest in SoCal in 20 years.
And the last one was in Joshua Tree.
BOBBY: How many crews do you have in there?
Not enough.
We've put in a request for Heavy Rescue 3, but they're on their way to a freeway collapse.
We can use every hand we can get.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Okay, listen up.
Here's how you make it to the end of the day.
You don't worry about the things that you can't do anything about.
Focus on one task at a time.
I can't order you guys to go inside that building, and I'm not gonna judge you if you decide not to.
Hen, you got a kid, so...
Yeah.
And I'd hope if someone whose job it was to save him had the chance, they'd do it.
No matter what.
Where do you want us?
POLICE OFFICER: Hey.
You guys will want to see this.
CHIMNEY: We could set up a bag street-side in case that window gives.
Nobody works under that side of the building.
Somebody's gonna have to get him from the inside.
Buck, you say that's the 11th floor?
BUCK: I would.
I bet we could take the ladder to that fourth floor.
Cut the distance in half.
Head on up.
After Northridge, FEMA spent $200 million retrofitting every school in the LAUSD.
Ceiling tiles, lighting fixtures...
Eddie, your kid is in the safest place he can be.
Thought that was a high-rise.
MAY: I still don't have service.
MICHAEL: Neither does half of the people in L. A.
We can try your mom again later.
(horns honking) Come on.
MICHAEL: E-Excuse me.
Excuse me, I'm looking for my son.
The reunion gate station is located at the gymnasium, sir.
Okay.
MAY: Dad, I see him.
I see him, I see him!
MICHAEL: Harry!
Hey, Dad.
(panting, laughs) Are you okay?
Yeah.
Dad, did you see the school?
Yeah.
We probably won't come back for another month.
Isn't that awesome?
No, Harry, it's not awesome.
A lot of people got hurt.
And there's still some people missing.
MAY: You should try Mom again.
She'd want to know we have Harry.
Give me your phone.
Uh, still no service.
Wait, where's Mom?
She's working.
(indistinct police radio chatter) If you can drive, move your car to the shoulder!
Clear a path for emergency vehicles!
All your guys accounted for?
Fire and rescue's on the way.
Yeah, thank God.
All right, you need to get people out of their cars before the rest of this overpass comes down.
If they can be moved, move them.
If you're not sure, come and find me.
But mind yourself first. You want to be a hero, be the one who lives to tell the tale.
(man coughs) (man groaning) Sir. Sir, can you hear me?
Can you tell me your name?
Dean.
Dean? I'm Sergeant Grant.
There was an earthquake. You were in an accident.
But help is on the way.
Ah! I can't move, I...
I can't get out!
All right, enhance your calm, Dean.
We're gonna get you out of here as fast as we can.
(sniffs) DEAN: I smell gas.
Okay.
I smell gas.
(phone buzzing) Michael, Michael, are the kids with you?
Michael, you're breaking up!
MARVIN: Let me out!
You wouldn't treat a dog this way.
A dog would be more help right now.
Michael, Michael, are you with...Michael, you're breaking up.
Just tell me the kids are with you.
(phone beeps off) DEAN: Ah! Hey!
Hey! Help!
(Dean continues shouting) Ah!
How you doing, Dean?
I feel dizzy, and it's getting hot.
It's so hot.
Are those all the extinguishers you could find?
Underground gas line must have ruptured when the car hit the pavement.
We can't put the fire out with a constant energy source keeping it going.
It's like this car is sitting on top of a stovetop.
DEAN: Help!
Oh, God, please!
I don't want to burn.
Can't we cut him out?
He's jammed in there.
I need something bigger to cool this thing down.
(crying) The cement truck.
Who has the keys?
Miguel.
But-but he's helping people on the other side.
DEAN: Help!
Help!
Can you hot-wire that cement truck?
That's a 2004 Peterbilt 357 MTM...
I don't need the review from Car and Dumbass.
I need you to bring it over to that fire.
Can you?
I can hot-wire that bad boy with my eyes closed.
I'm giving you the authority to commandeer that truck and that truck only for official police business.
But if you run away, Marvin, and that man dies, your life as you know it will be over.
My life's already over.
You will wish you were in jail if you piss me off.
RESCUE WORKER: All right, we have to clear out!
DEAN: Please, God!
(crying) (grunts) Marvin!
(engine starts) Yeah!
I'm the king!
Push, push.
Push it.
Okay, hit it.
(sizzling) Come on, come on.
(Marvin grunts) All right, hold.
Passenger side.
You cooling down?
Yeah. Thank you.
All right. You hang in there, Dean.
Help's coming.
(panting) PARAMEDIC: Hey. Sir, we're gonna get you out, all right? Just stay calm.
DEAN: Okay.
MARVIN: Look at me, using my superpowers for good.
I feel like the Dark Knight.
Don't get carried away.
So we good? Can I go home?
That's up to the judge.
I just saved the day.
Doesn't that make up for the bad I did this morning?
Listen, I'll write a nice letter on your behalf to the judge.
Good deeds may get you into heaven, but the law is the law, honey, and once I put you in the back of my squad car, there's no getting out.
Thank you for helping me and that man today.
The next time you get a chance to do the wrong thing, think about how bad you feel right now, and how good it felt to do the right thing.
BOBBY: Watch your step, guys.
L. A. Fire and Rescue!
MAN (faintly): Can you hear me?
CHIMNEY: Is anybody down here?
Hello?
HEN: Bobby.
Yeah?
All right.
All right, guys, let's keep going.
L. A. Fire and Rescue.
CHIMNEY: Anybody down here?
COACH: Right here!
All right, we got a voice over there, guys. Let's go.
You need any help?
All good.
There's a kid maybe 50 feet back.
Needs EMTs bad.
HEN: Is it a little girl?
No, a young African-American kid.
Fire and Rescue. Hello?
COACH: Yeah. Right here!
Thank God, man, he's stuck!
BOBBY: All right, we're coming.
All right, guys, the floor is out.
It's stable.
(young man groans) Hey, he's stuck. Right here.
BOBBY: All right, help is on the way.
(groans) They're here, man.
Stick with me, right here.
What's your name, son?
Jeff.
Jeff? Hold on.
Hang tight. Jeff, we're right here.
BOBBY: Listen, you already try and move some debris, see if you can pull him free?
FIREFIGHTER: The second we touched the beam, the whole megillah above started shifting.
BOBBY: That's what I was afraid of.
All right, guys, this debris is holding up this section of ceiling.
If we try and pull this out of the way, this whole area could cave in.
(Jeff groans) HEN: You're gonna be all right.
Gonna be all right.
HEN: Just gonna stabilize you.
I-I can't move it, Coach.
How bad is it?
COACH: Hey, bones heal. All right?
You'll be all right. All right? Just a little setback.
You remember Paul George? Gordon Hayward? Huh?
I'm starting to think different about this California school.
Maybe it's not the place for me.
Yeah, Jeff has every division one college in the country recruiting him right now.
Sir, this firefighter is gonna lead you out of here.
No, screw that, I'm staying, all right?
This kid is a son to me.
All right? He's in my charge.
BOBBY: Okay, we need to focus all of our attention on Jeff right now.
We can't be worried about your safety, too. Now go.
I'm good, Coach.
Heart of a champion.
I love you, kid.
He's coming home with us.
(grunts) Easy, easy.
(Jeff groans) BOBBY: What do we got, Hen?
Tibia and fibula are crushed. Don't think the debris cut through any major arteries, though.
Okay, kid, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
You're in a bad spot here.
We have two choices.
The first guarantees you get out of here, the second carries more risk.
What's the guaranteed way?
We get a trauma surgeon in here and we cut you free.
Free? You mean from my leg?
Yeah.
Listen.
We'd put you out. You wouldn't feel any pain.
You'd wake up in the hospital safe and sound.
Without my leg. No way.
I'd rather die here. What's the other option?
Well, we shore up this pocket we're in and then we get an air bag to lift up that beam that's pinning you down and we pull you free.
Yeah, yeah, do that. Air bags and all that.
All right, listen, I know that sounds simple, but it's not because this debris is holding up this ceiling and if it starts to give way, this whole side of the restaurant could collapse.
Me and my team, we're gonna be able to get out of here.
I don't think you will.
All right, man, you got parents, a girlfriend.
And they're gonna love you whether you play basketball or not.
I know. I know they do, but I worked so hard.
(cries) This is my dream, my whole life.
Look...I may be able to live without my leg, but I don't know if I can live knowing I could have saved it and didn't.
All right. We're committed.
We're gonna get him out of here.
Let's shore this up. Get an air bag.
Copy that.
As first responders continue the painstaking task of searching every floor of the hotel's 14 stories, experts fear that a significant aftershock could result in a sudden collapse.
ANCHOR: Well, we all remember how many brave first responders lost their lives on 9/11 when those buildings came down.
And that's the image that haunts the scene today, Martha, but that's not stopping the brave firefighters and rescue workers who continue to comb for survivors.
So much for the little training cruise.
Ladies and gents, listen up, please.
You've all completed a significant portion of your training.
The rest is gonna be a crash course.
All we're gonna be asking from you today is to basically roll calls.
More than 50% of what we're getting right now is nuisance calls, nonemergencies.
People telling us that they felt an earthquake, wanting to know when their power will be restored.
Your job today will be to keep the lines clear.
What if it's a real emergency?
If you think you can help, then do it.
If not, send it up the chain and one of us will.
All right?
My brother is a firefighter and I think he might be in that building.
We all have people we love out there.
The best thing we can do for them right now is our job.
(metal creaks and groans) EDDIE: It's only six flights.
Not exactly Mount Everest.
(panting): Yeah, except Everest might not tip over and crush you like a bug.
You good, Buck?
Yeah.
Let's keep going.
If you're not essential, get clear.
Okay. As soon as this thing inflates enough to pull him out, let's get him out of here.
You ready, Jeff?
JEFF: Yeah.
But if things go wrong, leave me and save yourselves.
This is my choice to try this.
All four of us are getting out of here.
That's right, with all eight of our legs.
Now, Jeff, Hen gave you some morphine, but when we move you it's still gonna hurt like hell.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Come on, we got this.
Yeah, come on, we the champs.
Yeah, we can do this, a'ight?
Let's go. We the champs. Heart of a champion.
We got this, we got this.
Heart of a champion.
Heart of a champion.
Let's do it!
All right.
Just like that. We got it.
Let's go.
In three...two...
one.
* Wading in the water * Just trying not to crack...
(Jeff groaning) He's not moving.
* Yeah, that's where we are, babe...* All right. Cap. Cap, it's not gonna hold.
It's not gonna hold.
Just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more. See if you can get him out.
Can you get him out?
(indistinct shouting) Go!
Go!
I got him! I got him!
(Jeff groaning) BOBBY: Get me dual grade. Watch the tip.
You're doing great.
Good job, champ, come on.
Heart of a champion, right? You're doing great.
You're doing great.
HEN: Come on, guys, get him up.
And on me, on three. One, two, three.
(Jeff groans) All right, easy.
You're doing great, champ, doing great.
Thank you.
All right.
Easy. Easy.
All right, easy.
All right, Chim, you follow.
Copy.
HEN: Hang in there, Jeff!
You got him?
BOBBY: All right, Trauma, he's coming your way, make sure he keeps that leg.
HEN: Come on.
BOBBY: Come on, Hen.
(grunts) Kat!
Kat!
* (grunts) All right.
You ready?
Yeah, on three.
One, two, three.
(grunting) EDDIE: Hello! Hello!
LAFD!
ALI: In here! In here!
HARLOW: In here!
ALI: Please.
This one here.
(grunting) (grunts) All right.
In you go.
Hello! LAFD!
We're in here!
In here!
(Ali whimpers) Oh, God.
(grunts) Thank God. Please, please, get me out of here.
Whoa, whoa, ma'am, I-I need you to just sit tight.
I will come and I will get you.
Okay?
Okay.
HARLOW: Uh, no offense, but I think this might be a situation where "women and children first" does not apply.
Did you just say "no offense"?
Everything about you is offensive.
First date?
Yeah, God, he wishes.
Amazingly, that sweaty, fat, pock-marked pig is married with five kids.
Didn't stop him from asking me to shower with him.
Man, have you not watched the news at all over the past year?
EDDIE: All right, you're good.
BUCK: All right.
Seriously, catch up with the times.
HARLOW: All right, fine, so I'm a dinosaur.
A forgotten relic of a forgotten age.
For God's sake, just get me the hell out of here.
Hurry.
I'm gonna throw you a rope, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna need you to try and secure yourself.
Okay.
You ready?
Yeah.
All right.
(glass creaking) Don't move!
(grunts) Don't breathe.
(indistinct chatter) Wait a second. I remember him. I remember him.
He was in the restaurant.
I remember him. Go ask.
Did you find our daughter?
Did you find Kat? She was on the same floor as him.
We've still got people in there.
They're looking for her right now.
Somebody has to have seen her.
She was on the same floor as him.
Can you tell me what she was wearing?
She was wearing a pink shirt.
Pink.
It has ruffles on it.
Yes.
She has light blue jeans on.
Okay, sir, what kind of shirt?
Um, I don't know.
Button up?
It was like a, like a neck.
Yes.
Okay, what color were her shoes?
Uh, purple shoes.
Pink.
Pink? Were they pink?
Purple-pink.
All right, thanks. That is her shoe.
Parents said she was on her way to the restroom when the quake hit.
Restrooms are cleared, Cap.
HEN: Oh, my God. She could be anywhere.
She could be wandering about, trapped under this debris.
BOBBY: Let's get USAR back in here with thermal cams.
Hurry.
(glass cracking) Hurry, it's starting to crack.
All right, I'm gonna come around to you.
You need to stay totally still, sir.
Don't even talk.
* 221, you're far from home.
Well, all hands on deck, right?
(Hen chuckles) Anything?
FIREFIGHTER: No, not yet.
HEN: Kat!
Kat!
Oh, God.
Please don't let this be the end.
All right. I'm gonna tie this webbing around you, and we're gonna get you away from the glass.
(whimpers) Okay. Okay.
(rumbling) Oh! Oh, God!
(Ali screams) Aftershock! Aftershock!
Help me!
HARLOW: Oh, God! Oh, God!
BOBBY: Chim, get outta there!
Get back! Get back! Fall back!
Chim, come on, Chim.
Hen, get clear!
(Hen screams) Hen!
(Hen screaming) Hen!
Hen! Hen!
Hen!
Hen!
ALI: Oh, no, my God!
Oh, God.
Hold on! Hold on!
No, don't!
(Harlow screams) (gasps) (heavy thud) (woman screams) Hey! Hey! Hey!
(panting) (Ali screaming) Give me your other hand.
(Eddie grunts)
 @@@@@@
MALE REPORTER: A 7.1 earthquake has rocked the Southland, and 250,000 homes are without electricity.
And for most, there is an urgent need for...
FEMALE REPORTER: Traffic lights out all over the city. Driving is extremely hazardous.
...will be posted on our website.
The most deaths of any single building collapse: ...currently backlogged.
33 in total.
Callers are urged to refrain from dialing 911 unless there is a real and true emergency.
No, sir, martial law has not been declared, and even if it had, I'm pretty sure that it's still illegal to just shoot anyone who comes on your property.
911. What is your emergency?
Sorry, ma'am. We can't really spare any units to come look for your missing cat.
Maybe put out a can of tuna?
Yes, open.
911. What is your emergency?
Dispatch, we have a report of looters at the Big 5 on Wilshire and San Vicente...
Wait, there are two Wilshire and San Vicentes?
I-I'm transferring you. Please stay on the line.
Don't hang up.
I shouldn't be doing this.
You're doing fine. I've got my eye on you.
People's lives are at stake here.
Look, we're stretched thin on our best day, and today is definitely not our best.
Just get the frivolous calls off the line, help the ones you can, and keep sending the higher priority calls up the chain.
You can do this.
(sighs) (line ringing) 911. What is your emergency?
DREW (on phone): Uh, I-I need an ambulance.
Uh, 6057 Comstock, in Montebello.
What is the nature of your emergency?
DREW: My wife. She-She's just over 32 weeks pregnant, a-and she went into labor about an hour ago.
Tell me your name.
I-I'm Drew. Uh, Drew Hudson.
My wife is-is Ainsley.
Okay, Drew, 32 weeks isn't so early that we're in the danger zone.
I want you to monitor her breathing and time her contractions for me.
No, I said I need an ambulance!
I'm sorry, but we're backed up due to the earthquake.
As soon as I have something available...
What do you mean?!
You're-you're 911!
I understand, sir, but our resources are spread thin all over the city.
No, I need help!
It's not coming.
Help is not coming, Drew.
Oh, God.
But it's okay.
I-I'm here. I'm a trained nurse, and I've delivered a lot of babies.
I can talk you through this.
No, you can't.
She's unconscious.
We were on our way to the hospital when-when the second one hit.
She fell.
The baby was coming.
It-It was coming.
Drew, can you tell me where she's been hurt?
Uh, her-her head.
It's-it's bleeding.
Is there a lot of blood?
No, no. Uh, s-some. Not a lot.
Okay, good. Is she breathing?
Yeah. Barely, but yes.
Where is she now, Drew?
I-I put her on the couch.
Okay, but we don't want her lying flat -- can you gently move her onto her left side?
Yes.
Good. Make sure her head is elevated.
This is gonna keep her airway open.
Ainsley and the baby need to breathe.
When can someone be here?
Probably at least an hour before a truck can get there.
(clears throat) Drew, you said when the last aftershock hit, you were getting ready to take Ainsley to the hospital.
Which hospital?
Uh, Montebello Presbyterian.
Sh-Should I take her there?
Traffic lights out here and here.
This artery's gonna be jammed.
Wait.
If you can't get the first responders to the caller...
Get the caller to the first responders.
Okay, Drew, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
I want you to take Ainsley to your car.
I want her on her left side, head elevated, just like we've been doing.
Am I taking her to the hospital?
No, we don't have time for that.
I am sending you to a fire.
Captain, 911.
This is Captain Martinez.
Captain Martinez, this is dispatcher Maddie Kendall at Parker Center.
I have a young couple in a Volkswagen Passat coming to you.
The female is eight months pregnant and unconscious.
She was in active labor when she was injured.
They could really use a miracle today.
(honking) We just might have a few of those left.
I see them.
MARTINEZ: EMTs!
We're gonna get 'em treated and transported.
MADDIE: Thank you, Captain.
DREW: You got to help her.
Thank you.
Great work.
(line ringing) 911. What is your emergency?
Caltech's calling that last aftershock a 4.9.
16th aftershock so far.
I want a real-time assessment of new damage, and a comprehensive report on structural integrity throughout the building. Call your people and get me updates.
Excuse me. No one's telling us anything about my daughter. It's been hours.
Sir, search and rescue operations are continuing.
As soon as we know anything, you'll be advised.
I want to go in there myself. Let me go in and look for her.
I can't allow you to do that.
I'm afraid we'd wind up having to rescue you, too.
And your family needs you right now.
My family needs my daughter back.
Oh, it's gonna be a long night.
What about the grid? Show me who's left in there.
GPS looks like it's got a bead on everybody, but the 118's lost contact with a firefighter.
Who?
BOBBY: Hen, do you copy?
This is Captain Nash for Henrietta Wilson, do you copy?
Cap, I think I got a visual.
There's a pocket, probably four feet.
Can't see her, though.
Hen! Hen, can you hear me?
Captain.
Yeah.
We've locked in on her GPS.
Let me see.
There's been no movement.
BOBBY: Okay, Chim, it looks like she's about three meters deep over there inside that pancaked section of the garage.
If we do this wrong, We risk bringing the rest of this down on top of her.
So we go slow.
But not too slow. She's in there, Chim.
Roger that.
BUCK: That's it. You're doing great.
You've, uh, you've done this before, haven't you?
ALI: Yeah. It was, uh, my major at the Rhode Island School of Design.
Sorry. Sarcasm is my fallback for pretty much everything.
BUCK: I totally get it.
I got you.
Okay.
You think he'll still be on the sidewalk when we get down there?
No.
And we're not going out that side, anyway.
EDDIE: Let's hustle up, you two.
We don't want to be here for the next aftershock.
Wait, what do you mean, the next aftershock?
Come on.
(groans) There we go.
You're gonna be fine.
Oh!
You're gonna be fine.
He's right behind you.
ALI: Okay.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
We're not getting out this way.
Now what?
We go back up.
Back up?
BOBBY (over comm): Ladder 118, respond.
This is Captain Nash. I need a head count.
Ladder 118 responding. Diaz, Buckley, we're good, Cap.
WOMAN (over comm): Castillo and Jackson responding.
MAN: Paulson, Marcus and Riley responding.
CHIMNEY: Chimney responding.
BOBBY: Hen, do you copy? Hen?
This is Captain Nash for Henrietta Wilson. Do you copy?
Is that a friend of yours?
Let's keep moving.
(grunting) HEN: Bobby!
Buck, Chim?
Help! Bobby! Buck!
(grunts) (grunting, panting) Hey, anybody down here?
(man groans) Hey! Hello?
(man groans) (Hen grunting) 221, right?
Yeah. Russ.
Hen. 118.
Where...Where's your radio, Russ? Mine is toast.
I don't have one. All radios were issued out.
It's not my shift.
Oh, my God, you came in on your day off, Russ?
Yeah. Nothing new on Netflix.
(weak laugh) (grunting) (cries out) (straining) All right, there's got to be a jack in one of these cars. All right.
RUSS: Don't waste your strength or your time.
(grunts) None of that, Russ. We're both getting out of here.
Okay?
I'm not.
Fractured pelvis, flail chest -- even I couldn't save me, and...
you don't know me, but I'm good.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I'm better.
Yeah?
(coughing) Hold on. Hang in there, Russ.
Hang in there.
I'm not gonna make it 20 minutes.
Help's not coming.
Not in time, anyway. So, please, my kit.
The morphine.
Give me a bolus.
Oh, give me three. (gasping) I'll give you one, just to keep you comfortable, but we're not giving up, okay?
You married, Hen?
I am.
I hope you make it back to your husband.
Wife.
Oh, yeah? I had one of those.
She was always worrying that I wouldn't...
make it back home to see her.
Decided maybe it's better if I just stopped coming home altogether.
I think maybe she was...
onto something. (gasps) My people are right above us, okay?
Believe me when I tell you...
Russ?
Russ!
Damn it.
All right.
It looks like we are in pretty good shape.
No structural damage.
But that sprinkler system -- man, that's another story.
REPORTER: ...reports are still coming in about possible casualties caused by the 7.1 earthquake that hit Southern California.
This is an unprecedented emergency that has swept across...
Oh, come on. Hey, you guys, I thought you were cleaning up this mess.
The damage is widespread...
We wanted to watch the news.
Oh, speaking of unprecedented events. Wow.
.. but at this point we are urging everyone who's able to watch this: please stay where you are.
That is...
(sighs) Okay.
I asked you guys to clean up the mess and go through the earthquake kits.
Go do that now, please.
You just said the house was fine.
Why do you care about those books more than Mom?
What did you just say to me?
Listen...
I have been worrying about your mom since before you were born.
That just goes with the territory.
But she is out there doing her job just like she does every day, so we are not going to imagine the worst-case scenario.
We're gonna have faith that she's okay and be happy to see her when she comes home. Do you understand?
But today's not like every other day, Dad.
Okay. Let's go.
Where?
Get a sweater.
And the earthquake kits.
Are we gonna go look for Mom?
You guys got five seconds to get in the car.
(indistinct shouting) (gunshot) (sirens wailing) MAN: Take it easy.
LAPD. I need everyone to back up.
Keep your hands where we can see them.
We ain't the ones shooting.
Thank God. These people are crazy.
You have a license for that?
Yes, ma'am.
I have all the paperwork in the back.
I can't expect you people to be here all the time.
All right, well, we're here now. Tell me what's going on.
Exactly what it looks like. They tried to loot my store.
I thought the people in this neighborhood were decent folk, but apparently they think everything's free if an earthquake hits.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm, mmm, mmm. Hey, Joe, looters -- they tend to bring stuff they want to steal to the register, do they?
I brought that stuff here.
And when was that?
After you popped off your shotgun, you decided to tidy up a bit?
How much you charging for that case of water?
$14.99.
Liar.
OFFICER: Step back, ma'am.
ATHENA: Hey, miss, how much was this man charging you for a case of water?
A hundred dollars.
Supply and demand.
Are you familiar with penal code 396, the anti-price gouging law?
It specifically states that jackasses like yourself are prohibited from raising the price of consumer goods by more than ten percent after a state of emergency has been declared.
Was a state of emergency officially declared?
The San Andreas Fault declared one just before lunch today.
You may have noticed.
Look, if I don't raise the price, two or three people will buy it all.
Upping the cost ensures that everyone gets a shot.
Oh, so you're just thinking of your fellow man when you decided to fleece them.
Well, not today.
These people were not intruders.
The sign on your door says "open," and you are not their victim.
Quite the opposite, by the looks of things.
Now, there are people in real need.
This city is under serious distress, and all you can think about is padding your own pockets.
I have a right...
So, you have got yourself a choice.
I can write you up for price gouging and you can face a year in jail, or...
we can overlook your ignorance of the law, and maybe we can come up with some other arrangement.
Like what?
Oh, like, you tell me.
(sighs) I guess I could, I don't know, like you said, raise the prices slightly.
Ten percent?
Ten percent off?
20 percent.
50 percent off everything in the store.
Now, that's more like it.
Okay, folks, it's half-price day!
(cheering, applause) (indistinct chatter) Pleasure doing business with you.
Hi. LAFD?
BILL: That's right. Bill Jenks, liaison.
Maddie Buckley. Crazy day.
Do you have any idea what's going on at the Hollywood Palm Hotel?
Pretty much just what's been on the news.
It's a mess. Aftershock caused another collapse.
We've got some people missing.
Well, I think that my brother might be in that hotel.
Do you know if any of the missing are from the 118?
I don't. I'm sorry.
If I hear anything else, I'll come find you.
(whispers): Oh, please be okay.
(grunting) Here you go.
There you go. Easy.
Miss, there's this egress on the north stairwell of this floor.
ALI: What if it's blocked, too?
Can't you guys get a ladder into one of the windows?
It's too risky.
Building shifted too much.
No, we got this, Abby.
We'll get you out of here.
Ali.
What?
You called me Abby. My name's Ali.
Uh, yeah. Sorry.
Um, Abby is my...It's complicated.
Isn't it always?
BUCK: Uh, she's in Europe. She's traveling.
For the first time, I'm glad she's not around.
I don't need the worry.
(grunts) (sighs) Having someone to worry about sounds...
nice, actually.
All I do is work.
What?
It's after 5:00.
It's not like it slowed us down.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
BATARI: Is anyone there?
You guys hear that?
Help! Is anyone there?
(Batari groans) I knew help would come.
EDDIE: That's right. We're here, we got you, buddy.
All right, don't move. Just relax, okay?
I need you to stay as still as possible.
Okay, we got to roll him over.
On three. One, two, three.
(screams) I...uh, I soiled myself.
Forget about that, okay?
BATARI: Not my proudest moment.
(groaning) Can you wiggle your toes for me?
Numbness in his legs, loss of bladder control.
Spinal injury.
We got to move him out now.
On what? We don't have a backboard, and every millimeter counts.
You see anything?
Guys. What about this?
Ironing board.
Could work, but how are we gonna get him down the stairwell?
Maybe we don't use the stairwell.
At least we're not blocked by any debris.
Or an elevator.
ALI: Um, how much do you think that weighs?
2,500. 3,000 pounds?
I like our chances.
Yeah.
(grunts) (shouts) (shouts) Damn it.
(panting) (beep) Uh, hey, babe, it's, uh, it's me.
I, um...
listen, I just-I just wanted to say that I, uh...
(cries) I wish I could promise you that I was coming home tonight, but, um...
after you took me back, you know, I-I swore that I would never lie to you again.
And, baby, it's, uh...
it's not looking too good for me right now.
I love you.
I love you and I love Denny so much.
And, uh, and whatever happens...I just need you to know that...that I didn't give up, okay?
That I fought.
I fought to the end. I fought.
I fought to come home to you, okay?
(beep) (shouts) (grunting) (barking) Hey. Hey.
Lassie, go get help.
Okay.
Knock it off.
Paisley.
Okay, Paisley, show me the way out.
All right.
(barking) MAY: I didn't know our church even did this.
Yeah, a lot of people are in need right now.
Not everybody got by with just broken glass and an overturned bookshelf.
Mom's not here.
No, she isn't.
Then why are we?
To be of service. Okay?
Hey. (laughs) Grants.
How good to see you.
Hi, Ms. Lorna.
Hey, come here. Mmm.
Harry.
Athena working, is she?
Oh, yeah, she is.
You know I'm gonna put y'all to work.
And that's why we're here.
All right.
Come on. (chuckles) (indistinct chatter) Thank you.
Are you okay?
Mom said church.
That's where to go when things go bad.
So you're looking for your mom?
Wait here until she finds me.
She might not be able to find you under here.
Why don't we go wait over there?
You could still see the doors.
And I'll wait with you.
I'm worried about my mom, too.
MS. LORNA: You and Athena have done such a good job with them.
They are wonderful children.
MICHAEL: They take after their mother.
(Ms. Lorna chuckles) I give you some of the credit.
Eh.
You're worried.
We haven't been able to reach Athena all day.
I'm trying to stay strong for the kids.
You know, keep them out of their head.
(chuckles) Well...
may I pray with you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come on.
How you doing, Batari?
How you feeling?
Not dead yet.
Yeah.
You guys are doing great.
You're almost there.
Eight more feet, Buck.
All right.
Get down here, Buck.
All right, on my way. You ready?
Okay.
All right.
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay. Okay.
(rumbling) Is the building vibrating?
(Ali shouts) Eddie! Eddie, kick that door open!
I got you, okay?
(screams) Cover!
Let's go, Buck! Move your ass!
All right, here we come.
Here we come!
Aah!
(elevator crashes) (panting) I told you I liked our chances.
(indistinct chatter) Cap, you good?
BOBBY: I'm good.
You good?
We're good.
Now we're back to where we started.
BOBBY: All right, well, we start again.
Captain Nash, Firefighter Wilson's GPS.
There's been movement.
Chim, look at this. She's on the other side of us.
Yeah, she's on the move, but where's she going?
(barking) Paisley, where'd you go?
(barking) Kat?
Oh, my God. I've been looking for you, baby.
Are you hurt?
No, but I fell.
Yeah, me, too.
(chuckles) Here, look.
Look what I got.
There you go.
That's much better.
Come on.
BOBBY: Pillars in the south side of the garage haven't collapsed, so she must've found a pocket of space in there and moved through.
South side of the parking garage?
Yeah. We've been attacking this from the wrong angle.
We're gonna head south.
All right? South side of the parking garage.
This is Captain Nash. We are on the move.
I need jackhammers, diamond saws, jaws, every heavy duty piece of equipment you have and every available pair of hands.
We are going down to the southern corner of the garage, level B3.
MIRANDA (over radio): Negative, Captain.
Engineers have warned of a possible complete collapse.
We need to begin the evacuation.
No can do. We still have a firefighter trapped down here.
I'm sorry. I understand.
This is a direct order.
All right, guys, evacuate. Come on.
Double-time. Let's go.
Everybody out. Come on.
Up and out, guys.
Get up to safety.
Up and out. Let's go, let's go.
Cap, we can't leave Hen behind.
She'd be here till the end if it were one of us.
I know.
I can't ask anyone else to defy a direct order.
Why are the first responders leaving the building?
Our daughter's still in there.
I'm sorry.
I'm going back in.
Sir...
No! No! No!
Got to go back, sir.
Let me in there!
CHIMNEY: So have you given much thought to what you'll do after we're fired?
BOBBY: We were ordered to leave the building.
We're just leaving a different way.
Yeah, by taking a detour to the bottom of the parking garage?
Yeah.
It's a choice.
BOBBY: Watch your step.
Hen? Hen.
CHIMNEY: Hen, can you hear us?
Think that ramp is on the other side of this wall?
Yeah. Should be right over there.
Whoa.
So the only thing that stands between us and Hen is that.
We're gonna make it through this, Chim, just you and me, without any help or heavy equipment.
Piece of cake.
All right, let's see what we can find.
Copy that.
Chim.
(car alarms wailing) Get the valet.
See what we got.
All right.
All right.
BOBBY: All right, scoop 'em up. Let's go.
All right, let's see what we got here.
(alarm chirps) Got one, Cap.
All right. Keep going.
All right, got a jack, tools.
CHIMNEY: Got another one.
All right, see what you can find, Chim.
CHIMNEY: Got a toolbox, a jack.
BOBBY: Got some rope here.
(alarm chirps) Cap.
Yeah?
You got to see this.
Thinking what I'm thinking?
BOBBY: Snow chains.
(engine starts) All right.
All right, Chim, ease it forward.
It's coming.
You're good. Keep going, Chim.
How we looking?
Looking good.
What happened?
Chain snapped.
We have any more chain?
No.
But I think it's far enough out that we can get back behind it and push it out the rest of the way.
BUCK: Looks like we got here just in time, then.
Yeah, seems like they were planning on having all the fun without us.
Heard over the radio you needed some equipment and available hands down here.
You know you guys are disobeying a direct order.
And they'll be duly reprimanded, as soon as we're done here.
Looks like you're gonna have to reprimand yourself, as well.
I'm seriously considering it.
Your people are very persuasive and persistent.
One shot, Captain.
Either way, no one's coming to rescue us.
(indistinct chatter) Keep going, Chim, we got to get it clear.
It's clear now. We need some support beams.
(indistinct chatter continuing) You got her?
Straight ahead, straight ahead.
There you go.
MAN: Clear the rubble.
(grunts) Get up there.
Three, two, one.
(barking) BUCK: Hen?
Hen, are you there?
MAN: Coming out, guys.
Come on.
Hey, fellas. (coughs) All right, let's get you out of here.
Come on.
Down here, we got you.
(grunting) (indistinct chatter) Watch your step.
(laughing) Hollywood Palm's been evacuated.
All members of the 118 are safe and accounted for.
Thank you.
Thank you.
911. What is your emergency?
WOMAN: There's this weird light in the sky, like a glowing cloud.
Did something else happen?
A glowing cloud...
W...Wait, is there power where you are?
No power here. Not a light for miles.
Is everything okay?
I think what you're seeing is the Milky Way.
The city's usually so bright you're not able to see it.
Oh, geez. (chuckles) Well, now I feel...
Sorry to bother you.
You must be pretty busy there.
It's been a day.
Well, thank you.
All of you.
*
* I * I wish you could swim * Like the dolphins * Like dolphins can swim * Though nothing * Nothing will keep us together *
* We can beat them * Forever and ever * Oh, we can be heroes * Just for one day (mouthing) * I * I will be king * And you * You will be queen * Though nothing...
(phone buzzing) Hey. Service.
* We can be heroes * Just for one day * We can be us * Just for one day * I * I can remember * I remember *
* Standing * By the wall * By the wall *
* And the guns * Shot above our heads * Over our heads *
* And we kissed * As though nothing could fall * Nothing could fall *
* And the shame * Was on the other side * Oh, we can beat them * Forever and ever * Then we could be heroes * Just for one day * We can be heroes * We can be heroes * We can be heroes.
Smells good.
(chuckles) Well, you know how I do.
(phone rings) (chuckles) Oh.
Hey. How's my man?
BOBBY: I need to see you.
(chuckles) I need to see you, too, but I have to feed these kids and the roads are still a mess.
I need to see you. Can you come out front?
(hangs up) You came all this way just to see me?
I would've walked if I had to.
Hey.
Hey.
You know what? I thought about knocking on the door, but I figured that wasn't the best way for your kids to meet me the first time.
(chuckles) Yeah, that's probably wise.
How was your day, honey?
Oh, pretty standard.
I like your outfit.
(chuckles) I was worried about you all day.
Yeah, I was worried about you, too.
It was nice having something so important to worry about.
I had to work hard to put it aside to get the job done.
I haven't had that in a long time.
Excuse me, what is all of this silliness?
Hi. I'm-I'm Bobby.
We met a while back at Hen's party.
Of course.
Yeah, Bobby just came to check on me.
And you have him standing out here after the day he's probably had.
Bobby, please, come inside.
Uh, no, thank you, but maybe another time.
Nonsense. I already set your plate.
And, uh...
the kids are excited to meet you.
(mouths) (sighs) Um...
(Athena chuckles) (laughs)
@@@@@@
(alarm blaring) (alarm stops) ("Milagro" by Gloria Estefan playing) Rise and shine, little man.
Let's do this.
Let's do this.
(Christopher grunting) Keep going, my little Superman.
Whoa.
Oh, a little bit too much.
Let's share it.
(sighs): Finally.
MADDIE: The Oxford Dictionary defines "rut" as "a habit or pattern of behavior that has become dull and unproductive but is hard to change." The word is also defined as "a long, deep track made by the repeated passage of the wheels of vehicles." There is some comfort to be taken in the second definition, for when you find yourself stuck in a rut, you can be sure others have been there before you.
(clattering) (indistinct chatter) Son of a bitch.
Dwayne, it's George.
Those ninja street artist guys are back again, man.
DWAYNE: Hold the button down. I can't hear you.
Hey! Don't you move.
No, no!
I said don't move!
Don't move!
(grunts) Come back! Oh, God!
(grunting) Aah!
LAFD. Step back.
GEORGE: Please help me! Please help me!
Someone help me, please!
CHIMNEY: Whoa.
Whatever you do, brother, don't suck in that gut.
BOBBY: How we doing, George?
I can't...I can't feel my legs.
And I think my ankle's broken.
HEN: Sir, you have any idea how long you've been down there?
I saw the sun come up.
Well, he's wedged in there pretty good.
How's your breathing?
I can't really take a deep breath.
Hey, George, can-can you show us how high up you can reach?
If we can drop you a line, we may be able to pull you up.
Okay.
HEN: Nice and slow, George.
BUCK: That's it.
(screams) Whoa, easy.
George, just...
keep hanging in there, we will get you out.
What are you thinking, Cap?
(knocking) Yes?
Ma'am, we need to access this unit.
Uh...
Let's go, start with the drill.
Uh, I'm in the middle of a private showing.
Hi.
(shouts) Oh, oh, oh, no!
(muffled): Help! Help!
A little high, boss. One second.
Someone get me out of here!
Sorry about that. One second.
That's your target.
(grunting) Why couldn't you go through the wall of the other building?
Ma'am, as I explained before, the wall in the other building is twice as thick.
It would take twice as much time.
And this is all gonna be taken care of.
Yeah. It's good to go, Cap.
All right, George, I'm-a need you to control your breathing and take shallow breaths.
(drill whirring) Let's get down there.
GEORGE: I think you should talk to me!
All right, we're almost there, George. How you holding up?
Uh, please hurry, 'cause...
I got to take a leak.
Okay, maybe hold off on that for a minute.
Okay, George, we're gonna start to pull you in here, but in order to do that, we're gonna have to pull on you pretty hard.
So you're probably gonna feel like you're falling, but you're not. If you start to panic and struggle, it's gonna be hard for us to get you in here. Do you understand?
Just don't dro...don't drop me, please.
I don't want to die.
Relax, everything's gonna be okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
All right?
All right, take a breath and just exhale. Ready?
GEORGE: Yeah.
One, two, three.
Start to pull.
Aah!
Here. Give me your hand. All right, you're safe.
(whimpering) All right.
Okay, you're home free, George. Watch your head. Okay.
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
HEN: All right, take it easy.
BOBBY: Okay, guys, on three: one, two, three.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
You're gonna be just fine. You're gonna be just fine, okay?
Okay...
Who knew having a gut was gonna save my life?
Captain?
Athena. Come on in.
Would you shut the door behind you?
You look worried.
Well, I'm not sure we've ever had a good conversation that started with "shut the door behind you." Well, then, this will be a first.
You applied for a promotion to lieutenant four times, but then you stopped applying.
Why?
I was passed over...four times.
When I pressed the issue, I was told that, um, I didn't have the necessary leadership qualities for further advancement.
Conners, right?
Mm-hmm.
Spent the entire conversation staring at your chest?
I never understood what that was about.
Was it a sexual thing, or was he just constantly surprised that there were police officers who had breasts?
Well, he was a real son of a bitch.
Ugh.
May he rest in peace.
Conners was wrong about, well, everything, but specifically, about your leadership skills.
You're tough, but fair.
Well-respected with the officers under your command.
And I think you would make an excellent lieutenant.
Thank you, Captain. Um, but I haven't even thought about applying in years.
Maybe next year.
How about next week?
There's an opening in Northeast Division.
I'd like to recommend you for it.
It'd be on an interim basis while we backfill the usual procedures.
That fast?
We're shorthanded.
Recruitment is down and retirement is up.
The command structure's been hollowed out in the middle.
Well, that's, uh, a lot to think about.
Uh, can I have some time with it?
Yeah. Take a few days.
It's yours if you want it, Athena.
But if you don't, that's okay.
Either way, at least this time, it's your decision.
All right, bud.
Dad's running a little behind.
(grunting): Ah, come on.
Eddito.
EDDIE: Morning, Abuela.
Eddie. Help him out.
EDDIE: He wants to do it.
Hola, mi angel.
Hola.
Thank you for taking him.
Taking him is not a problem.
Giving him back -- that's the hard part.
Okay.
Edmundo.
Ah.
Where's the fire?
(laughs) (speaks Spanish) That's better. Now go to work.
Okay.
Okay. Mwah.
Later, buddy.
(speaking Spanish) WOMAN: Who like mimosas?!
Hi, 911. This is Tanya.
Hi, Tanya, this is Maddie, and this line is reserved for emergencies.
(laughing): No, I totally have an emergency.
I'm sorry. My friend is just laughing, and it's making me laugh, and...
Okay, I'm fine now, for real.
So, anyway, we're at Saddle Ranch on Sunset, and my friend just got her head stuck in a pipe.
What kind of pipe?
It's, like, metal, I think.
Is it a drainpipe, or a sewer?
TANYA: A sewer?
God, no. It's attached to this guy's truck.
You mean a tailpipe?
Yeah! That.
(siren wailing, horn honking) * On a lightning raid * Just like a river runs Grab a creeper and some blocks.
She's over here.
* Like a fire needs flame, oh Holy crap, you are hot.
(people cheering) * I gotta feel it * In my blood...
Okay, guys, the strippers are here.
BUCK: Excuse me, coming through.
BOBBY: All right, ladies, just give us some space. Thank you.
Excuse me, clear a path. Coming through, thank you, thank you...thank you.
CHIMNEY: Hi, what's her name?
Betty.
(muffled): Jennifer.
Sorry, I thought you meant my truck.
This is your truck?
Yeah, but it's not like I backed into her.
She did this out of her own free will.
You dared her to.
We were flirting.
Your idea of flirting with a girl is daring her to stick her head in your tailpipe?
Oh, man.
CHIMNEY: Hi, Jennifer. LAFD.
How you feeling?
Uh, pretty good, actually.
Except for this whole, you know, ginormous tailpipe on my head.
HEN: Hey, Jennifer, you're gonna feel me poking around.
We're just checking you out, okay?
All right.
Why is this tailpipe so large?
BRENT: It's custom.
Where'd she get these bruises on her arm?
That wasn't me.
It's from the bull.
She rode it, like, five times.
There's no way we're gonna get a collar on her.
I got it.
Get me out of this thing.
These things are meant to increase the power to the engine.
Yup.
TSA 230 saw should do the job.
Oh, yeah, like a knife through butter.
Chim?
Excuse me. Way ahead of you, Cap.
BRENT: What?!
No, I spent 1,200 bucks on that tailpipe.
You might want to close your eyes during this part.
Just type your number in my phone, and I'll text you so you have mine.
BUCK: Thanks, but I actually have a girlfriend, and I need to focus right now so my captain doesn't cut your friend's head off.
Hi. Do you have Snapchat?
No. And, uh, I don't think I'm what you're looking for.
I have...I have a son.
That's great. So do I.
JENNIFER: I think I'm gonna puke.
You better not.
These fire guys are totally hot.
All right, what say we move the peanut gallery a few steps over this way. Thank you.
Everybody back a little bit, thank you.
HEN: All right, Jennifer, keep your head completely still.
You're gonna hear a lot of noise, but everything is fine.
(saw whirring, grinding) JENNIFER: (squeals) What are you doing?!
BOBBY: All right, almost there.
HEN: Okay.
Easy.
BUCK: We need lube.
I have some.
Clutch.
EDDIE: Slowly. Slowly.
(applause) Wow, you really are hot.
Would you like us to transport you to the hospital, get checked out?
She just needs another drink.
No, what she needs to do is go home.
All three of you do, in a cab.
Listen to me. When you sober up, you feel like you have a headache or blurry vision, or you feel confused, you got to get yourself to a hospital, you understand?
(giggling) HEN: Condolences on Betty.
DARLENE: Are you okay?
JENNIFER: Actually, yeah.
Hey, so is your son really the reason you don't date?
That, and...they weren't my type.
Not mine either. Not anymore.
But I'm talking in general.
It's complicated when you have a kid.
Come on, that's a weak excuse.
You live in your invisible girlfriend's house, and you're telling me about weak excuses.
(mutters) (phone vibrating) Hello?
What?
Which one?
(indistinct announcement on P. A.) My aunt.
Tía. ¿Qué pasó? Is Christopher okay?
(sighs) Yes.
You mean Prince Charming, hmm? He's peachy.
(woman laughing) It's your abuela. She broke her hip.
What? How?
She was out back on the steps and calling him to come inside.
She lost her balance.
Christopher called 911.
The rescue got there really quick.
I want to see her.
No, she's sleeping now.
And, uh, who is this?
This is Buck. We work together.
Mm. I thought you just dressed alike.
This is my Aunt Josefina. Pepa.
Hi.
You can't keep doing this, Eddie.
You cannot keep leaving him with her.
She's not up to it.
I know. I know, and I'm sorry.
I...I'm trying to find some permanent help, it's just...
too many forms to fill out. It's worse than the V. A.
I can't believe your gringa ex stuck you with all of this.
I'm not stuck, Tia.
Do you have to go back to work?
Ah. And you're not stuck.
I'll keep him tonight, but you need to get this figured out.
Daddy. (laughs) Buddy.
Hey...
(grunts) (laughs) BUCK: Must be rough.
Raising any child alone is rough.
My nephew is a saint.
But I pray for him anyway.
(door opens) Hey.
Hey.
You guys have fun at your dad's?
Yeah.
It was fun.
We got you these on the way back.
Oh!
Thanks, baby. (laughs) Uh, but what's the occasion?
For your promotion.
Congratulations. It's about time.
Yes, it is. And we are so proud of you.
Thanks, but I haven't taken the job.
I'm still thinking about it.
What is there to think about?
You've been wanting this forever.
Why don't you guys go and put your stuff away.
Okay.
Okay, I don't get it.
I thought that you would be more excited about this.
Hell, I thought that you would be celebrating.
All these years -- the long hours, extra shifts.
You fighting to get recognized.
Athena, you work so hard, why are you not enjoying this moment?
I don't know. Maybe I'm just too tired.
All that fighting takes its toll.
When I joined the force, I was young and ambitious.
Enthusiastic.
It's just...(sighs) I keep thinking of the twentysomething me.
Her dreams, her goals.
She had a vision of what success looked like.
It was all about stars and bars, climbing up the ladder, blowing through that glass ceiling.
I don't need that anymore.
Success is now about...
those kids, this family.
People in my life who love me.
People out there who count on me.
I am finally in a place where I'm comfortable in my life and in my own skin.
I don't know if I want to upend that for a pay bump.
Oh. Oh, this...
this is not about a paycheck.
It's the recognition for all of your hard work.
Yeah, yeah, you're in a comfortable spot.
That doesn't mean that you should get stuck there forever.
Take a risk.
The next place might be better.
I do this too much?
We all agree, believe me.
(laughter) Christopher, I thought we were buddies -- what happened?
What's this?
I don't remember asking the chief for reinforcements.
You any good with a hose, kid?
I can try.
All right.
So sorry, Cap.
My aunt's trying to get off work early, but until then, I...I didn't know where to take him.
Yeah, you did. Right here. Buck gave me a heads-up. I already cleared it with the chief.
(alarm ringing) MAN (over P. A.): Attention, station...
All right, let's go, let's go!
All right, buddy.
Okay.
PD is on the scene with a possible entrapment.
(laughing) These are great, see, 'cause we can talk to each other.
Though sometimes I wish I had a mute button for Buck.
(truck horn honks) Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something?
* Something ain't right, I'm so scared...* You have a scar on your head.
That's very observant, kid.
I had an accident.
Got a big metal rod stuck in my head, but the doctor took care of it.
You ever have surgery?
Two times.
Actually, three times.
Well, you got me beat.
Now I feel kind of lame.
Because you are.
(laughing) Your dad ever tell you why we call him Chimney?
No.
No. No, no, no, no.
I'll tell you the story later.
(car alarm blaring) * Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right...* Hey, can you grab the Jaws?
Now, you see, her air bags went off, so that protected her.
She's gonna be fine. You know what happens sometimes?
CHRISTOPHER: People get stuck.
BOBBY: That's right, people get stuck.
But we have a tool called the Jaws of Life.
And that's what your dad's gonna use right now.
Thanks to him, she's gonna make it home for dinner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
* Please...
All right, Christopher, come on over here. Ready?
Nice.
Christopher, here we go. Here we go.
Good job. Look at that. You're doing it.
Did you get a bonus already? Look at how good you are.
You're a natural.
* And I can see it makes no sense at all * (growls) * Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor...* What do you think? Is it good?
Yeah.
EDDIE: Come down, bud.
One more firefighter. Look at that! Yay!
(all cheering) Whoa.
CHIMNEY: Good job.
You nailed it, kid. (laughs) All right, fun's over.
Aw...
Bye, Christopher.
Later, Christopher.
Bye, Christopher.
Bye.
HEN: See you next time.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye.
EDDIE: Come on, bud.
Good job today, kiddo.
You, too, Cap.
(chuckling) Hola, mi amor. Okay, vamanos.
See you later.
PEPA: Okay. Did you have fun?
Be careful there, baby.
Thanks, Cap.
I just feel bad for him, you know?
Eddie, I mean. Not Christopher.
Christopher's great. He's smart, adorable, funny, in a kid way.
He just needs a little extra help.
Cerebral palsy, right?
Aunt Pepa said he got stuck in the birth canal. There were some complications, and then...
Well, did Aunt Pepa explain what's happening with the child care situation?
Because there are programs.
Eddie's working on it. He's got insurance.
And there's other stuff through the city, state and county, but the requirements are all different.
You can apply for one, and it can disqualify you from another.
It's a whole, giant bureaucratic mess.
I-I can't get my head around it.
I was a nurse, remember? The only people who truly navigate a bureaucracy are the people who work inside it.
It shouldn't be that way, though -- Eddie, always wondering how to take care of Christopher, and Christopher feeling like a burden on his dad.
Eddie doesn't feel that way, does he?
Not even a little.
He, uh, loves that kid like crazy.
He's a really great dad.
So, does this boy crush on Eddie mean that you're finally ready to, uh, move on from Abby?
That's cute.
I have some news.
I found an apartment. It's not far from work.
Two bedrooms, secure building.
Parking included.
So you're really moving out?
I told you that I wasn't gonna be able to live here forever.
Look, when I left Doug, I didn't have a plan.
I just grabbed up all my stuff and ran as fast and as far as I possibly could, but then you convinced me to start over, make a brand new life in L. A.
I was right about that.
You were.
But it's just not gonna feel like mine unless I'm standing on my own two feet.
That's the only way I'm gonna know it's real.
MRI TECH: You ready, Mr. Han?
No matter how many times I do this, I hate being stuck in this thing.
Yeah.
Try not to move your head.
It's extraordinary -- to think that just ten months ago you had that stuck through your skull.
As always, your bedside manner totally sucks, doc.
(laughs) I-I apologize, it's...
34 years in neurology, I have never seen anything like it.
You're a modern medical miracle.
Yeah?
Uh, to be honest, I still don't remember much of it.
Well, as we've discussed, some amnesia around such a traumatic event -- it's to be expected.
Did we discuss that?
I'm just joking.
All right, so how we looking?
Excellent.
As you can see, no sign of traumatic brain injury.
You're exactly where you were two months ago.
Fantastic.
Tatiana?
Hi, Chimney.
You doing the math in your head?
No.
Uh, yes.
Don't worry, unless this is the longest-incubated baby in human history, she's my husband's.
Oh.
So, you're married, too?
Yeah.
I'm glad that I ran into you.
I've been wanting to call, but what do you say?
"Sorry that I was so awful and broke up with you "without even calling when you were laid up in the hospital with a metal pipe in your head?" Yes, those words exactly, actually.
Except it was rebar, not a pipe.
Everything else okay, I mean, like, on the inside?
Yeah, just got another clean bill of health.
I'm a miracle.
In more ways than one.
That whole experience woke me up, not just to how fragile life is, but to the kind of person that I was.
So I went to that clinic up north where you spend ten days looking at your life, tearing apart your personality, and figuring it all out.
I'm very happy for you.
No, you're not.
Which is fair.
How's your life? I mean, anyone special?
Uh...not at the moment, no.
But I did a firefighter calendar.
I'm Mr. April.
Oh.
That's great.
Send me one if you want.
(elevator bell dings) I'll wait for the next one.
MORRIS (muffled): Help! Help!
It's hot in here!
I do not give my consent to use my face on whatever show this is.
Okay, ma'am, it sounds like you should be calling your bank.
WOMAN: It told me to call 911.
I'm sorry?
A note came out of the thingy.
It says someone's stuck inside.
I know it sounds crazy, but I think I can hear someone yelling from in there.
Inside the machine? Are you sure?
I'm sure I don't have my money.
BUCK: The only way she knows it's real is for her to live in a two-bedroom apartment in Eagle Rock.
What does that even mean?
I think it means she's not comfortable squatting in some stranger's condo.
Abby's not a stranger.
Hi.
Hi.
HEN: So she has a new life. Great. So do you.
No, that's the point. I don't have a new life.
I have the same life.
You should be grateful. You almost died, Chim.
Exactly: I almost died and I didn't.
I had a life-altering trauma, and her life got altered.
All I got was the trauma.
Welded hinges.
Yup.
Bank said they sent a technician out this morning to replace the lock on the vault.
Found his van in the lot.
Cell phone was in the passenger seat.
Best guess is he got locked inside the vault with no way to call out.
Help!
BUCK: Sir, we're gonna get you out of there.
Help! Can you hear me?!
Oh. There he is.
HEN: Did you expect her to wait?
How about at least until I came out of my coma?
And by the looks of her belly, I'm pretty sure she was getting busy while that rebar was still in my head.
I just feel like it's all happening too fast.
I mean, how many years did it take her before she was ready to leave Doug?
That hardly feels like the same thing.
My point is she just got here and now she's leaving again.
Buck, she's moving to Eagle Rock, not Alaska.
It's ten minutes from your place. Abby's place.
Your sister's building a new life for herself.
Be proud of her.
I should be happy for her, right?
She did apologize, not just for how it ended, but before, too.
She said she felt like maybe she had been a bitch.
She's not lying. She was a bitch.
What? You're my friend. She's your ex.
You get to forgive and move on.
I get to hold a grudge until I die.
You think it's weird I still live in Abby's place?
Yes.
Me, too. Don't tell anyone.
It was fine at first, you know? She was just gonna be gone for a few months and I wanted to be supportive, but she still hasn't come back and I don't know what to do.
I'm just...
Stuck. That's how I feel.
I almost died and my life is exactly the same as it was before.
It's not like I woke up out of a coma and, suddenly, I know how to play the piano or speak a foreign language.
Chimney, I think you're setting your expectations too high.
No, I think I'm setting them too low.
We hardly ever even talk, you know?
It's always time zone issues or cell phone problems.
Did you know she's been in Morocco over a week?
(Morris shouting inside) No, I did not know that.
No, me neither.
Found out yesterday on Instagram.
(grunts) I still love Abby, and I want her to be happy.
How long do I have to wait before I get to be happy, too?
(grunts): Got it.
All right, we got it.
Step back. Ready?
I don't know this Abby person, but I've never been happier to see anyone in my life.
You like the classics, don't you?
I'm sorry?
Your eye is drawn to the more traditional, classic setting.
This one here.
It's our most popular engagement ring, and with good reason. Would you like to see it?
No. (stammers) No, no thank you.
But, uh, you could show me the box it comes in.
Excuse me? You-you want to see the box?
Yeah, uh, I already, uh...(chuckles) I already have the-the ring.
I'm not crazy, I-I-I promise.
My girlfriend -- my soon to be fiancé...(chuckles) I hope -- a few months after we met, I-I bought her an expensive diamond necklace from this very store.
Oh, nice.
Yeah.
And she pawned it.
Then donated the money to an animal shelter.
Isn't that...sweet.
So, I-I kind of just-just want the box, if-if that's okay?
Sure.
Seriously? You still haven't left yet?
Daniel, I have to be back at work in an hour.
DANIEL: Ariel, turn around.
Ariel Simone...
(Ariel gasps) I love you to the moon and back.
Will you marry me?
(laughing): Yes! Of course I'll...
Daniel!
(screaming) BOBBY: LAFD, coming through.
Hey, I guess they'd been working on the escalator overnight.
The floor panel on the landing -- it must not have been put back securely.
Daniel, help is here.
The fire department is here.
Please tell me he's gonna be okay. Please help him.
We're gonna do everything we can, okay? We're...
They're gonna it over from here. What's his name?
It's Daniel.
Hey, Daniel, can you hear me?
We got to get this step out of here.
BUCK: One, two, three.
BOBBY: All right, Chim, you're on.
* Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies * I got a pulse, guys.
Oh, thank God!
Daniel, can you hear me?
Ariel...No, I need to see her for...Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, buddy.
(moaning) I need you to stay very still, okay?
But I want you to keep talking to me.
I was, uh...
proposing to-to my girl.
All right, talk to me, Chim. What do you got?
It's not good.
What's happening? Why are you stopping?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
The chain is sitting on top of his femoral artery.
It's possible it's even nicked it.
Loosening might make it worse.
Tension's acting as a tourniquet, could be keeping him from bleeding out.
All right, let's get him out of there. Chim, tie him off.
Hen, get an I. V., run it wide open.
Copy that.
* But if love is enough (grunting) * Could you let it show * Let it show *
* If you feel it, could you...
Clipping the wires and chain.
(chain snaps) Aah! (moaning) CHIMNEY: I know it hurts, just relax, let me get you out of here.
Daniel!
Okay, try to relax, try to breathe.
We're gonna get you out of here.
DANIEL: Oh, God! Aah!
(screams) Try to relax, try to relax.
I'm gonna get you out of here, all right? I know it hurts, just relax. We're gonna get you out of here.
(Daniel moaning) CHIMNEY: Okay, on three.
One, two...three!
(screams) See? He's coming out, he's coming out. It's all right.
I'm gonna help, okay?
Here, I got him, I got him.
* But if love * Is enough could you let it show *
* Let it show * (applause) * If you feel it, could you let me know * What did she say?
* If you feel it, could you let me know? * I think she said yes, buddy.
(coughs) * For a miracle.
Blood pressure's dropping.
Breathing is shallow.
Daniel, can you hear me?
I can't find a pulse.
He's in cardiac arrest. One...
Daniel? Oh, please, God.
Ma'am, you have to stand back. Let them do their job, okay?
(monitor slowly beeping) (flatline) Chim.
He's gone.
* (crying) Daniel...
(sobbing) * You all right?
No, I don't know, uh, that I am.
(sighs) I lived, Cap.
(sniffles) I'm alive.
Yeah, you are.
Why?
How come I survived and that poor guy back there didn't?
I mean...
his life was about to change, right?
He had so much to live for.
So do you.
Do I?
Something happened to me that was supposed to be life-changing, and nothing changed.
It's like everything just stopped.
I feel like I died that night.
I mean, I just keep replaying everything in my head, all those moments on the freeway -- the look on your face, being wheeled into the ER...
I thought you didn't remember any of that.
I remember it all.
(sniffles) Everything.
Wakes me up in the middle of the night. I just can't...
You kept telling everybody that you had no memory of it.
I know.
Why?
I don't know, I just...
I guess it's easier to not talk about it, but it's always there on my mind, I just...I don't want to recount it as some sort of freak show form of en...entertainment.
I just want it to go away, it's...
You know, Chim...a life-changing event can't change your life if you keep pretending it didn't happen.
You got to talk about it, man, you got to let it out, process it.
You feel like you're still trapped in that car, don't you?
Sitting helpless on that freeway.
Well, you're not on that freeway, and you're not helpless, Chim.
You're right here, pal.
So are all the people who love you.
All right.
Come here.
(sniffles) Thought you said we were helping your sister move.
Doesn't look like she's packed anything.
Oh, this stuff is Abby's.
I lied about the whole moving thing.
I mean, my sister is moving, it's just...
she doesn't really have that much stuff.
What's going on, Buck?
I asked you here 'cause there's someone I want you to meet.
You didn't set me up, did you?
No, just-just trust me.
This woman is...exactly what you need.
(knocking) She's here.
Buckaroo!
(laughs) Carla. (chuckles) Baby...Ah! Goodness, I missed your face.
BUCK (laughs): Oh, I missed you, too. Come on in.
Uh, Eddie, this-this is my friend Carla.
Nice to meet you, Eddie.
Likewise.
Carla is L. A.'s finest home health care aid.
She has years of experience navigating giant bureaucracies, and I thought she could help you figure out how to get Christopher what he needs.
I'm red tape's worst nightmare.
(laughs) I'll get you through this in no time.
Now, let's go sit down and let's see what you're working with.
Besides that perfect bone structure.
Hi. I'm actually looking for somebody.
Hi.
Seeing you the other day really threw me.
I spent months thinking about what I wanted to say to you.
And then you were there, and...
and my mind just went blank.
I just...I didn't know what to say, so...
I get it. That's why I'm here.
So, whatever you need to say, I'm-I'm ready to hear it.
Thank you.
I-I'm glad that you didn't pretend with me after my accident.
It's not what either us needed.
You see, all I did was pretend with you the entire time we were together, just...
pretending to be something that I wasn't.
Uh, telling you stories of things that I had never done, adventures that I'd never had.
Why?
I guess I always thought that being just me wasn't enough.
(chuckles) It's enough.
It's more than enough.
Thanks. (chuckles) Here.
(mouths) (chuckles) It's for the baby.
I figured.
That's cute.
And this...
is for you.
(laughs): Wow.
Very nice.
I really want you to have a blessed life, Tatiana.
I want the same for you.
Well, I guess I'll just have to do that, then, huh?
What's going on?
I can hear you thinking.
This about the promotion?
I have to give Maynard my decision before my shift starts.
You're worried she's gonna think less of you when you turn it down?
How did you know I'm turning it down?
Everyone else I've told assumes, of course, I'm taking it.
I'd be crazy not to.
I don't think it's crazy to be happy with what you have.
To feel satisfied it's enough.
Is it enough?
I like being out there, seeing with my own eyes what's really going on in the world, doing my job, helping where I can.
then coming home at the end of the day and letting it all go.
Know what I mean?
Hey, I became a firefighter 'cause I didn't want to be behind a desk.
In the truck, with my team -- that's what I want for as long as they'll let me have it.
There's nothing wrong with that.
No, there isn't.
You think you can sleep now?
(chuckles) Maybe not just yet.
MADDIE: We all get stuck from time to time.
In our circumstances, in our fear, stuck on a page we haven't yet been able to turn.
So this is really everything, huh?
Yeah. Unless you want to give me some of Abby's dishes.
I'll accumulate stuff. That's part of starting over.
And when we're feeling stuck, or even just a little too comfortable, if we're very lucky, someone will be there...
(indistinct chatter) (chuckles) (gasps) Hola, mi amor.
All right.
Hi. (speaks Spanish) Oh, who is that? Who is that?
MADDIE: ...to give us a little push.
Or a kick in the pants.
Or just offer a hand...
(speaking Spanish) ...to help us get unstuck.
@@@@@@
Right in here.
Thanks, guys.
(car alarm chirps) (engine starts) (Lorraine screams) Oh!
(Lorraine groaning) Oh, my leg, my leg.
I think it's broken.
Oh, my God, where did you come from?
Sherman Oaks.
Ow!
No.
No, I-I mean, are you okay?
You just hit me with your car! Of course I'm not okay.
That's a really, really nice car.
Is that a custom paint job?
(groans): Oh, really hurts when I move my head.
Is that normal?
(screams): Ow!
* She works hard for the money * So hard for it, honey * She works hard for the money * So you better treat her right *
* She works hard for the money * So hard for it, honey * She works hard for the money * So you better treat her right *
* I met her there (screams) * And she wonders where she is * And it's strange to her * Some people seem to have everything *
* 9:00 a. m. on the hour hand * And she's waiting for the bell *
* And she's looking real pretty *
* She's waiting for her clientele *
* She works hard for the money * So hard for it, honey * She works hard for the money * So you better treat her right. * (Lorraine yelps) (siren wailing, horn honks) LAFD. Step aside, please.
I didn't know what to do.
I was afraid to move the car.
You did the right thing. We'll take it from here.
Do any of you have a pen?
I've got a partial license plate.
Somebody should write it down.
EDDIE: Don't worry about the license plate, ma'am.
It's right here on the back of the car.
Not this car.
The car that hit me.
Uh, wait, this isn't the car that hit you?
No, this is the car that ran me over.
(groans) Better be insured.
Let's just focus on getting you out of here first, ma'am.
BUCK: I think there's enough room. We can slide a backboard under here and pull her out that way.
Okay, c-can you tell me your name?
Lorraine.
(grunts) Hey, wait. Don't we know you?
LORRAINE: Uh, no, I don't...I don't, I don't think so.
HEN: Last year, Hancock Park.
That's right. I never forget a femur.
Hmm.
(chuckles nervously) It's the damned Porch Pirate.
(moans) Guess you moved up from porches to parking lots, huh, Lorraine?
What's your scam?
I don't know what you are talking about.
I went to my court-mandated treatment. I'm completely cured.
Haven't stole a package in months.
Mm-hmm. I heard you settled with that homeowner.
The house she fell in front of when she was package stealing?
I didn't realize you could sue someone for being injured during the commission of a felony.
Pled down to a misdemeanor.
Insurance companies are happy to settle instead of going to court.
Insurance companies are less happy about fraud.
And I got three witnesses who claim you intentionally stepped out behind that poor woman's car.
Makes me wonder what I might find when I pull the security footage from this parking lot.
I think you'll find a woman suffering with mobility issues.
Lot of trouble walking since that fall on the steps.
You know, I wonder if it's because I received improper care on the scene.
(laughs) So you're gonna sue us now?
Oh, you folks are city employees.
Probably don't make that much.
But the city...
There's probably some deep pockets there, don't you think? (moans) Awful woman.
WOMAN (over phone): Isn't it your job to help?
I mean, are you even listening to what I'm saying?
I gave you the address. What else do you need?
Okay, ma'am, if you could just calm down and give me some information.
WOMAN: Are you deaf? You keep asking the same stupid questions, and I keep telling you: I don't know.
Does he have a pulse?
WOMAN: I'm not touching him, lady.
Do you know where he's been injured?
I need a damn ambulance!
Okay.
The ambulance is on the way. If you could just tell me...
WOMAN: Why didn't you say that, you stupid bitch?
Wasting my time.
(dial tone) (groans) (sighs) This'll make you feel better.
Delicious and Paleo.
You made Paleo muffins?
I can barely make lunch. Although I should start, 'cause Jim in the food truck is getting the wrong idea.
So, what's your secret?
Dee's Bakery on Larchmont, but don't tell anyone.
Bad call?
Bad day.
It's like the whole city's in a mood.
That's every day, honey.
There are over 200 languages spoken in the city of Los Angeles, and I've been cursed out in every single one of them.
It's not like I've never been yelled at before.
I mean, I worked in an ER, but...
it just felt different somehow.
You know, maybe it's because I could see them.
I could see that they were scared or in pain, that they didn't mean to be so...
Awful?
Does it ever get to you?
Oh.
I've been doing this for 20 years.
At some point, it gets to everyone.
My Stan always used to say, "Can't bring those people home with you, Gloria.
They'll wear you down." I never realized how right he was until after he was gone.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
I'm told he's in a better place now.
But the thing I learned is that there's no controlling someone else's behavior.
But how you react to it, that's on you.
No, it's just hard not to take it personally sometimes.
You said you felt different when you could see their faces, right?
Maybe that's what you need.
How? I mean, the system isn't exactly set up for FaceTime.
Go on a ride-along.
In a police car?
It should be part of your training, anyway.
You've heard them on the phone, and you've been there when they were wheeled into the ER.
Now get out and see what happens in between.
(watch beeps) Oh.
Well, time to save the world.
Josh.
Morning, Gloria.
Wow, she really has it all figured out.
She's this place's Céline Dion.
(chuckles) No bull. Just here every day, getting on that stage and giving it her all.
("Gloria" by Them playing) (phone ringing) 911. What is your emergency?
WOMAN: Help, please.
My boyfriend's bleeding. He shot himself with one of those nail guns.
What's your location?
9534 Sycamore. Mount Washington.
Help is on the way.
Do you have a clean cloth you can apply to the wound?
911. What is your emergency?
MAN: Hi. Yeah, I-I think someone is breaking in to the house next door.
Okay, do you see anyone?
No. I-I heard some glass break.
So you're calling because you heard glass breaking?
MAN: What? No. Well, I mean...
I don't know. My neighbors are in Florida.
Can you please just send someone to check it out?
I'd say the real crime is being in Florida at this time of year.
Try calling a window repairman.
911. What's your emergency?
MAN 2: I'm sitting in a coffee shop, and this guy just ran up, grabbed my brand-new bike and took off.
Did he break your legs first?
What? No. What?
Go chase him and get it back.
* G-L-O-R-I-A How long ago did the pain start?
It's probably gas.
CPR? No, I wouldn't bother.
Well, maybe you should have made better life choices.
Sir, I think this amount of crying is a little over the top and unproductive, don't you think?
If you were really going to jump, I doubt you'd be calling me.
(sighs) Gloria, I think you've earned yourself an extra muffin.
Right there.
Athena Grant?
One and only.
Hi, I'm...
Maddie Kendall.
New dispatcher here for your ride-along.
You requested me.
(chuckles) No one ever requests me.
We have someone in common. Kendall's my married name.
I actually used to be Maddie Buckley.
I am again.
Oh, Buckley. You're Buck's sister.
Yeah, ER nurse from Philly.
Hershey. How did you know that?
Oh, Bobby -- uh, Captain Nash -- said that Buck had a sister who was new to town.
Your brother's boss is my boo.
(chuckles) Yeah.
Your brother and I got off on the wrong foot, but, uh, he's grown on me.
Kid's got a heart of gold.
So, I don't have to call you Buck-ette or anything, do I?
(laughs): No, Maddie is fine.
So, how you liking it so far? L. A.
Well, the traffic has exceeded my expectations, and I experienced my first earthquake.
(chuckles) A 7.1, girl.
You're an official Angeleno now.
(indistinct radio chatter) So, you don't have a partner?
Field sergeant.
I go where I want or where I'm needed.
I feel like that's what I'm doing, too.
Or, at least, I hope it is.
Was it bad?
You said your married name was Kendall. You come here to start over?
It was awful.
But I'm not ashamed to talk about it.
I mean, I was.
Now I realize how strong I am for getting out.
The day that every woman in the world realizes how strong she really is is the day that will bring peace on Earth.
DISPATCHER: All Wilshire Division units.
Please respond to a 415 group at Parkview Cemetery.
Request supervisor on scene.
727-L-30. En route.
415. Disturbance?
Yeah. My guess, another military funeral protest.
What kind of people would protest a military funeral?
(siren wailing) * PROTESTORS: Burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Why don't you have some respect?
God is not a respecter of perverts!
Yeah, well, you're not God, are you?
No, and neither are you.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
I'm not ashamed!
Take all of yourselves home.
You -- No, you can go home.
PROTESTORS: ...burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Hey, should I stay in the car?
Yeah, stay there.
Coming through. Coming through.
Coming thr...coming through.
Coming through.
Two, four, six, eight...
Officer, can you please, please do something about this?
My-my sister's trying to bury her son.
I understand. And I'm very sorry for your loss, but my best advice is just to ignore them.
Are you kidding me?
They've got bullhorns.
This is a funeral.
Do you see those disgusting signs?
I see 'em, but as long as they stay behind that fence, it's their constitutionally protected right to stand there and be awful.
My nephew volunteered to serve because he believed in protecting the freedom that gives these...
these idiots the right to spew their filth.
I'll do what I can.
(fence rattles) Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Okay, sir, you need to stay behind the fence.
Or what?
Or your next stop will be county jail.
Where your black brothers have been duly incarcerated.
(protestors continue chanting) Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
Back it up. I'm not gonna tell you again.
Well, can I just back up, or do I have to pay repar...ations? (coughing) All right, folks, take it back.
Take it behind the fence. Sir...
(choking) Sir? Sir?
Get your hands off me.
Get 'em off. (groaning) 727-L-30, requesting R. A. unit at Parkview Cemetery.
(sirens wailing) Sergeant Grant.
Captain. Mr. Personality over here starting coughing, grabbed his side and fell over.
Could be appendicitis. I'm not sure.
All right, back up.
Step aside, please.
Sir, I'm just gonna examine you for a second here.
Oh. Okay, we got a colostomy bag, probably backing up.
You're gonna have to intubate him. Sir, just try to relax.
These paramedics here are gonna attend to you.
(Scooter groaning) Oh, hell no.
You do it.
BOBBY: Sir, I am not a trained paramedic.
I can't intubate you. They can.
(weakly): I'm fine.
CHIMNEY: Sir, you're not fine.
Your bowel is probably obstructed.
The contents of your colostomy bag are backing up into your system.
You're about to choke on your own waste.
You will suffocate and die.
Get...away.
BOBBY: Okay, sir, if you refuse care, we cannot administer it by force.
SCOOTER (groans): What about him?
"Diaz." Diaz.
What kind of name is that?
My father's from Mexico.
My mother's Swedish. I can help you out with the Swedish half.
But no one told me which half that is.
Okay, would you like me to call you another paramedic team so you can have an all-white one?
Yeah.
He's gonna aspirate.
(retching) And he's aspirating.
Actual diarrhea of the mouth.
Outstanding.
Okay, guys, let's get to work.
Let me roll him over.
Ready, Buck?
Yeah.
Three, two, one.
(gagging) I need mechanical suction.
This isn't cutting it.
We've got suction on the truck.
Let's get him on the gurney. Let's go.
Keep him on his side.
Let's go.
We'll bring the gurney on the other side.
One, two, three, go.
(engine starts) Well done.
Right, your ride-along was today. Uh, Cap, this is my sister Maddie.
Great to finally meet you.
Yeah, you, too. I've heard nothing but wonderful things about you.
Well, don't believe everything your little brother tells you.
I meant from her.
Ah. Well, the feeling is mutual.
She's something. She never lets anything get to her.
Get to me? Do you know how many times in a given day somebody's got the opportunity to get to me?
(chuckles) If I start letting them get to me, I wouldn't make it past breakfast.
Which reminds me, we should eat.
Eat? You want to eat after that?
It's lunchtime.
(laughter) (engine starts) So, you like her?
Abby? Sure.
You don't approve? Is it the age difference?
More like the time difference. Part of me is impressed.
It's the longest relationship my little brother's ever had.
Ah, and the other part?
Can't help but notice she hasn't been here for most of it.
Whoa.
Huh. That's weird.
Hang tight for a second.
Yeah.
Police.
Anyone here?
(gun cocks) (liquid boiling, food sizzling) (loudly): Is anyone here?
(phone line beeping in distance) Sir, can you hear me?
(phone line continues beeping) Sir, can you tell me what happened?
(gasping): Robber. Shot.
727-L-30, requesting R. A. units and additional units at 12507 Wilshire.
Gunshot wound and apparent 211.
No description of the suspect at this time.
MAN (over radio): Copy that. Ten minutes out.
You said he was talking?
Yeah, he said a few words, then he passed out.
Sir? Can you hear me?
(scissors cutting) Uh, okay, um, I need something to seal this with.
The-the air is being pulled into his thoracic cavity instead of his lungs.
Uh, plastic wrap?
Perfect.
Here. Three pieces of tape.
Thanks.
Okay, lost his pulse. Moving to compressions.
Okay, you know what, I need the blood to keep flowing to his heart. Can you elevate his legs?
(gasps) (panting) You're gonna be okay, sir.
The ambulance is almost here.
(weakly): How you here?
They hang up.
ATHENA: Sir?
Who hung up on you?
911.
(phone line continues beeping) I still can't believe it. Who just hangs up?
I mean, if we hadn't been there, he would have died.
And you get a gold star for saving him, Nurse Nellie Forbush, but ten demerit points for jumping to conclusions.
He probably got disconnected. Spotty cell service or he hit a wrong button.
It happens. Sometimes people panic.
Fine.
Do you have the number he called from?
GLORIA (recorded): 911. What is your emergency?
LANH: Help! A robber. He shot me.
GLORIA: What? What did you say?
LANH: Ma Xun Restaurant on Wilshire.
Please, please help. Send help.
I can't understand you.
Speak louder or I'm hanging up.
It can't be her.
LANH: Shot. Bleeding. Help now.
GLORIA: Yelling at me won't stop the bleeding, okay?
I'm not the one who shot you.
(speaking Vietnamese) Seriously?
You're switching to another language now?
(clicks) That wasn't a mistake.
Gloria hung up on him.
Guys?
Careful! Guys, be easy with her.
She's not a puppy.
Hey, listen...
I am glad that Athena got someone new.
Okay? No, I am.
Y-You should have heard what Harry told me the other day.
He says, "Dad, doesn't it seem weird that you're an architect "and Bobby is a firefighter?
"I mean, you're there when the buildings go up, but he's there when it burns down to the ground." (laughter) KAREN: Wow.
Symbolism much?
Hey, you know, Bobby is a good man, and I think that's what makes it a little bit harder.
I mean, he has this natural paternal quality.
KAREN: Well, listen, you don't need to worry.
'Cause you are those babies' father, and they know it.
And anything they get from him is just extra.
Yeah, that's right. (laughs) (toy squeaks) (dog whining) Well, he's amazing. What's his name?
She's a she. Paisley.
My mama rescued her.
I bet she did.
HARRY: Um, where's your dog?
Son of a bitch.
Boys, boys. Let's go, let's go.
Hey, guys, come on. Who wants some food, huh?
You evil...
Excuse me?
What did you say to him?
You mean did I tell him I was his real mother?
Not yet.
You're not his real mother.
You signed away all rights to him the day he was born.
You're right, I signed away all my parental rights.
But he didn't.
Who the hell is he?
That's Nathaniel.
That's Denny's biological father.
He didn't even know he had a kid.
You told me you didn't know who the father was.
I lied.
You're lying now.
Am I?
We'll find out.
I'll see you in court.
(elevator bell dings) Hi. Now's not a good time.
Why don't you take a longer lunch?
What?
Oh, are they reprimanding her for hanging up?
Good.
No.
They're firing her for hang-ups.
Yeah, plural. Hundreds, maybe thousands, going back eight months.
Eight months?!
That last part makes sense.
She went a little squirrelly after the divorce.
Uh, I thought her husband was dead.
She only wishes he were.
She's probably facing criminal charges.
There's precedent.
911 dispatcher in Houston got 18 months for interfering with emergency calls.
(door opens) You! You traitor!
Talk later.
I was nice to you, I helped you.
I showed you where we hide the good coffee pods, and you betrayed me.
They want to put me in jail because of what you said!
You hung up on people on purpose.
Awful people!
People who yell and scream and cry and expect you to do something for them.
I mean, and do they ever say, "How are you?" Do they ever ask, "How are you doing, Gloria?" Do they ever think of anything but themselves and what they need? No!
You give them everything you have, and then they leave you for your sister! You know, Maddie, I'm...
Ma'am, it's time to go.
This...You can't just toss me into the trash!
I won "Outstanding Dispatcher" eight times.
(elevator bell dings) I took more calls than anyone.
Half of them were under 45 seconds.
GLORIA: This isn't over, Maddie!
Just mark my words. Snitches get stitches!
(dog whining) KAREN: But what does that mean for us?
What rights does that give him?
Here. Little man, take Paisley to your room.
(Karen speaks indistinctly) KAREN: Look...Hen just walked in.
Okay.
Thanks, Mark.
Never a good sign hearing from your lawyer after office hours.
Well, the lab report came back.
Nathaniel Green is Denny's biological father.
What does that mean?
It means...he has rights.
It means he could try to take our son away from us.
What does Mark say?
That we're screwed.
I mean, he used more lawyerly words.
Our case is more "challenging" now.
And, "The court will have to "balance the interests of the child against the birth mother's fraudulent acts." HEN: Okay. Okay, listen.
Let me talk to Athena.
There's got to be more to this guy's story.
Maybe she can do some digging, find out something that we can use against him.
All this just because that awful woman wanted to hurt you.
Why did you bring her back into our lives?
Karen, listen.
I was stupid.
Hmm.
I was selfish.
I was weak.
And I'm sorry. I'm so...so very sorry.
I know you're sorry...
and you never meant for any of this to happen.
I know that in my head, but the rest of me...
is having a really hard time.
Mama?
Mama sounded mad.
Yeah, Mommy just got some bad news tonight.
She's just upset.
She was really mad at the park when I talked to that lady.
Is she mad at me?
Mm-mm, not even a little bit.
Mommy and I love you more than anything.
Can you fix the bad thing like you fix people at work?
Yeah.
Don't you worry, little man.
Mama's gonna fix everything.
So she hangs up on a thousand people, and it's your fault she got fired?
Oh, not just fired.
The LAPD has launched an investigation.
She could go to jail, which I guess is also my fault, because I violated a code when I reported her.
I don't even know what that means.
Like, a 911 dispatcher code?
They say cops have that blue line.
Yeah, well, I wear maroon.
Anyway, she just kept texting and calling, so I had to shut my phone off.
(phone vibrating) Ugh. Guess who? Looks like Gloria's not done yelling at me.
BUCK: Want me to talk to her?
No, I just want to ignore her completely, and she'll go away eventually, I hope.
I can't smash another cell phone.
* (engine starts) (siren wailing in distance) (phone vibrating) Hey.
KAREN: Hey. Um...
I'm sorry about before.
This isn't your fault.
I'm just scared. (scoffs) Babe?
Yeah, I'm...
I'm scared, too.
Where are you?
HEN: Just out for a drive. I need to clear my head.
All I feel is rage, just boiling over in me.
Just come home, babe.
I love you.
HEN: I love you, too.
Eva?
Eva!
Open up the damn door! I know you're in there.
Eva!
(glass breaking) Eva?!
Damn it.
(gurgling) (gurgling continues) (line ringing) PARAMEDIC: That's it.
That's good. Okay, sit up for me.
(Eva groans) Lean against the wall there.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
(Eva sighs softly) No.
What the hell is she doing here?
PARAMEDIC: She called it in.
Saved your life.
That's because she loves me.
(Hen scoffs, laughs) I don't even hate you, Eva.
I feel nothing for you.
Then why were you here?
I called your parole officer.
He'll meet you at the hospital.
Good luck in prison.
You saved me, Hen!
I save awful people every day. It's my job.
Sergeant Grant. You're the one called it in?
I saw the bulletin you guys sent out about your robbery suspect.
Mm-hmm.
Patient just came in. White man in his 20s with untreated burns and a sketchy demeanor.
Yeah. Victim threw hot oil in his face.
I thought he might seek medical treatment.
This one said he did it grilling, but the burn pattern's all wrong.
Plus, the wounds are more than a day old.
He's got a massive infection and keeps screaming about the pain.
Well, let's see if we can't give him something to take his mind off that.
(knocks on door) Mr. Davis, can I come in?
(glass breaking) 727-L-30 requesting R. A. unit at Carthay Urgent Care, 2952 Carlson Avenue.
I have an unconscious suspect in need of medical attention.
You got him?
ATHENA (over phone): Yeah.
Owner got him good with that hot oil.
Burns were like a scarlet letter all over his face, except the "A" didn't stand for "adulterer" in this particular case.
MADDIE: What about the restaurant owner?
Out of ICU and on the mend.
Amazing.
Hey, thanks for letting me ride shotgun with you.
Sure.
Nothing like some blood and bile and bullets to help you see how special it is what you do on that phone every day.
MADDIE: First of all, I'm pretty sure that wasn't bile.
And second, it wasn't just the calls that we answered, it was you.
I mean, now if I have a moment of doubt, I can just say, "What would Athena do?" You're too kind. (laughs) I guess those golden hearts run in the Buckley family.
Take care, Buck-ette.
You, too, Sergeant.
(phone vibrates) Hello.
GLORIA (over phone): Maddie.
Glad I finally got you.
(sighs) Stop calling me.
Stop texting me.
Leave me alone.
GLORIA: But I have so much free time now.
I could call you all day.
MADDIE (over speaker): I mean, what do you want from me?
Do you want me to say that I'm sorry for turning you in for almost killing a man?
I'm not.
I tried to teach you something important.
Oh, here's a little something I learned.
(sighs) (dialing) (line ringing) This call is being recorded.
I think I might be having an actual emergency.
Unbelievable. How did you even...?
GLORIA: Get transferred to you directly?
This is Officer Donnelly.
513-Mary-12. Responding to a 207.
I've got an 11-58 and need to keep off the airwaves.
Can you patch me through to my dispatcher?
Who is Officer Donnelly?
I made her up. (laughs) Because I know the system, Maddie.
Until yesterday, I was the system.
But you took that from me.
Ma'am, it is against the law to call 911 for non-emergencies.
It's also a crime to impersonate a police officer.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to report this.
Don't you dare "ma'am" me or tell me about the law.
Your whole generation is nothing but a bunch of lazy ingrates.
You have no clue what it's like...(screams) (groaning) MADDIE: Gloria?
(Gloria groans) MADDIE: What just happened? Gloria?
Maddie?
Are you still there?
I think I was in an accident.
MADDIE: I-I'm here. Where are you?
(door thuds) (grunts softly) (moans) (whimpering): I can't get out.
I can't get out.
I'm stuck.
Why can't I hear you?
Gloria, I'm here.
Did you hang up?
I'm here. I don't think she can hear me.
God, I hope you didn't hang up.
The airbags probably deployed.
GLORIA: I mean...
She wouldn't be able to hear anything.
GLORIA: It's definitely what I would have done, but I hope you didn't do it.
Okay, so we'll have to do this the hard way.
Cell tower is giving me this radius, but I don't see any reports in the area.
SUE: Okay, here.
I have to call someone.
But I lost my phone.
MADDIE: Air Support, I need assistance getting a visual on a vehicle.
I really wish you were still on the line.
I wouldn't blame you if you hung up on me.
That's what I would have done.
I don't know why. That's a lie.
I do know why.
Dead-end calls.
Not sure if you've had one yet, but it's when you can hear everything that's happening on the other end of the line, and you know there's not gonna be anything that you can do.
Except sit there and listen to someone die.
(sighs) It happened to me.
Stan had served me with papers that morning, and I, and I got a call from this girl.
She was hiding under a desk because...
a client came in with a gun.
I could hear the shots -- one, then another.
Getting closer.
(crying): I knew what was coming, so I...
I just, I...
I hung up.
And I-I felt so relieved.
She wasn't my problem anymore.
After that, nothing was my problem.
Until you.
You're gonna be okay, Gloria.
Since I'm making my peace, I...
I don't know if I should...
apologize to you or...
or forgive you, but I should do more...
(horn honking) You didn't hang up.
You didn't.
No.
You're here.
I'm still here.
(sighs) He's a straight arrow.
Owns his own home.
Stable job.
Manager at Home Depot.
Employee of the month three times.
Yeah, good credit.
And he counsels at-risk kids on the weekends.
Oh, you got to be joking me.
How are we gonna win against this guy?
He's freaking perfect.
He wasn't always.
Seven years ago, he was a mess.
He started drinking after his wife died of ovarian cancer.
Series of DUIs landed him in rehab.
Where he met Eva.
Mm-hmm.
I-I still -- I can't believe she's doing this.
That she could hate me so much.
Eva isn't your problem anymore.
She broke her parole. Hard.
She's going back inside.
I had this moment, 'Thena, I was standing over her.
And I thought about just...not helping her.
I almost let her die.
Does that make me an awful person?
Mm-mm.
It makes you a human being.
A good one.
Because despite everything that she put you through, you still saved her ungrateful ass.
And now this...
this man can come and take my son.
My wife will not forever forgive me for that.
Stop. Enough of that.
No one's taking Denny.
All right? This isn't about that.
All he wants is visitation.
Yeah, he has a case, but so do you and Karen.
You love that boy.
And anyone who spends five minutes with you can see that.
This Nathaniel Green will, too.
But will he care?
You got to have faith.
* Yeah, people can be awful.
Selfish and cruel.
* Lately...
Caring only about themselves and what they want and need.
* No holding back * No point in wasting sorrow * On things that won't be here tomorrow * Never thinking about who they hurt, or what kind of damage they might leave in their wake.
Oh, good, you're conscious.
Just need to have a few words with you.
What?
First up, you have the right to remain silent.
(crying) * Tell me it's okay BOBBY: Gloria? Gloria, my name is Bobby. We're here to help.
Okay. Yeah.
Okay, just try to stay calm.
You're gonna be all right.
Okay.
Okay? We're gonna cut you out of there.
ATHENA: But not everyone is awful.
There's some good ones out there, too.
The kind who want to do the right thing.
* I know it's a shame * Maddie, good work.
Gloria said some pretty awful things.
I'm glad you didn't let it get to you.
That's the job, right?
If I let everyone get to me, I wouldn't make it past breakfast.
ATHENA: But you'll never know which kind of person someone is unless you give them a chance to show you.
* I have spent so much of my time * NATHANIEL: I can tell Denny has a good life here.
* To be of use And I don't want to harm that in any way.
You're his parents.
You tell me what's best for him and I'll follow your lead.
ATHENA: Maybe they'll surprise you...
in the best way.
* I know it's a shame BOBBY: Okay, everybody, let's eat.
Hen. How'd it go?
Good.
Great.
I think it's gonna be okay.
(clears throat) Yes, Athena.
You were right.
(laughs) BOBBY: She usually is.
In fact, I find it best just not to argue with her.
* Shame.
ATHENA: Our lives are shaped, not just by our experiences, but by relationships.
Who we love.
Who loves us.
And the stronger those ties are, the less awful everything else seems.
@@@@@@
Okay, you've officially reached Fort Knox-level security.
Oh, you think it's too much?
Three motion sensors in the living room?
I mean, maybe if you're trying to keep Tom Cruise from getting his hands on your NOC list.
Mission: Impossible. No?
Sorry, haven't seen it.
Travesty.
EDDIE: Maybe we pop the hinges off the door.
Or we use the Jaws of Life.
No, no, no. It has to fit. I measured it twice.
Can't you guys just, you know, turn it around the other way?
And then the pizza will slide off.
You have pizza on my new sofa?
It's on the plastic.
Okay.
I'm sorry. You were showing me the security app.
EDDIE: All right, pivot. (grunts) Okay, so, basically, you can check everything on here.
(grunting) Lift with your legs.
And you can also check it on your phone if you're not at home.
That's great 'cause now if I hear a noise in the middle of the night, I don't have to get out of bed to know it's the ice maker.
Hey, thank you, guys, for helping me on your day off.
Don't worry about it. Plates?
Countertop.
Kitchen.
CHIMNEY: Beer?
Uh, also kitchen, fridge.
CHIMNEY: Clever.
He is so cute.
Yeah, he gets that a lot. Uh, you should meet his kid, though.
Wait, Chimney has a kid?
No, I-I thought you meant...
Chimney?
(dog barking) (clattering nearby) (gasps) (wind chimes jingling) (gasps, panting) (sighs) (door closes) (alarm clock beeping) (grunts softly) Oh...
* (sirens wailing) Hey, stay down! Stay down!
MAN: Get out of here.
WOMAN: Keep 'em back.
The pilot radioed they were having mechanical trouble.
Looks like he tried to put it down in the field over there.
Yeah, it got close.
Yeah, not close enough. Get down, people, move!
Move! Go!
All right, guys, we're gonna fan out, go behind those bleachers.
Eddie, after we get the people out, you think you can kill that engine?
Think so, I'm just worried about the dynamic rollover.
The dynamic what?
We change the weight ratio by pulling people out, whole thing could tip over, rotors could snap off.
And then flying rocks are gonna be the least of our problems.
All right, visors down. Let's go!
Buck, get her out of there.
On it, Cap.
Put your arms around me.
Yes. All right, here we go.
Okay.
Ah!
(shouting) Got to keep it moving.
All right.
All right, on three. One, two, three.
Pulse/ox is good. We can get rid of this.
How are you doing?
I'm not sure.
How's Trent? Is he okay?
Your pilot's gonna be just fine.
Hey, do me a favor. Uh, say, "And on the 405, "speeds are under five miles an hour, making your morning commute a rough one." Seriously?
I-I-I know that voice.
It's, uh, it's Taylor Kelly reporting, right?
Right. Skywitness News Eight.
That's me.
BUCK: Wow. Um, it's, uh, it's weird to hear that voice come out of a face.
Thank you?
Um, you have helped me beat traffic in this city more times than you will ever know.
Oh, you might want to Uber tomorrow.
(chuckles) Uh...
PRIEST: For justice and peace in the world, and that our leaders may be illuminated by the grace of God.
We pray to the Lord.
CONGREGATION: Lord, hear our prayer.
PRIEST: And for the repose of the soul of Brook Nash.
We pray to the Lord.
CONGREGATION: Lord, hear our prayer.
BOBBY: She would've turned 13 today.
PRIEST: Is it hard to reconcile that with the image you still have of her in your mind?
BOBBY: Yeah.
Especially around her birthday.
Brook's very last school project was a show-and-tell with her dad, the "hero." She was so proud of me.
I believe she's proud of you now.
I hope so, Father. I really hope so.
(sighs) TAYLOR: This is fantastic.
I love it. We need to capture it all.
Real life inside a firehouse.
Please, God, tell me there's a Dalmatian around here somewhere.
Excuse me.
Captain Nash, I'm Taylor Kelly.
We met the other day when...
I know who you are, Ms. Kelly.
I just don't understand what you're doing here.
Please don't film in here.
Uh, why not?
Because it's-it's rude.
Oh, they didn't call you yet.
Who?
FIREFIGHTER: Captain, Chief's office on the line.
Uh, Taylor Kelly?
(chuckles) Wh-What are you doing here?
You can just call me Taylor. Uh, how was your drive in?
Did you miss me?
My morning definitely wasn't the same without you.
(chuckles) I...
Hey, how're you feeling?
Any side effects after the crash?
I'm great.
Thanks to all of you, which is why I'm here. You guys were so amazing.
I want to do a story on this firehouse and on the heroes who work here.
Yeah, but you do traffic.
I'm not quite ready to go back in the sky, so I thought I'd try my hand at telling a story from the ground.
And use your newfound fame to put your face in front of the camera.
That, too.
Smart girl.
I can't wait to interview all of you.
I want to know why you chose this job, the crazy things you've seen, what it's like to face death.
I mean, Howie, you almost died, right?
Actually, nobody calls me that. It's Chimney.
I bet there's a story there.
Hmm.
Not one you can tell on TV.
(Taylor chuckles) Well, you must've really impressed the chief.
He said to give you whatever access you need.
Don't worry, Captain Nash, your story's in good hands.
I'm gonna make you all famous.
TAYLOR: Tell us about all this.
Oh. This table is all about the love.
It's, uh, tokens of appreciation from the people we serve.
Baked goods are big, and cards, we love the cards.
Mmm, and carbs. We love carbs.
But this stuff is what really keeps us going, the love.
Mmm, and the carbs.
And the carbs.
What made me want to become a firefighter?
That's a great question.
Short answer: I got shot.
Well, to be honest, I, um, I just kind of fell into it.
EDDIE: What I missed most after leaving the Army is the camaraderie, um, working shoulder-to-shoulder with a great team, and there's none better than the one I found here.
I mean, what little kid doesn't want to be a firefighter?
Especially...a hot firefighter.
That's for you. Go ahead.
HEN: The bullet wasn't meant for me, um...
I was 16 years old, walking home from school, and I hear this "pop, pop, pop." And next thing, I feel this penetrating pain just throw me to the ground.
The stray bullet had entered my back, ruptured a kidney, and, uh, grazed my aorta.
I was dying.
And then someone yelled, "Call 911." And I guess someone did because the next thing you know, I was in the back of an ambulance, and these two paramedics were working on me and just telling me to stay with them.
You know, their skill kept me from dying, but the way they cared for me...
that's what kept me alive.
TAYLOR: Yeah, let's go see if we can grab him. Come on.
Captain Nash.
Can we have a few minutes with you?
Um...
(alarm ringing) MAN (over P. A.): Attention, Station 118.
Engine and rescue. Got a report of adult male, difficulty breathing.
(sirens wailing) I was told there's a man here who's choking to death.
No, uh, Gregory says he doesn't want any help now.
Okay, excuse me, ma'am.
Wonder how many he put down.
Joey Chestnut scarfed down 74 hot dogs in ten minutes at last year's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.
Excuse me, sir, are you refusing care?
(hissing) Ah, geez!
EDDIE: Whoa.
Cute.
That thing yours?
That's Claude. He's the grand prize.
(groaning) BOBBY: Whoa, guys, guys.
Get them in. Give us some room.
Get this table and chairs out of here.
That means you guys, too. Give us some room. Back up.
Prep the defib.
HEN: Airways are sealing up.
I need the BBM.
What was this, like, a pepper eating contest?
No. Protein.
His pulse is thready.
(chirping) CHIMNEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Locusts!
Oh, whoa.
SANDY: No, they're actually crickets.
We allowed anything that Claude would eat.
We thought it might be fun.
His pulse is weakening. He's in V-fib.
He's coding.
CHIMNEY: Starting compressions.
Damn it, the blockage is too big.
He's not getting any air. Let me try something.
Come on, buddy.
Buck, give me the Magill.
CHIMNEY: Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, my God.
Right here, man.
Ugh.
I got it.
(gasps) (exhales loudly) He's back.
CHIMNEY: I got sinus rhythm, pulse action's rising. Let's get him up.
(retching) Try to breathe.
All this for a lizard, huh?
A monitor lizard, and 500 bucks.
And I just lost.
(mouth full): Yes, you did! Yeah!
(cheering) Almost.
MAN: Oh, roaches, dude.
Oh! Eat the roaches.
Yes, eat it.
(retches) MAN: Yes!
Claude, I guess you're staying with me.
(hissing) (gasps) (laughs): Oh.
I guess he likes you. He likes redheads.
Ah.
(laughs): Come on.
I just don't like her.
You don't like the intrusion?
I don't. I don't like cameras in the firehouse.
I certainly don't like them on calls.
Makes it harder for us to do our job.
Well, unfortunately, that's the reality nowadays.
Cameras everywhere.
Body cams, phone cameras, CCTVs.
Big Brother is definitely watching.
No, I'm more worried about Little Sister.
Are you gonna be on TV?
Not if I can help it.
Doesn't May like short ribs?
(laughs) Well, it might have something to do with that story you told at mealtime.
Oh.
No, she's on a stupid diet.
Wha -- still?
I told her she did not need to do that.
Why is May on a diet?
Oh...homecoming.
Her first. Dress search was epic.
Okay. Tell me what you think.
(gasps) Daddy didn't like the first one.
Said it was too low-cut.
HARRY: Yeah, it was.
I could almost see your belly button.
No, you could not.
It's perfect, May.
(giggles) Just like you. (laughs) Right, Bobby?
Yeah. You look beautiful.
MAY: Then I guess we have a winner.
BOBBY: Hey, guys, I'm sorry to cut this short, but I have, uh, an early shift, so I better get home and get a good night's sleep.
But I want to see all the pictures from your big night.
Good night, Bobby.
Good night.
Um...
I-I'll walk you out.
Oh, Bobby, Bobby, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry. I just...
I didn't think about how hard that would be for you.
No, don't-don't do that. Please.
Please, don't feel bad about this.
You have two wonderful children with a lifetime of milestones ahead of them, and I want you to be able to enjoy each and every one of them without worrying about me.
Well, don't tell me I can't do both.
I mean, multitasking is one of my many talents.
(both laugh) Come here.
Are you sure you don't want to come back inside?
Yeah, I should get some rest.
Tomorrow morning will be here before we know it.
All right, good night.
Night.
("You've Got Another Thing Comin'" by Judas Priest playing) (crowd cheering) ANNOUNCER: All right, Muscle Beach.
Time for the posedown. Who's your winner?
Look at those tapered waists, wide shoulders and explosive quads.
Too much for a man? You decide.
Double bicep.
Yeah!
ANNOUNCER: Side chest.
* And kind of proud (straining) * I'm on the top but as long as the music's loud * Back and bicep.
*
* If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by *
* You're thinking like a fool * 'Cause it's a case of do or die *
* If you think I'll let it go...* (screams) (siren wailing, horn honking) BOBBY: LAFD. Clear a path.
What the hell?
Keep filming.
Looks like extreme hyponatremia.
BRET: Say what?
He's got a charley horse.
Hea charley horse.
What's your name?
Charlie.
Okay, Charlie, when was the last time you had any fluids?
Yesterday afternoon.
Flushed yourself out for the competition today?
And for the weigh-ins, to make the veins pop.
Well, you are definitely popping.
All right, Charlie, your potassium and your sodium have bottomed out and that's why you're seizing up.
Now, before we start replenishing your electrolytes, you got to answer me honestly: are you dosing?
N-No steroids, if that's what you mean. I'm totally clean.
Okay, you two need to back off.
Get that camera out of here, please.
Cap needs room to work.
I'm working, too.
You can work further back.
Charlie, I just need you to know that if you're not being straight with me, and we start giving you saline and you have been dosing, your kidneys could start to fail, okay?
And that'd be on you.
I'm on steroids.
Okay, that's better. Are you taking anything else?
I took a diuretic last night to shed some water weight.
That explains his low blood pressure. 70/40.
All right, let's get him transported.
On three, everybody. Ready? One, two, three.
(shouting) Am I, am I gonna be okay?
We're gonna get you through the day.
You'd think he'd earn a trophy for holding that pose so long.
Right?
Captain, we'd love to get some words from you.
Okay, here's a few: stop pointing that camera at people who are in distress.
The people we serve have to feel like they can trust us and can be honest with us; otherwise, mistakes get made.
We're totally using that.
(Buck laughs) (mouths) All right...(chuckles) Is he always so prickly?
Who, Cap? Uh, nah. He, uh...
he barks a little, but ring that bell, he's, he's one of the guys.
I don't think he likes me much.
It's funny, 'cause you're so likable.
(laughs) Well, I am trying.
Look, Cap is not prickly, okay?
He just, he just doesn't know you yet, that's all.
We-we get two, three calls, right?
He's putting out fires all day.
The rest of us, we just have to be one thing at a time.
The guy in his job, he has to be everything.
The truth is, he inspires me every single day.
And I am trying to put a giant spotlight on him.
On all of you unsung heroes.
Tell your story.
To him, we're not the story.
We're just here to make sure no story ends before it should.
911. What is your emergency?
This is 911. Is anyone there?
WOMAN (over phone): I-I'm sorry. I...
Ma'am, are you having an emergency?
Do you need me to send some help?
(panting) Tell me where you are.
If you're afraid of someone hearing, if you're not alone, pretend you're talking to someone else.
A friend, a-a telemarketer.
Act like you're ordering a pizza -- just give me your location, and I will send help.
WOMAN: I'm sorry. Wrong number.
(dial tone) (panting) (gasps) Sue, hi. Good morning.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm-I'm just tired. I haven't...
been sleeping very well.
You've been a great addition to the team, Maddie.
I'm impressed with how you've taken to the job.
Sometimes, I forget you haven't been doing it for very long.
I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong?
Not at all. No.
But I am concerned.
You're tired, skittish. (laughs) I know the job can be stressful, and I just want to make sure that you know we have resources available if you're having trouble managing the stress.
There's no shame in asking for help.
It's not the job.
I mean, right this very second it is the job, but it's...
really that the job is reminding me of my life.
My marriage.
Call hit a little close to home?
She wouldn't...
couldn't speak, and I could hear her crying, and...
I knew what was wrong, but she wouldn't let me help her.
Maybe I should've told her that it was all gonna be okay.
You know, that she could just leave and not live her life in fear.
But it's not true.
I-I ran 2,600 miles away, and it doesn't even feel far enough.
(sniffles) I mean, my apartment is a fortress.
I sleep with a baseball bat by my bed, and I still don't feel safe.
It's like I never got up off that floor.
But you did.
You got up and you got out.
A-And I'm sure that there had been moments when the idea of that felt impossible.
Yet, here you are.
Just trust yourself and keep moving forward.
It's gotten you here so far.
It'll get you the rest of the way.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
New arrival.
When they send it in plastic, you know it's gonna be good.
Aw.
Serious, you guys? You couldn't even leave me any crumbs?
Ooh, Chim, you missed out.
Is that chocolate?
Mmm. Fudge, with nuts.
I love fudge with nuts.
Oh, damn, you would've loved these because...scrumptious.
I'm sorry you had to see this, this dark underbelly of hour 21 in a 24-hour shift.
Gets pretty mercenary around here.
(alarm ringing) MAN (over P. A.): Attention, Station 118.
Medical aid. Unknown injury.
PD's responding.
Where's Captain Nash?
He's sitting this one out, wrapping the shift.
It's a simple med call.
(siren wailing) (horn honking) He doesn't want to talk to you.
He'll talk to me.
I am done going up in that chopper and reporting on gridlock.
Come on.
Captain Nash, I know you don't think very highly of me.
I also know that you've been avoiding me.
But I want you to know I only have one goal here: to tell a story, a true story, about your station.
You can have a true story.
There's truth around us all the time.
There's truth right here on this napkin.
I'm sorry?
Every crumb is a universe onto itself.
The more you zoom in, the more you'll see.
Is he high?
(laughter) I think they're all high.
These are specs of chocolate and entire worlds at the same time.
Holy crap. I think it's the brownies.
They've been dosed.
Wait, you didn't have one, did you?
(chuckles) Do I look like I eat fudge?
Keep rolling.
(siren wailing, horn honking) Man. Allergies are going crazy today.
You, too, huh? The index wasn't elevated this morning.
Think it's a new kind?
New kind of what?
Of pollen.
A new kind of pollen?
You're not feeling this, Chim?
No, I do not.
I can see the pollen.
I can hear it.
This is ridiculous. She's the one who cheated.
She and her demon seed.
That little girl is 11 if she's a day.
I want to see the birth certificate.
Ma'am, calm down, or I'll charge you with resisting arrest, too.
For what? This was self-defense. My ex-husband's a lawyer.
Oh, good. 'Cause I'm-a need you to contact him to come and pick up your daughter.
Victim's over there.
NATALIE (muffled): Tell him it's an emergency.
Who goes to Aruba this time of year?
Excuse me, ma'am?
I'm trying to reach my plastic surgeon.
Okay, uh, uh, first things first.
Um, your adrenaline's probably spiked, which is why you haven't passed out yet, so I'm gonna ask you, please, just please sit right here, hold that if you can, and maybe hang up the phone, okay?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
All right, guys. Hey!
Diaz, Buckley, let's go!
(children giggling) Did these beauty queens shrink, or are we suddenly giants?
Please don't arrest me. I-I'll pay for any medical bills if we could just let this slide.
I'm so sorry. I stopped birth control because I started menopause, and now my hormones are going crazy.
Can I get my shoe back?
CHIMNEY: Can someone please bring me the rest of my gear?
I think he means you, guys.
BUCK: Hey, Athena.
They're, like, the tiniest ladies I've ever seen.
(high-pitched): Teeny-tiny. Just...
Excuse me?
(whispers): So tiny.
Henrietta!
'Thena.
Oh, 'Thena, you smell like love.
Chimney?
Need you over here.
727-L-30, requesting immediate R. A. backup at Beverly Wilton Hotel, Pacific Ballroom.
Where the hell is my lido...
We got a problem here.
Your guys be tripping.
What? Guys, look at me.
Do you know where you are?
We're everywhere, man.
They're on drugs.
(laughing) CHIMNEY: Okay, okay.
Oh. Oh, my God, it's the brownies.
Brownies?
We got a new batch today.
We've been getting a lot of stuff lately, especially since the earthquake.
You guys eat that stuff?
We just throw that stuff right in the trash.
We're firefighters. Everybody loves us.
Oh...
Now watch this.
You see?
Mm-hmm.
Do you know why the liquid rises like that?
Physics?
I'm gonna do it again.
I think...
No, this is show-and-tell.
It's not show-and-touch, Brook.
I don't want you to burn yourself.
I'm Taylor. Who's Brook?
There are so many lights in here.
And colors.
Lights and colors and death.
You died.
Someone died?
Did you lose someone, Captain Nash?
Brook?
She's not lost. She's right here.
She's taller than her mother now.
In a few seconds, she's gonna be taller than both of us.
TAYLOR: Hmm.
(echoes): She's still with you.
(echoes): She's always with me.
Nobody's picking up at the fire station.
You should call dispatch, get them to take everything off-line.
Did that.
Why aren't you taking it out?
They'll take it out at the hospital.
So let's go to the hospital.
We'll get you there. I called 911.
EDDIE: What's going on?
I don't like this.
Ooh, you made him cry.
ATHENA: All right, just breathe, okay? You're gonna be okay.
All right? Somebody dosed you with an hallucinogen.
We don't want you to hurt yourself or anyone else.
Yeah. I like that idea.
'Thena, your head is beating like your heart.
Is it?
Still no answer.
Do you know if Bobby ate any of those brownies?
(siren wailing) What happened?
He was high, and then he got higher.
ATHENA: Look at me again and tell me another joke.
We were talking and he mentioned something about Brook and then he shot up like the room was on fire and he said he had to go.
And you're okay filming this?
Who do you think called the cops?
Bobby.
Bobby, it's me.
Just take one step back, turn around, and we can talk.
Hey.
Hey.
They get it wrong, about saving lives.
The ones that we save are the ones we lose.
That's why we save them up here, like photographs.
But this, I've never -- this is new.
She's so bright and alive. Can you see her?
No.
It's not real. You know that.
No, my daughter Brook, she's...
she's floating in the sky, behind your head.
I know it sounds crazy.
I-I just want to float away with her wherever she goes, with so much color.
It's not real.
But maybe, just maybe, it can be enough.
Enough for you to say good-bye.
Enough for you to hear her say it's okay.
Enough so that in the morning, when your head is right and your eyes are clear, you can remember that you caught a glimpse of what's around us every day.
She's right there.
Right here, right now.
You're real, I'm real.
We can be real together.
Hey, how's the chief?
Ah, he's in pretty good humor, considering.
(chuckles) Tox report came back.
It was the brownies. LSD.
Mm. Do they know who?
It's still under investigation, but they figure it was some sort of prank.
Oh, yeah. Because poisoning firefighters is just funny. Ha.
I don't get the punch line.
Well, how about this one?
Taylor Kelly's exclusive report on 118 comes out tomorrow night.
Firefighters drugged against their will, captain loses sobriety, news at 11:00.
Do not waste a moment's worry on that woman.
It doesn't matter what kind of take she's trying to spin.
The camera doesn't lie.
Anyone who's watching is gonna see what I see: a good man who's been through some tough times, but who's come through the other side -- someone who, despite everything he's lost, still goes out there and risks everything he has left to help others.
They're gonna see a hero.
Hmm.
Athena, I'm an addict and an alcoholic who'll have barely three days under his belt.
I don't feel like a hero. I feel like a failure.
But you didn't fall off the wagon. You were pushed.
I know, but I don't feel like a failure 'cause I got high.
I feel like a failure because I want to get high again.
It felt good.
You know, it made me feel free.
I-I didn't feel as much of the pain.
I felt like it was far away, like it belonged to somebody else.
And I felt like if I could just keep floating, I wouldn't have to feel anymore.
Well, when I saw you after that, it looked like you were feeling all of it.
Yeah. Reality always catches up.
If it didn't, none of us would ever get sober again.
But you are, right?
Yes.
But it's...painful.
I go to my meetings and go to church.
I try to stay on track.
But when I'm sober, I feel this crushing weight on top of me and there are times like now when I feel like I don't know how much longer I can keep carrying it.
Well, maybe you should stop trying to carry it alone.
Did everything kind of sparkle?
Uh, I'd say it was more glistening, like the whole world was covered in dew.
You think this is why people go to Burning Man?
TAYLOR (on TV): We see them every day on the streets of Los Angeles, running into burning buildings, pulling people from wrecked cars and collapsing high-rises and even saving this reporter from a helicopter that spun out of control.
Where's Cap?
He's not watching with us?
No, said he had other things to do.
(chuckles) I think his words were he'd rather do anything other than this.
They are the brave men and women of the Los Angeles Fire Department and it was my own brush with death that inspired me to share their story so you can all see what it takes and what it means to be one of them.
You missed a hell of a show.
(grunts) All right, how bad was it?
No, not bad at all.
You were barely in it. Um, it was nice.
You know, kind-kind of like a puff piece.
She didn't use any of your interview or mention the LSD.
Why would she leave that stuff out?
(chuckles) I, um...
I think she likes me.
Hmm.
CHIMNEY (on video): I mean, what little kid doesn't want to be a firefighter?
Especially...a hot firefighter.
HEN (on video): You know, their skill kept me from dying, but the way they cared for me...
that's what kept me alive.
BOBBY (on video): The people we serve have to feel like they can trust us and be honest with us; otherwise, mistakes can get made.
They were great. And not just the medical stuff either.
I mean, they just, they seemed like real decent people.
SANDY (on video): I worry about them so, under so much stress all the time.
I wish I could do something to-to ease their burden.
A dose of something to lift their spirits.
Clear their minds.
The store closed hours ago, but I see a light on.
Sandy, you in here?
(gasps) Is that...?
(Athena stammers) I don't know.
It's some kind of hybrid -- part wild, part domestic cat.
Well, let's hope he's in touch with his domestic side.
Hey, buddy.
You're okay.
(Athena sighs) BOBBY: Sandy. Sandy?
ATHENA: You sure about this?
(lizard hissing) Uh, yeah. Pretty sure.
Ah. (laughs) This doesn't look safe.
I freed my mind.
Then I freed them. Oh. Oh.
Sandy, how much acid did you take?
Oh, not much. I microdose.
No, ma'am, I don't think you do.
In fact, I think you macrodosed my entire fire station.
Oh? Guess I put too much.
I-I just wanted to give you all a little clarity.
In my line of work, that's called a felony.
(laughs) TAYLOR (on TV): All across Los Angeles, residents are under attack from a new and troubling threat: Aedes aegypti, stealth-like mosquitoes that have invaded the Southland and are out for blood.
NEWSMAN: Wow. Well, thank you for that story.
(doorbell rings) That is some frightening stuff right there.
NEWSWOMAN: Exactly, we were just talking about this in the studio before we went to air, about this very problem...
Uh, just a minute.
I'll be right there.
(TV turns off) Hi. Come on in.
Hello.
So, I was just out and I saw this and I thought of you.
What? No.
It's just a housewarming gift.
(rattles) Oh. Not a book.
DVD. Mission: Impossible.
(laughs) Uh, you do have a DVD player, right?
Yeah. And a popcorn maker.
Would you like to hang out and watch a movie?
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.
(both chuckle) BUCK: Doesn't look like you'll have to worry about traffic anymore.
TAYLOR: Hey there.
I guess so.
Fire department piece was pretty well received, so they're letting me do more.
Nothing major yet, just mosquitoes and neighbors fighting about bamboo, but it's a start.
Well, I will miss hearing your voice every day.
Uh, I'm happy for you.
And-and I wanted to thank you for what you did for Bobby, not using any of that stuff he said.
Oh, that wasn't my call.
I wanted to use all of it.
I got overruled.
Uh, wait, you-you were gonna use it?
Hell yeah. The only reason we didn't is because apparently your lawyers are scarier than ours.
Look, your job is saving lives.
Mine is telling their stories, even the ones they might not want me to.
And some stupid job is all you really care about.
Hey, I wanted to be a reporter since I was 14.
I put myself through college, spent years interning for next to no pay.
I did traffic in the hopes that it would lead to my big break, which it did.
This stupid job isn't stupid to me.
You don't have to like it, but you don't get to make me feel bad about it.
Well, I don't like it.
And I don't care.
Just get a room already.
* There are days...
(doorbell rings) Mm.
Is he here?
Yeah, okay.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, I got the batteries.
Hey, you are a lifesaver.
Thank you so much, my man.
No problem, no problem.
Wow. Wow.
(laughs) I told him to just use the cell phone camera, but he's old-school.
Oh, he's a proud father. He wants those real photos.
All right, you want something to eat?
We have plenty.
I'm good.
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, Harry.
Come over here and take one with your sister.
Right here, right here.
Run, Bobby. Save yourself.
(laughs) Right here. Just right here.
This doesn't, uh, resemble my high school homecoming at all.
It's much more elaborate than I expected.
I know. Mine, either.
I am already dreading prom.
You know about prom proposals, right?
I do not.
What? Google it.
Another reason to be glad we're not teenagers anymore.
(Bobby laughs) HARRY: Your turn, Mom.
Come on, let's get this over with.
All right, you're on. All right.
(laughs) Yeah. Let's do this.
Let's do it. All right.
Oh, yeah, that's it. That's it.
Ooh.
Here, here.
Why don't you get in there? I'll-I'll take a few.
Oh, with me?
Yeah.
Oh, man. You know what? That's nice. That's nice.
You bet. All right.
Thank you.
It's the real deal right here. This is a serious camera.
All right. One happy-looking family.
ATHENA: Ah.
(Bobby laughs) Oh, honey. What happened to your bracelet?
It must've fell off. I have to find it.
Grandma gave that to me.
Oh.
BOBBY: Wait, I think this is it right over here.
Yep. All right.
MAY: Awesome.
All right.
Okay, May. Let's see if I can do this.
There we go. Perfect.
Thanks so much, Bobby.
(laughs) All right, we're back in business.
Okay.
All right. Look up here.
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Nico, would you mind taking a picture of all of us, please?
Bobby, get in here.
I shouldn't. It should just be the family.
Come on. Just one. Come on.
* I'd stop the world if it gave us time * Okay. All right.
(laughs) Right there.
Okay.
I warned you.
* You open up your heart * When you love someone * You make room * You probably never loved someone like I do. *
@@@@@@
BUCK: If there's one hard thing you learn in this job it's that, one way or the other, this day or the next, eventually...
everything dies.
For most people, the only thing worse than losing someone you love is knowing that, one day, you will.
Mom, Dad, I want you to know I-I've decided to sell the house.
I know how much it meant to you guys.
It did to me, too.
Please don't be mad.
(sighs) (low groan) (gasps) (low groaning) So, we have one guy still missing?
Yes, it's horrible.
Elisio and Stavros were preparing Mrs. Mandechek's final resting place, and they just got sucked in.
Okay.
Sir, can you tell me what happened down there?
Me and Stavros were...
digging a plot...
(coughs) when we got pulled in.
Like the grave was digging itself.
A sinkhole. The quake shifted everything around down there.
We're all basically walking around on eggshells and bubble wrap. See it?
How long ago did this happen?
I don't know.
Half an hour, maybe?
Let's move, guys.
Whoa...
Easy. This whole side is like quicksand.
I don't want you to fall in there and drag ten tons of loose soil on top of yourself and our friend down there.
He's been breathing dirt for a half hour, Cap.
Well, maybe not.
What are you thinking?
Eggshells and bubble wrap.
Air pockets.
Yeah, we just have to find out where they are.
Whoa, th-those aren't...
BOBBY: Coffins and corpses.
That's where the air pockets are.
That's messed up.
(beeping) BOBBY: Oh. Hello, Stavros.
All right, shovels and buckets.
Let's go.
Here you go.
Got one.
Whoa!
Whoa. You okay?
Yeah.
Okay, that can't be good.
Keys for this thing?
Sh-Should still be in it.
We're gonna get this man out of here one damn way or another. Clear out!
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
BOBBY: All right, fellas.
CHIMNEY: Get out. Get out, guys. Come on.
(engine starts) Oh! I got-I got him.
(Stavros grunting) Okay, easy. Easy. You're okay.
Take it slow. Take...
(gasping deeply) CHIMNEY: All right, we got you.
HEN: All along...Hang on.
We got you, Stavros, we got you.
BOBBY: Nice and slow.
Try to relax.
Breathe, breathe. Relax. Relax.
We got you. Relax. We got you.
(grunting) CHIMNEY: We got you. Try to relax.
Now, that was strictly badass.
You literally pulled a man from a grave.
(chuckles) We did. I just hope they understand.
Hope who understands?
The spirits we disturbed.
I don't need that mess following me home.
(rumbling) Hey. What's going on?
That phone call was pretty cryptic.
It's about your father.
My father?
What are you talking about, Karen?
I haven't spoken to my father since...
I was, like, nine.
He's in the ICU.
This hospital? He's here?
Yeah.
He was brought in yesterday, unconscious.
They've been trying to get in touch with us ever since.
How did they know to look for me?
He had your name and our address in his wallet.
DOCTOR: Your father suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage.
It caused bleeding within the brain.
So what's the prognosis here?
Well, we're seeing severe, widespread damage.
HEN: These machines are the only thing keeping him alive.
And you want to know whether or not to withdraw life support.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.
Without an advance directive, our protocol is to treat, to keep him alive until we can contact the next of kin.
And that's me.
911. What is your emergency?
(radio static): HIKER (panting): Uh, I was hiking, fell off...(grunts) The cliff gave out.
Can you-can you hear me?
Uh, I-I can hear you, sir.
I'm here. Do you know where you fell?
I w...I was on the San Ramon Trail. I think...
(feedback whines) Oh, God. I broke my leg, for sure.
I can see the bone in...
I-I can barely hear you, sir.
Can you tell me precisely where on the trail?
Vista Point, Abalone Cove.
I'm bleeding. Please, God, help me. Please...
(sharp feedback) (beep) (noise stops) Hello?
HEN: I'm staring at this stranger in this bed, tubes coming out of him.
I don't know this man.
How am I supposed to make a life-and-death decision for a total stranger?
Hen, you do realize we're not driving around in a mail truck here?
You make life-or-death decisions for total strangers every single day. How is this any different?
Those total strangers didn't abandon me when I was nine.
Look, I don't mean to sound cold, but is there really even a decision that needs to be made here?
I mean, that prognosis -- people don't generally recover from something like that.
Well, people don't generally survive rebar through their brain either.
But then they surprise you.
Touché.
The old trail should be right up there.
Park warden said they closed it down a few years back. Guess every once in a while they still get a thrill-seeker who ignores the signs.
They haven't been able to ping the phone?
Yeah. No contact since the call was dropped.
Cap.
Yeah.
Guess this is where he went over.
All right, everybody gear up.
Hen, Chimney, get the winch and the guidelines.
Prep a basket just in case.
I'm gonna radio Aerial Recon, have 'em on standby.
Copy that.
This is Captain Bobby Nash. T-118.
Aerial Recon to Abalone Cove in Palos Verdes.
DISPATCHER: Copy that, T-118.
(grunts) All right, big jump, Eddie. Come on.
Buck, Eddie, you guys see anything down there?
No.
Just a million-dollar view.
Cap, found something.
BOBBY: Is it our hiker?
(grunts) A hiker.
Don't think it's the one we came looking for.
It's human remains, Cap.
Skeletal remains.
All right. Well, flag it but don't disturb it.
We'll call it in.
Unless...
What, you think a ghost called 911?
I'm just saying.
IAN (in distance): Help!
Okay. So, no ghost.
BOBBY: What's going on down there, guys?
BUCK: Yeah, I think we heard something, Cap.
(Ian groaning) Easy, buddy. We're here.
BUCK: Hey, Cap, we got a live one.
Can you tell me your name?
(grunts) Ian.
Ian, okay. We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
My le-my leg is broken.
(groaning) All right, guys, we're gonna send a basket down to you.
How'd you find me?
It wasn't easy. You weren't on long enough for them to ping your phone.
On with who?
With, uh, with 911.
I dropped my phone when I went over.
I didn't call 911.
(groans) You guys still decorating those pumpkins?
How many are you making? (chuckles) Oh, and why so many ghosts?
Well, they're for Buck.
I'm gonna put 'em all over the firehouse.
Bobby says he thinks a ghost called 911.
BOBBY: Mm.
That'd be so cool if it did.
Well, Buck certainly thinks so.
But ghosts aren't real.
HARRY: Tommy Sheridan's family used to live in this apartment where this little old lady died, and he said the lights used to flicker when they used the tea kettle.
(Athena laughs) Didn't that building get red-tagged after the earthquake?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sounds more like faulty wiring than signals from the other side.
Harry, over 100 billion people have lived on this planet.
Pretty sure a little old lady has died everywhere.
Probably even in this very house.
(laughs) (stammers) All right. All right, all right, all right.
Enough of that, okay?
Your dad's coming to pick you up soon.
Why don't you guys go get your stuff ready.
Thanks for the help. I'll let you know how it goes.
Mm-hmm.
* They did the Monster Mash * The zombies were having fun...* A ghost called 911, huh?
Well, we were out on this call at Vista Point.
A hiker fell off a cliff.
I sent Buck and Eddie down to look for him, and they found bones.
Human?
Yeah.
We also found the hiker, alive, but he dropped his phone when he went over the edge, and now Buck is convinced that it was our skeletal friend who made the call.
Well, what do you think happened?
Eh, I think people like to go hiking on that trail even though they know they're not supposed to.
And somebody saw him go over and picked up his phone, used it to make the call so that nobody would know that they were there, too.
What do you know about the bones?
Well, not much. He'd been out there for a while.
He?
Yeah, there was this wedding band.
Based on the ring size, Eddie figured it must've been male.
Hmm. Vista Point.
Palos Verdes, right?
Yeah.
Why are you getting all detective on this?
This isn't your beat.
I'm a field sergeant.
I go where I want.
All right.
Athena Grant. Hey, Randy?
Yeah, how you doing?
I hear you guys caught a real cold case today.
What?
Mm-hmm.
You want to help me clean this up?
PRINCIPAL: Our grounds include two outdoor play areas, state-of-the-art gymnasium, music, theater, the full range of academic offerings, as well as behavioral and cognitive programs.
(chuckles) Look. Um...
The programs sound good, but Christopher's happiness is what's important to me.
I want him to feel normal, not like some special-needs charity case.
Every child is special. And, yes, some do have additional needs, but they're all equally our children.
They learn as much from each other as they do from us.
I think Christopher would be well cared for.
(chuckles softly) Okay. Let's do it.
The only thing left would be the family interview.
I'm sorry?
Oh, Christopher's terrific.
We have your information. All we need now is to meet Mrs. Diaz.
That won't be a problem, will it?
No, it's definitely a problem.
Look, I know Christopher's mother is a touchy subject with you, but I'm sure if we explain the situation to Principal Summers we can find a work around.
Do you have a copy of the custody agreement?
There isn't one.
We're still married.
(indistinct chatter) (woman screams) WOMAN: I don't understand why people would pay for this.
It's a bunch of guys in masks making minimum wage to say "boo." Hey, I'm paying just to laugh at you screaming.
(people shrieking) (music playing) Aah!
Whoa. Okay. (chuckles) Okay. Okay.
CHRIS: Oh, my God.
Uh, Chris, tell me you see those.
(growls) CHRIS: Damn, special effects are on point.
I don't think those are special effects.
(gasps) Oh...
Whoa.
(people screaming) CHRIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(screaming continuing) Do we know if anybody was bitten?
You mean in like a Nosferatu, Count Whatever kind of way?
Listen, something like ten percent of bats are rabies carriers. If I got guys in there foaming at the mouth, I need to know.
I don't think. I mean, most of the injuries happened in the stampede out.
Anybody left inside?
A few stragglers, maybe.
But we got cast in there still trapped in their rigs.
Buck, Eddie, head around back, see if you can figure out the power situation.
We can't save what we can't see.
On it, Cap.
But, it's not a phobia, it's not even a fear.
It's just, rats and mice are way high up on my list of things that should absolutely not grow wings.
I mean, how does this happen?
Easy. These dumb-asses built a haunted house beneath their natural habitat during a damn mosquito epidemic.
Ah. Good job, boys.
Anybody back here?
Oh, thank God.
My boyfriend -- when the bats spooked, he ran face-first into the wall.
He hit his head pretty hard.
I'll say he did.
(Chris groaning) CHIMNEY: Got him.
Sir, can you sit up?
All right, here we go. (grunts) Sir, do you know what year it is?
Uh, 2018.
Can you tell me who the president is?
(chuckles) Come on, do I have to?
He'll be fine.
Athena. What are you doing here?
I heard about your, uh, ghost call.
Oh, God. Buck won't let it go.
I-It seems like the hiker that they rescued is gonna be okay.
Yeah. I'm actually here about the one who wasn't so lucky.
TERRY: I went back and did some digging.
I pulled any call that referenced Vista Point.
You're thinking what -- six, seven years ago?
Our skeleton had a cell. Pay as you go.
Untraceable, but, uh, the number was reassigned six years ago, so I thought that maybe that could narrow the search a little.
And that's all you have?
Well, that and this.
Initials on the inside of a band.
Six letters of the alphabet. Not much to go on.
Your cell phone lead might be.
I've got one here. October 29, 2011.
OPERATOR (on recording): 911. What's your emergency?
(radio static): HIKER (panting): Uh, I was hiking, fell off...
(grunts) The cliff gave out.
Can you-can you hear me?
OPERATOR: You're breaking up. What's your location?
No. That's not right. That sounds like my call from yesterday. Pull it up.
MADDIE (on recording): 911. What is your emergency?
(radio static) Uh, I-I can hear you, sir.
I'm here. Do you know where you fell?
I don't understand. There was a voice on the other end of the line.
What, same voice from seven years ago?
Yes.
So a ghost called 911?
He was down there for seven years.
I guess he got tired of waiting.
(quietly): So it was a ghost.
Why are you whispering?
(laughing); And what did I just say?
Yes, but your tech guy says it was some kind of glitch in the system.
(sighs) Turns out a bunch of the calls had weird static.
Okay, so how do you explain that it was the exact same call?
I said it sounded like the same call.
A lot of these calls sound the same.
Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better, but we both know a ghost called 911.
Okay.
You know, I keep thinking about the wedding ring.
I mean, you saw it, right?
How many nights someone was just waiting for news.
I heard somewhere a person is declared legally dead after they've been gone for seven years.
Yeah. I think you have to sign, like, a petition or something.
God, that is so awful.
Having to admit to the world that you've lost hope.
Well, seven years is a long time.
Probably lost hope way before that.
No one can wait forever.
Yeah, hope is a tricky thing.
Yeah, it keeps you going for a while, but...
at some point, if what you're hoping for is never gonna happen...
then it's just holding you back from your life.
Yeah, but it's hard to know, though, right?
If you're hanging on too long or...
if you're giving up too soon.
I think you do know.
It just may take you some time to admit it to yourself.
Well, at least it's neat.
HEN: I don't know if he even had a living will.
Doesn't look like there's a lot of money laying around for lawyers.
Well, you can find forms online.
Maybe that's what he did.
Mmm.
Uh...
I'll go check his desk.
* How's it going over there?
Babe, come look at this.
What, you found the will?
No.
It's that article the Times did on paramedics.
Oh, my God, with that awful photo of me?
I happen to love that photo of you.
This story is three years old.
How long has my dad been back here?
(knocking) Hi.
Hi.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
SHANNON: He's gotten so big.
(chuckles) Has...
he asked about me?
Not in a while.
He has a lot to keep him busy, though -- the move, new school, new city, new people.
Sure, sure.
Yeah. He must've been shocked when you said you were leaving Texas.
I sure was when you called yesterday.
Shannon...
So...tell me about this school.
They want to meet you. Well, need to meet you.
It's a requirement for admission.
It looks...fancy.
Not the kind of place I thought you'd be into.
Classes are smaller.
Ten kids instead of 30. Uh...
I mean, the art studio...
You should have seen him.
Can I?
See him?
I mean, this is a big step.
Switching schools when he just got here.
Maybe I could talk to him?
Make sure it's what he wants.
I don't think that's a good idea.
It...it might confuse him.
What's confusing?
I'm his mom.
Who he hasn't seen in almost two years?
My mother was sick. She was all alone.
I...You know why I had to go.
Yeah, but we were expecting you to come back.
And you didn't.
You could've come with me.
But you didn't want to leave Texas and your parents and your sisters, and...
At least not until it was something that was important to you.
That's not fair. I was trying to do what's best for Christopher.
Right.
Because Eddie always knows what's best for everyone.
I mean, God forbid you stop for a second and actually ask them what they need.
What did you need that I didn't give you?
You!
I needed a husband and a co-parent.
And instead, all I got was a life alone in Texas with a baby and you on another continent.
I needed someone to have my back.
I always had your back.
No.
You were in Afghanistan.
(door opens, closes) Thanks again for coming by.
Sometimes I like the quiet when Michael has the kids.
Other times, not so much.
(chuckles) Are these the remains we found the other day out in Palos Verdes?
Mm-hmm.
I'm trying to ID them.
You know, notify the next of kin, hopefully.
That's your job?
What, helping people?
I like to think so.
No, no, no. I mean, don't detectives do that?
I'm sure they're gonna drop all their hot cases where the victim just died and the clues are everywhere to find out what happened to a pile of bones just laying out in the open, forgotten.
I mean, I'm not saying they don't care.
They're just too busy.
So, did you run a DNA test?
Yeah, I set one up, but it's gonna take time.
Dental records will probably come back first.
Suddenly there's a rush?
Did I ever tell you about when I decided to become an officer of the law?
(sighs) I was nine years old.
Middle of the night.
I wake up and I see my father getting dressed.
Grabbing a flashlight, his gun.
I look out the window, and I see the whole neighborhood out there.
A little girl -- she was, uh, a grade behind me at school -- had gone missing.
Someone had just snatched her right out of her bed.
Nightmare.
They find her?
They found the barrette out of her hair out in the woods.
But that was it.
She was just gone.
My mother, she went over to the girl's parents' house twice a week, bringing food, that kind of thing.
I almost never saw them except at church.
That was the only time they went out.
But I remember how much they would change.
Just one week of not knowing where their baby was was enough to age them.
It was just six months or so before they were totally broken.
and I promised myself that when I was old enough I was gonna become a policewoman and find that little girl for those people.
Ease their pain.
Did you find her?
I did not.
But somebody...
loved this man.
You're thinking about your father?
He's the ghost that haunts my brain.
You any closer to figuring out what to do?
It shouldn't be such a struggle.
I think a part of me is hoping that he'll wake up...
so that I can meet him, finally.
I never even let myself...
imagine who this man was all these years.
It was just too...much pain to make him real in my mind's eye.
(crying): Which means that...
I've never hated him enough to feel good about pulling the plug on him.
Well, now at least you know he was a man haunted by his demons and channeling his own angels.
Like any of us.
(phone vibrating) I'll be damned.
Medical just got a hit.
You got a name?
Cal State Prison.
Alex Armando Perez.
He was just 22 years old.
He'd only been out six months.
(laughs) Are you some kind of pirate?
Snake Plissken?
Escape from New York?
Kurt Russell?
John Carpenter's masterpiece?
Oh, right, right. Well, I prefer Tango & Cash myself.
But you look cute, so I approve.
(laughs) Though I'm disappointed that costume didn't come with a smile.
I had a fight with Shannon.
When I asked her to help with Christopher and the school, she asked to see Christopher first.
And you said no? Okay, if you want her back in your life, you're gonna have to ease her back into it at some point.
Who said I want her back in my life?
Please.
So you decided to leave Texas, and you just so happened to choose a job working 30 minutes from where your ex lives?
LAFD are the best in the country.
In the world.
If she's gotten herself back together, you know what's best for your son.
And that's for his mother to be back in his life.
Sooner than later.
What if she screws up again?
Both of you have grown up a lot over the years.
And a boy needs his mama.
CHRISTOPHER: Daddy?
(growls) You know what, you're so cute, I could just rip you to shreds.
(both growling) (Carla laughing) * What's his name?
Hey. This is City Slicker.
He's a quarter horse.
Do you get to keep him?
No, he belongs to the police, but I get to take care of him and I train him on how to be a good police horse.
Would you like to feed him some apple?
(screaming) (neighing) Whoa...
Whoa!
MAN: ...got burned all over his face!
WOMAN: There's a horse running, and he looks really spooked!
POLICE OFFICER: Officer down. Repeat, we have an officer down.
Requesting immediate assistance.
* (low grunting) DAN: Easy, City.
He never gets spooked.
It was too many things at once.
I don't know if the air splint will fit his leg. I...
You know, may-maybe I can try and rig something.
It's not just his leg.
CHIMNEY: Should I radio for Animal Services?
It's gonna take them an hour to get here.
He's in pain.
Maybe the-the vet can fix it.
HEN: Horses are very prone to infection.
Their intestines don't respond well to antibiotics.
It's almost impossible for the immune response to work effectively.
How much does he weigh?
About a thousand pounds.
We don't have enough barbiturates on the truck to get it done.
He would need a sedative first.
Get it done?
Otherwise he would just thrash around like crazy till his heart gave out.
Are you sure you want to do this?
We-we could...we could try other things.
We both know they won't work.
He's a good boy.
I just don't want him to suffer anymore.
(City Slicker groans) (sniffles) It's okay, bud.
It's okay.
HEN: Administering sedative.
(whinnying) Thank you, buddy.
Thank you for keeping me company.
Thank you for keeping me safe.
Now you're gonna go to sleep, okay?
When you wake up, you're gonna be in a field of sage, and you can just run forever.
But you don't have to stay and watch anymore.
You don't have to be strong or calm or brave.
You can just be free.
(City Slicker groans) Just be a horse again.
Morphine.
(whispers): Bobby?
You want me to do it, Hen?
No, I got it.
(sighs) Hen.
(sighs) * (Dan sniffling) He's my friend.
He's my friend.
(kids chattering) (sighs) GIRL: Trick or treat!
(knocking) Alana Perez?
I'm Sergeant Grant. I'm here about Alex.
ALANA: When?
We identified his remains yesterday.
But it'd been awhile.
Seven years.
I saw your missing persons report.
They kept trying to tell me he'd run out on me.
That he'd gone back to his old life.
I'd get so...
mad.
Not that nobody believed me...
but that nobody believed in him.
There was no evidence of foul play.
It looks he was just hiking and the...
the road washed out beneath his feet.
The medical examiner will contact you about his remains.
In the meantime, I-I thought you might like to have this.
Mami, Mami, can we go now?
Yes, baby, of course. Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, thank you for coming by, Mrs. Diaz. It was a pleasure to meet you.
You, too. Thank you.
You're welcome. Have a good day.
Hey.
Hey.
School called to tell me about your appointment.
Thought I'd head over.
Well, don't worry.
I didn't tank the interview, okay?
Least, I don't think I did.
I'm sure you did great.
I appreciate it. Christopher will, too.
That's why you're here -- to pass along thank-yous from my own son?
When you left...
I understood.
I tried to.
And you were taking care of your mother, and I was trying to take care of Christopher, and...
and we-we just drifted further away from each other.
But I always thought you'd come home.
Maybe we'd have a chance to make things right.
But you didn't.
So I guess I-I just...
I need to know.
Why?
I didn't know how.
I mean, the longer I was gone, the harder it was to come back.
To face you. And to face Christopher and...
He must hate me.
What are you talking about? Why would Christopher hate you?
Because I did this to him.
I have relived every moment of that pregnancy so many times, just trying to figure out how it happened, and...
what I did wrong.
And I thought I could make up for it, so I did all this research, finding new treatments and different therapies.
But it was all still so overwhelming and exhausting, and I just...
needed a break.
So then the mother who hurt her kid left him.
I'm sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong.
What happened...
wasn't your fault.
(sniffles) I...I know that.
I just...
I don't feel it.
Christopher loves you.
(chuckles softly) And he misses you.
I miss you.
I missed you.
* Everyone in my life -- my sister, the team -- they're on my side.
Now, what I really need right now is to talk to someone on Abby's side.
Okay, Buck, you know I don't do sides.
But you know...
I love both of you.
Yeah, but you know her.
All right, honestly, maybe even better than I do right now.
I, uh, haven't spoken to her in weeks.
The gap between talks keeps getting longer, and the conversations shorter.
There's this...this voice in my head keeps on saying...
"Move on, Buck.
She's never gonna come back." She still cares about you.
She's just not ready to come home yet.
At least not to this one.
Wait, what does that mean?
Her brother's been after her, you know, to come stay with them for a bit.
And truthfully, I think it'll be good for her.
I mean, she needs to go and dip her toe in the real world.
So, you know, she doesn't have a fear of being pulled under by all of these memories.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Everything in this place is hers.
She feels less and less a part of it every day.
See, this-this whole time, I-I felt like I was being haunted by this memory of her, but...
but maybe I'm the ghost.
Lingering here when...
when I should've moved on a long time ago.
You probably didn't know this, but when I was a little kid, I used to write you letters.
Mom said that we would mail them off as soon as we got your new address.
That never happened, but I kept writing.
I wrote about my Cabbage Patch dolls.
And the day I got inducted into the National Honor Society.
And that moment...
I saw my best friend and I...
I realized I wanted to kiss her.
You became like my diary.
Confessions to an imaginary daddy.
I don't know what you would've wanted, 'cause I don't know you.
I can only go off of what I would want.
And I wouldn't want to live like this.
Some ghost in a hospital bed.
So I'm gonna forgive you, Dad.
And let you...and let you go.
* And I'll use you as a warning sign...* BUCK: We are all haunted.
* Enough sense, then you'll lose your mind...* By the ones we've loved and the ones we've lost.
* And I'll use you as a focal point...* By the choices we've made and the ones we still struggle with.
* And I've moved further...* Our lives are like a series of ghost stories.
* But I missed you more * Than I thought I would * And I'll use you as a warning sign...* Sometimes all we can do is turn the page.
Let go.
(monitor flatlines) * And I found love * Where it wasn't supposed to be...* That's what I need to do now.
I'm not sure if you'll ever come back or how I'll feel if you do, but I am sure that I cannot wait anymore.
You are my ghost story, Abby.
You are the amazing spirit that blew into my life, turned it upside down, and then vanished into the night.
Being with you made me a better man, and for that I will always love you.
Now it's time for me to figure out who I am without you.
@@@@@@
If you're just joining us, the morning commute has gotten a little more dramatic over on the 5.
Let's check in with Channel 8's Taylor Kelly, who is on the ground. Taylor?
Ann, Dwight, traffic at this exit came to a screeching halt about ten minutes ago.
But CHP is telling me the backup is already a mile long.
Why the sudden stop?
This woman. We don't know her name, but we do know she is desperately trying to get the attention of somebody named Norman.
First responders are just arriving to the scene and hopefully executing a plan to get this woman back down to earth and traffic back on the move.
Reporting live, this is Taylor Kelly, Channel 8 Morning News.
Hell no! I won't come down until Norman sees me!
And don't you try to force me down!
ATHENA: Nobody's gonna force you to do anything.
We're just gonna talk.
What's your name?
Lola!
Lola, my name's Athena.
What's the problem?
The problem?
The problem is, after 30 years of marriage, I can't get 30 seconds of attention from my husband!
It's like I'm invisible!
But I'm-I'm not invisible!
I am here, damn it!
See me, Norman!
See me now?!
(cheering, applause) Oh, for God's sake.
Definitely not invisible.
(sighs) Can somebody please find me this Norman before she does something crazy...er?
(horns honking) (indistinct chatter) (groans) (sighs) Un-friggin'-believable.
(indistinct chatter continuing) (laughing) LOLA (on phone): ...after 30 years of marriage, I can't get 30 seconds...
Hey, how are you? Can I get a...
maybe a large coffee and a bear claw?
Oh, hey. Do you know what's going on?
Yeah, some lady up there thought social media wasn't, like, social enough, and so she's blowing up her marriage in real time.
Oh, no. (chuckles) This Norman guy is screwed.
See me, Norman? See me now?!
(laughing) NORMAN: Oh, God.
MADDIE: 911. What is your emergency?
NORMAN: Yeah, it's my wife. She's lost her mind.
She's-she's on a freeway sign.
Norman? Is that you?
Yes, this is Norman. This is Norman!
Norman, where are you?
Stuck in the backup.
One exit south.
I'm sending someone to you.
(speaking indistinctly) Lola, good news.
We found your man. He's on his way.
I won't come down until he sees me!
Ma'am, you're the most famous face in the city right now. There ain't exactly a way to miss you.
I don't care.
Okay, move Buck into position.
Okay, Chim.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?!
I-I told you!
I told you!
It's just there for your safety, Lola.
I-I told you!
(grunts) I told...(grunts) Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Stand down. Do not shoot.
(grunts) Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Lola, listen to me very carefully.
You now have every firearm in the Greater Los Angeles area pointed at you. If you continue to threaten that man, they will fire.
Do you understand?
Do you?
I don't want to hurt anybody.
I just can't handle being ignored anymore.
I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, come on.
Yes, I'm-I'm sure you get ignored all the time.
You have a Norman.
I had an Abby.
He's talking to her?
Yeah, that's either gonna go well or...
the other thing.
You think that you have something...
something special, you know?
She's the one.
So you wait.
And then, at some point, it hits you: you're alone.
Sh-She's not coming back.
You're just there to collect the mail, and-and it is piling up, right?
And then-and then you realize...(stammers) "You know what?
It's over." You just need to face it and move on.
(sighs) (engine revving) You Norman?
Yeah. I'm-I'm Norman.
I don't know why this is happening.
We don't even fight.
I'm pretty sure that's why this is happening.
Wait, seriously?
All right, come with me.
(feedback) Uh, L-Lola.
Lola, honey, it's me.
I'm here. And I see you, just like the sign says.
Liar!
You look right through me.
Y-You don't even notice me.
I-I'm just around to...collect the mail.
I don't even know what that means. I'm the one who brings in the mail.
Just talk to her.
Lola, honey.
Honey, now, listen to me.
I-I'm here, and I see you.
And I need you to put down the gun, okay?
Put the...put down the gun and let them bring you to me.
And then we can spend the rest of our lives together, and I can show you how much I love you.
I don't believe you, Norman.
You don't even know who I am anymore.
I mean...I don't even know.
I'm-I'm confused. Now, is she saying I don't see her or I don't know who she is, like I don't recognize her?
How the hell am I supposed to know?
She's your wife.
I've been a mother for 18 years.
And now that Zack's gone, I don't remember who I was before that.
Back when you used to look at me.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it is over.
Uh, n-no, no, no, no, no.
Um, okay, m-maybe I wasn't being super clear on the point I was trying to make...
(feedback) ("In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel playing) Oh, my God. (sniffles) That song.
* Love He remembered.
* I get so lost It was our first date.
We went to see S-Say Anything.
NORMAN: I see you.
I see you.
Lola, I see you.
I see the girl who used to sneak out to the beach bonfires and listen to The Psychedelic Furs and The Cure. Lola!
Lola, I see you!
I see the girl who once drank nine shots of Jäger and woke up without a hangover!
Lola, I see you.
I see the girl I love!
* And the grand facade (cheering, applause) * So soon will burn Yes! (laughing) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
* Without my pride (panting) It's okay.
I think I want to get down now.
*
* In your eyes * The light, the heat * In your eyes *
* I am complete What'd you say to her?
Just, you know...
that everything's gonna be okay.
* The resolution * In your eyes *
* Of all the fruitless searches *
* In your eyes *
* In your eyes *
* Oh, I see the light and the heat * I'm sorry about all that. It's just that...
(chuckles) he sees me.
Norman sees me.
Yeah, everyone sees you now, Lola.
Unfortunately, they're about to see you get arrested.
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say (mouthing) can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I love you.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you do not have an attorney, one will be appointed to you.
* Oh-oh * You are really mashing those potatoes.
Uh, they're done.
So are you.
(sighs) Just relax. Everything's gonna be fine.
We'll have a nice evening. Good food.
Pleasant conversation.
Yeah.
Well, I'd rather be spending it with just us.
Not us and the kids and my ex and his boyfriend.
Thanks a lot, Mom. I love you, too.
(Bobby chuckles) Oh, don't be smart. You know I didn't mean the two of you.
I just feel bad that you're spending your night off dealing with our family drama.
Well, didn't you reschedule this three times so I could be here to act as a human shield?
(scoffs) Are you shielding Mom or Glenn?
Pleading the fifth.
(door opens) MICHAEL: Hey, we're here, everybody.
There he is.
Mom, (Michael chuckles) I know this is awkward and weird.
But Glenn's a good guy.
He makes Dad happy.
Just give him a chance.
(clicks tongue) Come on.
She's right. Michael's been very supportive of us.
Is this so different?
Listen, if Michael had left me for another woman, no one would expect me to slap on a fake smile and welcome her into my home.
Michael, Glenn, I am so glad you were able to make it.
I'm so glad to be here. Thank you for having me.
(chuckling): Aw!
(chuckles) (indistinct chatter) * I'm doing 28 to life * (whooping) * I'm watching day turn into night * (indistinct chatter continuing) The world looks so different now that I'm single again.
Buck, you've been single for months.
Yeah, only circumstantially. I know Abby's been gone for a while, but, in my head, we've been together this whole time.
But now I'm out of her place...
And living on my couch.
Which I-I really appreciate.
Happy to help. Even though I did initially think you were just coming over to watch the game.
I'm just...I'm nervous, you know?
Are you afraid to get back on the horse?
I don't want to revert back to being Buck 1.0.
(phone vibrates) I-I know I'm single Buck again, but I want to be single Buck 2.0.
Like, if I'd come in here with Abby, I would never have noticed that blonde over there, licking the salted rim of her margarita glass while she maintains strong, intimate eye contact.
Okay, is that really happening?
Say I go over there, right?
I, uh...I talk to her, I make a joke, she smiles, we both laugh.
Our-our shoulders touch, there's a moment, I lean in a little closer, she doesn't resist.
One drink, two compliments later, we end up in bed together having totally meaningless sex.
Yeah, that sounds awful.
I just...I don't want to be that guy again.
So don't be.
What can I get for you?
Ah, just, uh, two IPAs, please.
And a glass of chardonnay.
Gotcha.
Who's the wine for?
Maddie. She was parking.
Uh, you invited my sister?
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I don't know why I get on the freeway. I always regret it.
Because you are an eternal optimist, that's why.
That's true.
Are you hungry?
Oh, yeah, should we get that thing we got last time?
Uh, last time?
Here we go.
Ah, thank you.
A Celine Deion Sanders combo platter, please.
Oh. Good choice.
Ah. Why, thank you.
Thank you.
Cheers. Cheers.
MICHAEL: Now, I think everyone at this table has been a recipient of that, uh, Athena look.
Except for Glenn.
MAY: Usually it means you're gonna be yelled at.
Or grounded.
Or, in this case, arrested.
(laughter) What was she charged with?
Assault with a firearm, gross negligence in the discharge of a firearm, brandishing a weapon, trespassing, indecent exposure, delaying a police officer and failure to obey a regulatory sign.
MICHAEL: Wow.
Is there anything you didn't charge her with?
Well, she did manage not to kill anyone.
MAY: Hold on.
Who'd she assault?
Buck.
Pointing a firearm at someone is considered an assault, according to Penal Code 245.
I don't think Buck'd mind if you guys drop those charges.
He felt kind of bad for Lola.
MICHAEL: It was a stupid thing to do.
But I don't know, you know? Kind of sounds romantic, just to lay yourself down for the world to see.
ATHENA: A candlelight dinner is a romantic gesture, not a hostage situation 40 feet in the air.
Well, she did risk everything for love.
(exhales) You-you have to admire her creativity, if nothing else. And she did get her happy ending, sort of.
Then Mom arrested her.
Mm-hmm. (chuckles) I'm with Athena on this one.
When I saw that news story, all-all I could think about were the million different ways it could've ended badly.
Like, there could've been a pile-up.
BOBBY: Mm-hmm.
Or one of those bullets might've ricocheted.
What if someone had a real emergency and help couldn't get to them because the freeway was shut down? I mean, you guys did a great job, but you also got pretty lucky.
Thank you, Glenn. You're the only one who gets the big picture.
Ooh, would you like some more wine?
Sure. It's...What is it? It's very good.
Oh, I have some more in the kitchen.
It was recommended to me.
Okay.
Well, I don't know much about wines, but I know what I like.
Well, neither do I, but I found this great, uh, wine shop that...Oh, the owner's terrific.
Okay.
Oh, that's great.
Oh.
*
* Lady, when I met you there was peace unknown *
* I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb *
* I was soft inside * There was somethin' going on *
* Tender love is blind * It requires a dedication Uh, what's this?
Bourbon, neat.
The lady said real heroes don't drink pale ale.
CHIMNEY and MADDIE: * We ride it together, uh-huh * Makin' love with each other, uh-huh * (whooping, whistling) * Islands in the stream * That is what we are * No one in-between * How can we be wrong * Sail away with me * To another world, and we rely...* I see Chimney's got a girlfriend.
No. No, he does not. Uh, that-that's my sister.
Oh. Sorry.
They're kind of good.
Yeah, I know, right?
It's, uh, it's weird.
So, hey, what-what's a-a fancy TV reporter like you doing in a badge and ladder joint like this?
Stalking you, of course. (chuckles) I'm kidding. The station is right around the corner, and I like to keep my ear to the ground.
What about you?
You come here a lot?
Um, I-I used to, um, or places like it.
I-I haven't in a while.
Why?
I was in a pretty serious relationship, uh, but that's over now, I guess.
You're not sure?
I'm-I'm pretty sure.
I'm actually even thinking about...dipping my toe back into the dating game.
Just your toe?
* In love forever (chuckles) * We can ride it together, ah-ah...* Um...I'm just trying to be responsible and well-behaved.
You know, take it slow and-and do it right.
* Sail away with me To restraint.
* To another world...
(chuckles) To restraint.
* Islands in the stream * That is what we are * No one in-between * How can we be wrong * Sail away with me to another world *
* And we'll rely on each other, uh-huh *
* From one lover to another * Uh-huh.
(Taylor sighs) (sniffling) You ready, baby bear?
(laughing): Oh, I love you, boo boo.
Love you, too.
Mmm.
Let's go. (sniffles) (woman laughs) This is Ruth at the Gas-N-Sip at San Fernando and Vineland.
Our store is about to be robbed.
Again.
Man and woman. Seen the guy before.
He buys his lottery tickets here.
He calls himself "Harley." They're coming in.
Armed.
(door bangs open) Nobody move! It's a stick-up!
Cash register, baby bear.
WOMAN: Okay, boo boo.
Don't move!
Stay put, Earl. We're being robbed.
Again?
Give her the cash!
WOMAN: Fill it up. (panting) Hurry up.
(register dings) I know it's you, Harley.
Is this Margie or Darlene?
Boo Boo, what's she talking about?
Oh, a new one. He call you "baby bear," too?
You...Shut up, you!
Boo boo, how many baby bears are there?
Just you!
(grunting) You're the only baby bear.
(grunting) Earl, don't be an idiot!
Boo you!
(groaning) Just let him go, Earl.
Oh, shoot! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(grunts) (siren chirps, siren wails) (grunting) (grunting) OFFICER (on bullhorn): We've got you surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
Ow! Dumbass.
(grunts) (groaning) Who's the dumbass now?
(groaning) (creaking) You have a back door?
RUTH: Locked.
Ain't getting out that way.
727-L-30 request R. A. unit to the Gas-N-Sip on San Fernando.
I have a suspect about to be in need of medical attention.
(indistinct dispatcher response) Aah!
(grunts) (siren wailing) BOBBY: Seriously, you're telling me Taylor Kelly, the reporter?
Yeah.
I didn't know you two were seeing each other.
We're not. I ran into her in this bar, we're hanging out, and next thing I know, we're having sex in the bathroom.
I...kind of feel weird about it.
Yeah, which part?
I just thought I'd stopped being that guy.
I thought Abby had changed me.
I'm single for, like, a day, and I'm right back at it?
Well, Buck, you've been single for months.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
Bonnie and Clyde meets Dumb and Dumber.
EDDIE: He seems fine.
Pupils are dilated. Definitely high on something.
Well, I'll try to contain my shock.
Get him out of here.
Stay strong, baby bear.
I'm not your baby bear, jackass.
Men are the worst, right?
(scoffs) You're asking the wrong girl.
I really like her, you know, and not just 'cause she's a redhead, but now if I do want to call and, you know, ask her out, she's gonna think I'm only after one thing.
You are only after one thing. Jerk.
You don't even know me.
You're a man. I know enough.
She's been read her rights. I'll meet y'all at the hospital.
Can I get a little something for the pain?
Pretty sure you took that before you walked in here.
They're gonna take you to the hospital, Earl.
I'm fine, really.
BOBBY: Sir, we heard you took quite a tumble.
We'd feel a lot better if you got checked out.
You've already been a hero once today, Earl. Don't push your luck.
You thought I was being heroic?
Well...yeah.
A bit stupid, but heroic.
I was only thinking of you, Ruth.
Next time, let 'em keep the till.
Kind of like having you around.
(Buck sighs) Long day?
Well, you know, the long days are the ones without a car chase.
Yeah, Cap always says it's strange to hope for boring, but...we do.
I'm just trying to get people not to change the channel at the words, "city council." (chuckles) Why?
You got a story for me?
How about "Firefighter Acts Like a Pig"?
Um, the other night, w-we were drinking, and I...
I don't know, I...
I was working through some stuff.
I-I just, I don't want you to feel...
Buck. Did you come here to apologize?
I-I just don't want you to feel used or-or taken advantage of.
Because I respect you, you know? I-I do. You're a professional, and th-that guy, that's not me.
It used to be me.
I'm a grown woman, Buck.
And I'm the one who sent you the drink, remember?
(chuckles) Uh, fair enough.
I guess I can take karaoke bathroom off my bucket list.
Okay.
So you want to grab a drink?
Mm. Some other time, maybe?
I got a piece I got to cut.
The Burbank Library is getting a new mural.
(chuckles) Yep, have a good night.
(mutters) What about a news van?
Where's that on your bucket list?
* Every kiss is a door Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. I-I don't want you to think I don't respect you.
Yeah, yeah. I'll deal with it.
All right.
* If a touch is a key (phone dinging) * Keep on twisting * Keep unlocking, keep on turning me *
* Let me in Oh.
Sorry, stud, I got to run.
Five-alarm fire in Brentwood.
Wait, y-you're going to a fire?
Ironic, huh? Sorry.
I got your text.
Then let's hustle it up.
Hey.
Hey.
* Break it then you buy it TAYLOR: Go.
(engine starts) TAYLOR: Thanks, Buck.
Call me?
* You gon' love it if you try it *
* Got you hooked, now you're caught up. * (sirens wailing) What do we got?
ATHENA: Couple of newlyweds.
Driver's Paul Williams.
No ID on the passenger.
Another car drifted into their lane, the driver tried to avoid getting hit, car went off the road.
Bobby, it's bad. Car's wrapped tight around that tree.
BOBBY: Come on, guys, hustle up. Driver's name is Paul.
BUCK: Damn, the tree's folded right into the car.
Paul, can you hear me?
(firemen grunting) BOBBY: Eddie, see if you can reach her.
EDDIE: I got a pulse. She's alive.
I don't have a clear path to the groom.
Cap, can you get in from your side?
Negative.
Hen, Chim, we're gonna need Jaws.
(on radio): Two passengers in bad shape.
One confirmed alive.
No access to the other.
BUCK: Paul! Can you hear me?
It's LAFD.
(Paul moans) I got him. I hear him. He's alive.
BOBBY: All right. Make that two. Both alive.
Let's keep 'em that way, guys.
(grunts) Take that.
Okay, pull her out!
CHIMNEY: It's not good.
BOBBY: All right. All right, Chim.
HEN: Up.
BOBBY: All right, be careful with her.
Okay, I got an open femoral fracture, right leg.
And probably a broken pelvis.
Cap, we got to move her!
On three. One, two, three.
BOBBY: It's getting dark.
Let's get some lights down here and put a step on it.
EDDIE: Hang in there, Paul. We're gonna get you out.
CHIMNEY: You ready? Damn, there's a much tree here as car.
Yep.
BOBBY: Easy.
EDDIE: Easy, fellas.
He's breathing shallow.
Pulse is weak, he's lost a lot of blood.
So...tired.
EDDIE: No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, tell me about Katy. How'd you guys meet, huh?
Summer camp.
Yeah?
We were...six.
He's running out of time. What's the plan?
Still working on it. It's like this thing went through a crusher with him still inside.
W-We can't just cut him out.
Well, if we can't cut him out of the car...
let's get rid of the car.
All right, guys, let's go.
One end to the fire truck, the other end to the tow truck.
CHIMNEY: All right.
BOBBY: Let's pull this thing apart.
All right.
Got it? All right.
Yeah.
You really think this is gonna work?
It's all we got.
All right, Eddie, Chim. Clear the vehicle.
We secure?
Yep.
All right. Set? Set?
All right, let's go!
More.
Slow.
Careful.
All right, we got it. Let's go!
Body board.
Let's get you out of here, buddy.
(grunting) (groaning, whimpering) All right.
One, two, three, up.
PAUL: Katy?
We're taking you to her now, buddy.
Can't believe you got him out alive.
When I saw that car...
I know. Me too.
Tow trucks.
How did you even come up with that?
"What God has put together, let no man put asunder." The wedding ceremony.
Well, that was some divine inspiration.
Hey, even the big guy's a sucker for a love story.
(sirens chirp, vehicles departing) Wait -- a news van?
Don't other people use that?
(knocking) What if you get caught?
She could get fired.
Your brother sure did.
Hi.
CHIMNEY: Oh, he didn't tell you about the time he stole a fire truck from work so he could have sex in it?
Ugh.
Thank you for that.
CHIMNEY: Anytime, roomie.
MADDIE: Damn it. They didn't put it in here again.
CHIMNEY: Oh, uh...
(sighs) Ta-da.
You made me hot mustard.
I just can't anymore, with the whole sad face every time they forget it, so...
MADDIE: I know.
Anyway, uh, why so much food?
Uh, it's Buffriday.
Buffet Fridays.
It's the one day we indulge your sister's complete inability to choose what she's in the mood for.
Yeah, so we order everything.
And, because of your sister's hatred for leftovers, I don't have to buy groceries.
It's a win-win situation.
Uh, let's go back to you stealing a hook and ladder for a hookup.
It's your fault. You know, you always told me to go after what I wanted.
Be confident. Girls aren't scary.
Um, you were 11. Don't you have impulse control?
And not sure that's the problem.
All I'm saying is she's beautiful, she's cool.
And then she left me standing in a parking lot.
Yeah, I'm feeling this is a little more karmic.
Chickens coming home to roost.
(laughs) You've been Bucked.
Buck 2.0 has found himself a Buckette 1.0.
Dude, you're dating yourself.
We're not dating, okay?
But you two are.
You guys are...
dating each other.
(both laugh) That's crazy. We're...
Friends who hang out.
Yeah. Just hanging out.
No. Y-You're always talking or texting each other.
You sing karaoke together.
You do Buffridays, you finish each other's sentences.
Guys, come on, you're a couple.
Wh-When did...
(phone vibrates) (sighs) Yeah, this is Buck.
Oh, uh...
Hey.
How-how you doing?
Uh, good. Good.
Um, coffee.
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
I-I have a shift tomorrow, and...
Yeah. I-I will.
All right. All right.
Good-bye.
Being Buck 2.0 sucks.
Happy anniversary, love.
Ah.
To all our many adventures.
And the many yet to come.
It's been a long life and a short marriage.
For once, in both, could you do a damn dish?
(chuckles) Mm.
* Strictly business * Nothing more * As I held the door * Held the door *
* What a saint walked in * Ah-ah, ah *
* As two hears started dancing * A new story begins (sighs) * Oh, my poor soul * Starts flying like * A cannonball * What goes up * Must come down * Take my advice * And run while you still * Can *
* To the races * Got my love jumpstarted * The only one I want is you * Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh *
* Say it again, hey *
* I hear the bells and they're ringing already *
* Four kids and a big ol' wedding *
* Singin', you...*
* Say it again *
* Hey *
* Now, as I make the long walk home *
* You got me feeling like an overdose, singing *
* You...
* Hey, don't act surprised *
* A goldfish wouldn't love you twice *
* And your gravity * My depravity * Won't take my advice *
* I never run * While I still * Can *
* To the races * Got my love jumpstarted * The only one I want is * You...
* Hey *
* I hear the bells * And they're ringing already *
* Four kids and a big ol' wedding, singing *
* You...
* Say it again *
* Then my heart starts attackin' and the arteries clappin' *
* Trappin' all the bits of poison in the mornin' *
* I was sure that she was slippin' me, damn, maybe *
* What goes up * Must come down * Take my advice * And run * While you still...
Shall we add...
another memory to the collection?
(chuckles) Hmm?
It's a beautiful day.
Hmm. Yeah.
(chuckles) Thomas, we're stopping at the studio to have these digitized.
For the posterity of online narcissism.
Uh-oh.
What now?
I've forgotten the bloody helmets.
(chuckles): Oh.
(scoffs) Eh.
Paper.
Sir, can you tell me exactly what happened?
My husband.
He was outside, and-and the car must have...
I don't know, it-it...it rolled.
Perhaps I should move the car.
Sir, I am being told that you should not move the vehicle.
Just leave everything as it is.
He's not breathing!
Help is on the way.
He can't go.
He's my heart, my everything.
When we got married...
we thought, what the hell, we have so little life left, we might as well live.
That was Mitchell, always...daring the clock.
And me, I always followed along.
All those foolish things we did.
We only ever wanted to...
to go together.
That's love.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
I guess I can only hope to find something that good.
You don't find it, son.
You make it.
(sighs) Son, you mind if I have just a few moments alone with him?
Of course.
It's no problem. Here.
My sweet Mitchell.
Thomas?
Uh, E-Eddie! Cap! Come here.
I-I don't know what happened.
He was just talking, he was responsive, and then...
BOBBY: All right, start compressions.
Stay with us, Thomas.
Go, go, go.
Come on, Thomas. Come on.
Stay with me. Come on.
Come on, Thomas. Come on.
Buck.
He's gone, kid.
That's love.
(indistinct chatter) MAN: 911. What's your emergency?
Oh, excuse me, um, I'm looking for Maddie Buckley.
Um...Kendall.
Thanks.
(clears throat) Hey.
Oh, my God. Is Buck okay?
Yeah.
No. I'm sorry. Yes, uh, Buck is fine.
Uh, he's an idiot, but he's fine.
I just came to check on you, because...
we really haven't talked.
Yeah. It's okay. I...
Buck was just being stupid.
My life is a work in progress.
It's a mess.
I wouldn't expect anyone to want to take that on.
That's not it.
Not at all, actually.
Uh...
I really care about you.
Uh, I just didn't want you to feel pressured, that I was pushing you to something that you're not ready for.
You never pushed.
(chuckles) Good.
Um, and I also wanted you to know that...
I'm not worried about your life before.
I mean, I hate that it happened, but...
that would never scare me off.
I might take you up on that.
Someday.
(chuckles softly) Good. 'Cause my calendar's...
wide open.
What's the occasion?
Well, we've both been so busy, I thought...
we should spend a nice evening at home, just the two of us.
* Ooh, oh, oh...
You are definitely a keeper.
That's the occasion.
* This will be * An everlasting love You made it!
* This will be...
Hey. Hi.
Uh...wh....you change your hair?
Yeah. Well, after the earthquake and almost dying twice -- it makes you reevaluate a few things.
So, back to my roots. (laughs) That looks great.
Thanks.
I-I wasn't sure if you were gonna show.
You seemed a little hesitant on the phone.
Yeah. Um...
Buck 1.0...
wouldn't have thought twice about it.
Buck 2.0 has to ask: you...you didn't call me 'cause you felt some kind of weird debt, right?
Me-me saving your life and all.
Oh, is that the way you remember it?
'Cause I-I seem to remember Eddie catching me as I was falling out the window.
(chuckles) Um, I-I told him to do that.
Wow, maybe I should have called him.
(both laugh) Well, I'm-I'm glad you didn't.
Come on.
I, um, I already got us a table.
So, hey, is there a reason why you're referring to yourself as Buck 1 and 2.0?
It's-it's a long story.
MADDIE: Romeo and Juliet.
Antony and Cleopatra.
Lancelot and Guinevere.
Great love stories that started with a bang and ended in tragedy.
In the real world, no one's life is that linear.
We fall in and out of love.
* You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of *
* And no one...
We take it for granted.
Or find it where we least expect it.
* You and me, yes, sirree
Some relationships can seem easy from the start...
* And kissing and pleasing, together forever *
* Through rain or whatever 
...and others can be faced with tremendous obstacles.
* So long as I'm living, true love I'll be giving *
* To you I'll be serving, 'cause you're so deserving, hey *
* You're so deserving...*
We root for love to conquer all, but we also root for a comeback.
* Oh, love People who have been knocked down by life and get back up on their feet.
Who learn from the mistakes that they've made and grow into better, more complete human beings.
* Love, love * From now on
So maybe the greatest love stories aren't the ones that end in tragedies.
Maybe they're the ones that start with a second chance.
* From now on * From now on, yeah * From now on * From now on, from now on.
@@@@@@
HEN: First responders are born twice.
The first time is when they come into the world.
The second is the day when they make the choice to spend their lives running towards the danger.
To risk everything to make sure that you get home safe to the people you love.
My name is Henrietta Wilson.
And this is my story.
DR. GORDON: Don't worry.
She'll be here.
What can I say?
I have a type.
STEVEN: Okay, fine.
Some doctors like golf, some like gentlemen's clubs, some like, uh, Lakers tickets.
It's my job to know what makes you happy.
Spoken like a true pusher.
(soft laughter) So, is she into guys?
I mean, what's her story?
What's whose story?
(soft laughter) We should order that nice wine, unless they're pulling in the reins on your expense account.
Ah, since the meltdown in '08, everybody's been cutting back.
I talk to my buddies in finance and real estate.
They are all flying coach and having client meetings at Applebee's.
(laughter) But not us. Pharma is soaring.
Well, nothing helps the bottom line like a bunch of depressed folks, right?
(laughter) Well, Hen, you know the, uh, specs on this drug.
Why don't you tell them why it's worth the cost?
Well, gentlemen, we are seeing a 14% decrease in typical side effects from all the other antidepressants on the market.
Weight gain or loss, sleep dysfunction, loss of sex drive.
You know, my patients always ask for the generic. It's cheaper.
If it's between being able to afford the pill or no pill at all?
Yeah, I think you should probably prescribe generic.
Or maybe get your patients to go for a walk, or maybe stop the processed food before popping a pill.
Well..
(chuckles) You have such a warm and generous heart.
I mean, that's very unusual for a pharma rep.
Tell me more about you.
I can tell you that I don't like to be touched without an invitation, and when people invade my space, sometimes I pin their hand to the table with their own steak knife.
(laughter) STEVEN: Hey, my office will send over the samples first thing, okay?
Hey, we'll talk soon.
What the hell was that?
They're gonna buy.
We were building and cultivating our relationship, right?
I mean, that's our job.
We're selling antidepressants, Steven, not me.
Do you even like this job?
Because I got to tell you, you don't act like it.
You know, I took this job because I convinced myself that I'll be helping people if I could get them the medicine that they needed.
But that was, that was just a story I was telling myself.
Do I like this job?
Hell no.
I hate it.
This is not me. None of this is me.
So, what are you trying to say?
I quit.
What?
I have just never seen someone set their entire life on fire before.
(car door closes) (clock ticking) (exhales) So, what's it say?
What kind of job should I be doing?
Is it that bad?
The test only works if you give honest answers.
I was.
I feel like all your answers were for me.
That you wrote down things that you thought you were supposed to say.
(laughs softly) I feel like that's been my problem my whole life.
Not that I don't speak my mind.
You can ask my mom, my girlfriend, or any boss that I've ever had about that, but in terms of the jobs that I've taken, they weren't what I wanted.
They were just what I felt like I was supposed to be doing at the time.
So let me ask you a question.
What is it that you hate, more than anything else?
What is it that drives you absolutely bananas?
Bullies.
Bullies?
Yeah.
They find people at their weakest, their most vulnerable, and attack.
Like, how, how do you offer someone, who's already down on their knees, a fist when what they need is a hand?
So you feel a desire to protect the vulnerable.
Like a vigilante or something?
Might be fun. I mean, the hours suck and the benefits are terrible.
(stifled laugh) (both laugh) You know, you don't need a test to find out what you're meant to do.
You have a fire within.
(inhales, grunts) (exhales) Are you okay?
I slept wrong last night.
And I've had this pain all day.
Where were we?
You have a fire, a passion, a purpose.
And I know this is gonna sound cliché, but there's a voice inside of us that, when we listen to it, when we quiet ourselves and just listen, all will be well.
All will be revealed...
(gasps) Oh, Stacey!
Oh, hell no.
(phone beeps, line rings) HEN: Hi, um...
PARAMEDIC: We'll get it from here.
Let Dispatch know we're en route.
She's gonna be okay, right?
Just fine, thanks to you.
Me?
Starting CPR that quick makes all the difference.
Probably saved her life.
I was a lifeguard one summer as a kid.
Must have been a good one.
Even people with training tend to panic when they're confronted by the real thing.
Nice job.
HEN: It was like this total rush came over me.
I just knew exactly what to do, and I did it, I saved her.
I'm so proud of you, baby.
You never cease to amaze me.
Man, I walked into her office this morning completely unsure of what I wanted to do with my life.
And now, I mean, what if I found it?
What if you found what?
That thing. My purpose.
It was all the stuff Stacey was talking about.
I'm meant to save people's lives.
(laughs): Okay, I get that you're happy, you know, and-and you should be, but this was a, a fluke, right?
I mean, you can't believe it's some sign from God.
No, I think the sign came from God when I was 16 and I got shot and lived.
This is Him sending me a reminder.
You know what? Forget it.
Hey, no, I'm not being dismissive.
Today, my life finally came into focus.
It's that passion Stacey was talking about.
Yeah, well, passion is for rich people.
And the rest of us, we work.
Well, I'm tired of just working.
Well, paramedics, they go through tons of physical training.
I mean, it's like being a firefighter.
So I'll just -- I'll get in shape.
They're trying to recruit women now, you know?
Well, is that what you really want?
Want to be the black lesbian in the firehouse?
You know, you act like I'm-a march in there with a rainbow flag.
No one knows I'm a lesbian.
It's just firehouses are boys clubs, Hen.
And white boys clubs.
(stifled laugh) Well, then I'll just have to Rosa Parks the hell out of it, now, won't I?
(laughs softly) (sighs) You're really serious about this?
Yes.
I know it won't be easy.
But I at least got to try.
I need you to want this for me, too.
Hey, if you want it, I want it.
You know I will always support you.
Always.
You're like a hero.
(both laugh softly) THOMAS: Please find a seat.
You see this?
This is a Los Angeles Firefighter Paramedic patch.
You're all here because you want to wear one.
Most of you never will.
Okay, Wilson, show me what you got.

THOMAS: Congratulations.
You are now a Los Angeles Firefighter Paramedic.
(indistinct chatter in distance) GERRARD: Wilson.
Captain Gerrard?
Is that your real name, "Henrietta"?
Yes, sir.
What'd you do to your parents to deserve a name like that?
You're prettier than most, I'll give you that.
That's the women's locker room.
Don't mind the Ping-Pong table.
We'll move it out in a week if you're still here.
Yes, sir.
Guys.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
Who's this?
This is our new diversity hire.
For real?
You know, Cap, there's another way to say that.
Yeah.
GERRARD: We're screwed.
I'm Howie.
Hen.
Welcome to the 118.
(thunder rumbles) (reverse warning beeping) What'd you end up doing last night, Sal?
Gina dragged me to that vampire movie.
Twilight.
Seriously, that's what you did with your day off?
Wasn't half bad.
Honestly, I couldn't really tell you what happened in it, but that Kristen Stewart, oh, sweet mama.
I really like Kristen Stewart, too.
That's something I can get behind, know what I mean?
See, I don't get that.
She's too...brooding for me.
Too...
What, hot?
Maybe you're more of a Team Jacob kind of guy.
I don't even know what that means.
He's insinuating that you're gay.
(chuckling) GERRARD: Easy, boys.
(thunder rumbling) So, Hen, where you from?
Right here. L. A.
Seriously?
I would have bet money that you were from the East Coast.
You just kind of have that vibe.
(chuckles) Thank you for the compliment?
New York bitchiness is a compliment?
Whoa, nobody said anything like that, come on.
(scoffs) Where, exactly, in L. A., Henrietta?
Inglewood.
Inglewood.
(clears throat) You know what, Cap?
Uh, I've been meaning to ask you for next...
Eight women were recruited, and three of them make it through the academy.
106 stations in L. A., and we end up with one of the three.
What did I do to deserve this?
I can make an educated guess.
Watch yourself.
You know how much it costs to send a woman through the academy?
Same amount as it costs to put a man through, I imagine.
$82,000.
That's how much money taxpayers flush down the toilet with every failed female recruit.
I don't know. I say if you can make it through the training, you've earned your place.
Is that what you're worried about?
The taxpayers?
I'm worried about my life and putting the lives of my men in the hands of somebody who isn't up to the job.
And I'm worried about that poor son of a bitch who dies in a fire because you can't drag his ass out.
And this is all because the mayor wants to say that female recruitment is up.
Thatis what I'm worried about.
Okay, so that was kind of ugly.
(chuckles softly) Listen, the captain's just old-school. It's...
"Old" isn't the only word that comes to mind.
Look, I get what you're trying to do, but I don't need anybody carrying my load.
Hell, I'm smart enough to know that just by looking at you.
I just wanted to make sure you knew you weren't alone here.
Thank you.
(thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) Yeah, just, um...call me back.
Thanks.
Katy.
From work.
She, uh, says she knows someone who might be in the market for a roommate.
It's Arcadia, though.
Ugh.
Long as you don't move back in with the jerk.
Right. I never should've married him.
I should've listened to you.
Hey, not true.
I liked him for 48 hours: between the time you told me you were seeing someone and when I met him.
(sighs) Anyway...
you don't have to be in any hurry.
I kicked you out of your bedroom.
You leave for work an hour before me, and I don't want you waking my ass up when you use the bathroom.
Besides, it's nice in the sunroom when it's raining.
Which is, like, once a decade now.
Get some sleep.
You look like hell.
(sighs) (rumbling) (screams) (sirens wailing) (crying) Help!
My mom is buried, and I can't get her out.
She's trapped!
Come here, show me where your mom is.
(indistinct chatter) GERRARD: Guys, this structure's unstable.
Watch yourself.
KILEY: She was buried, and I found her, but I-I couldn't get her out.
Okay, we're gonna help your mom.
No, I want to be with her.
We just need you to stand back.
It's not safe in there, okay?
We need room to do our work. Please.
Ma'am, is there anybody else in the building?
No.
GERRARD: Shovels, gentlemen. Go, now!
Can't breathe.
I'm gonna give you some oxygen. I'm gonna help you breathe.
Okay?
It me, or this stuff got a mind of its own?
It's like that Steve McQueen movie.
Move it! Faster!
DIANNE: Where's Kiley?
Mom, I'm here.
The weight is constricting her chest, Captain.
We got to relieve the pressure on her lungs.
She's unconscious. Shallowing!
What's your mother's name?
Dianne.
Dianne, can you hear me?
GERRARD: Grab her hand. Pull!
(grunting) It's not the mud. Something's pinning her down.
Might be a piece of furniture.
CHIMNEY: This is like quicksand.
There's too much water.
Or not enough.
TOMMY: Not enough?
You guys, do you ever build sandcastles?
What happens when the tide comes in?
(panting) Where are you going?
To fetch a tide.
Wilson.
I love you, Mom.
This block is red-tagged, people!
Do not grab belongings, just keep moving.
Just keep moving.
HEN: Officer!
Can you feed me this line?
Where's the fire?
If this doesn't work, they're gonna burn me alive.
(firefighters speaking indistinctly) HEN: See, the water is loosening up the mud.
Hot damn, Wilson.
There's a log pinning her down.
I've got it. It's coming loose.
(overlapping chatter) Ready?
(speaking indistinctly) (crying) Give me a hand.
Okay.
KILEY: Mom?
Up.
(indistinct chatter) She wasn't supposed to be there in that room.
It's my fault.
Shh. It's not your fault.
It's not your fault, okay? It's nobody's fault.
Wilson.
She's gonna be DOA.
I know, sir.
And you're telling yourself what?
That you showed us up?
Well, congratulations.
You got her out with enough time for her daughter to watch her die.
Hey! My number.
I know a great bar on the Westside.
I'll settle for a good damn bridge to jump off right now.
I'd tell you it gets better, but you'd know I was lying. Call me.
I probably don't have to tell you to never let them see you cry.
No.
This ain't my first rodeo with men like him.
It's just the first time it happened in a job that I actually care about.
Yeah, I understand.
No, you don't.
Oh, you think they're inviting the Asian guy to their houses for barbecues and out for beers?
It's a big difference between being invisible and being a threat to their way of life.
And, yes, you're a minority, too, but you're still a man.
You benefit from a system that keeps women that look like me down.
You always make friends this easily?
(chuckles) GERRARD: Howie, quit screwing around in home ec class and get down here.
Some unsolicited advice: doesn't have to be me, but you should talk to someone about this.
You're not gonna survive if you take this on all by yourself, Hen.
(wolf whistle) That fender's a thing of beauty, Wilson.
Like a damn mirror.
It is almost as clean as the heads.
I'd let my granddaughters play with their Barbies in there.
I got a jump on it this morning, Captain.
Also cleaned the grease traps in the kitchen, inventoried the trucks, even got the cobwebs in the rafters.
Well, color me impressed.
(chuckles) What?
You remind me of myself when I was a rookie, stuck with all the chores.
No way I was gonna let down my captain. No way.
Other thing I did when I was a rookie was check up on my calls.
Wanted to find out how the people I treated turned out.
Stopped after a month or two.
There's no point.
But at first I had to know.
Bet you checked up on our mud lady, didn't you?
Yes.
And?
You were right, Captain.
She didn't make it.
Can't help but wonder if there's something we could have done differently.
It's hard to know.
But know this.
You ever go against my command again and you won't be cleaning out grease traps.
You'll be cleaning out your locker.
You missed a spot.
(alarm ringing) MAN (over P. A.): Attention, Station 118...
No. You're sitting this one out. I'm not ready to have you back in the field.
I want you to think about what I said while you're prepping dinner.
(reverse warning beeping) (truck door closes) (engine starts) (alarm ringing) (indistinct chatter) Here she is.
Hey, hey, hey. (laughs) Oh, so glad you called.
Oh.
(Athena chuckles) Oh!
Thanks for taking the time.
Oh, you don't have to thank me.
I remember what it was like starting out.
I invited a couple of folks to join us. Hope you don't mind.
Usually no, but I'm not really up for socializing.
This is Henrietta Wilson, the medic I was telling you about.
♪ Oh, I know that look.
Casey, the gay firefighter from the 115.
Mm-hmm.
This is Bethanne.
She works out of Rampart.
Three of us -- we get together once a month, swap war stories.
(laughing): Oh, so this is like a support group?
Oh, relax. It is not like AA.
(laughs) In fact, can we get another round over here, please?
(laughter) I would be expelled.
♪ Take me back, take me back...♪ Oh, they knew I was gay from the moment I walked in the door.
Now, never mind that I was the strongest guy in the firehouse.
All I ever wanted to be was a fireman.
You know, be a hero.
But it got so hard that my boyfriend told me to quit.
He told me to find a new dream.
Mm.
So I found a new boyfriend.
(laughter) BETHANNE: When I first started on patrol, there was this one officer.
He asked me if I knew how to fire my pistol.
I finished first in my class in the academy, and he asked me if I knew how to discharge my weapon.
Sometimes all it takes is one captain that should have retired ten years ago, who hasn't kept up with the times, to make life at work hell.
(Athena chuckles) What about you, Athena?
Oh. You know, I had this partner when I worked in South L. A.-- white, part of the old guard.
You know. He told me he always wanted to taste some chocolate, put his hand on my thigh.
I told him if he wanted chocolate, he should go to Carvel, and that if he ever touched me again, he'd taste it...
(mouth clenched): through a wired jaw.
(laughter) BETHANNE: Imagine how much harder it must have been for the people who came before us.
ATHENA: Mm. They were and we are the first responders of change, and change doesn't happen overnight, but it does happen.
So you know what you do.
You go in there tomorrow, you do your work.
Outshine them.
Hmm? Be you.
Go in there with your head up, because they don't get to determine who you are.
Youdecide that.
Drink to that.
ATHENA: Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
(laughter) ♪ We gon' burn the whole house down. ♪ (horn honking repeatedly) What the hell is this?
I have something to say to all of you.
I see you.
I saw you all the second I walked in that door.
All of you staring down at me.
I see you when you're hazing me, notlike all the other rookies.
Whether we're here in the house or-or-or we're out on a call, I'm watching you, I'm looking, I see you.
When you look at me, what do you see?
A woman?
A black woman?
A lesbian?
Good.
'Cause I'm all of those things.
And I don't expect you to love me.
I don't even ask you to like me.
All I ask is that when you look at me, see me.
See me the way I see you -- as a proud member of this department.
One of the rare few that chooses to spend their lives in service of those who are hurt and those who need to be saved.
Yes.
And one other thing.
If any of you have a problem with me being here, I suggest you ask for a transfer.
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.
(slow clap) (alarm ringing) MAN (over P. A.): Attention, Station 118.
Respond to a motor vehicle accident.
Unknown injuries.
CHIMNEY: Saved by the bell.
Let's go to work.
(siren wailing, horn honking) Did you see it happen?
Came up on it.
Just called it in.
Party limo, Captain.
Tommy, get the Jaws.
TOMMY: Roger that.
Fire department. We're gonna get you out.
How many you got in here?
There's five of us. Please hurry.

BOY: Oh, God.
It's okay, buddy. We got you.
Five people, plus the driver. Two conscious.
Driver's deceased!
Got it.
Hey.
CHIMNEY: What is that?
Yellow paint.
MAN: We got one!
(panting) MAN 2: All right, easy.
HEN: What do you remember?
One second, Mark was lighting the bong.
The next, we were upside down.
(crying): We were just having a party.
It was just a party.
Apply pressure.
Try to breathe easy. Breathe easy.
Captain!
Captain, I think there was another vehicle involved in the crash.
What are you talking about?
The bumper on the party limo has yellow paint on it.
Yellow paint...
CHIMNEY: She's right, Cap. I saw it, too.
It's all over the bumper.
What if there was another car here?
It would explain why the limo is so close to the road.
Maybe it hit something before it flipped over.
What does he say?
He doesn't remember anything.
The only way to know for sure is if we go down there and check.
I'm not diverting resources from a critical accident scene because you saw yellow paint.
Your observation is duly noted.
Now tend to your wounded. That's an order!
Hen! He'll have your job.
If I don't do this, I don't belong in this job.
He's stable and ready to move.
For the record, I thought that was a pretty good speech.
You know what pisses me off about all this?
What?
The rain.
I had it ordered stopped a half hour ago.
I guess you got as much pull around here as I do.
More flowers.
CHIMNEY: Great. We can use them at our funeral.
HEN: Flower vendor. He probably finished up his day, was heading home, and got hit.
Look, Howie, it's a shoe.
Wilson!
Here!
I got him. I got him.
I got him.
(Hen coughing) No pulse.
He's hypothermic.
He's not breathing. Starting compressions.
(panting) This is EM-2 to unit 104.
We have a male drowning victim, approximately eight to ten years old.
Location is approximately 80 to 100 yards southeast of primary accident site.
Require immediate assistance for evac.

You did it.
(crying, laughing) (gasping) Is this gonna be a regular thing?
The crying?
(crying): It damn well could.

Please don't tell the other guys, okay?
(both laugh) Good job, Wilson.
(laughs) Okay.
(Hen sighs) SAL: Yo, Wilson.
Nice work yesterday.
Yeah.
We would have done a sweep and found that second car eventually.
But eventually would have been too late.
I just got lucky.
SAL: Screw that.
You're good.
(laughs) Hen, Captain wants to see you in his office.
(sighs) Well, it's been nice working with you.
Hey, you don't know what's gonna happen in there.
He hates me.
Not because of how good I do this job, just because of who I am.
(thunder rumbles) (exhales) (knocks) Firefighter Wilson.
I'm Commander Roose.
I know who you are, sir.
I remember you from the brochures about recruitment.
This is Captain Cooks.
Since you've started working here, we've received numerous complaints.
If I could just have a chance to just -- to defend myself.
Not about you.
It's about Captain Gerrard.
Wh-What?
I -- no, I, I never filed any complaints.
COOKS: Not from you, Firefighter Wilson, from your coworkers.
What? Who?
That information is privileged.
But let's just say, more than a few of your firefighters have your back.
Some of the complaints got pretty colorful.
One of your coworkers compared Captain Gerrard and his behavior to a particular condition best cured by Preparation H.
ROOSE: It's not just complaints we're receiving.
Your colleagues all have some pretty complimentary things to say about you.
You've made quite an impression.
(laughs) I-I had no idea.
I-I seriously thought that you guys were bringing me in here to...
to fire me.
ROOSE: Why would we do that?
You're the future of the LAFD.
Until we find Captain Gerrard's permanent replacement, Captain Cooks here is going to assume leadership of the 118.
Welcome aboard, sir.
You, too, Firefighter Wilson.
Hen.
Hen.
Did you know what was going on in there before you sent me in?
(laughs) You set me up.
That's revenge for you making it so hard to be friends with you.
♪ To fan the flame Thanks for sticking it out with me.
And thanks for following me down that hillside.
The first of many, I'm sure.
(alarm ringing) MAN: Attention, Station 118.
Traffic accident with injuries.
(continues indistinctly) ♪ Is it all ♪ So easy...
HEN: We are born with innocence.
Then, as we grow, we are cursed with a question: "Why?" Why are we here?
Is it all just chaos, or do we have a purpose?
I was one of the lucky ones who found an answer to that question.
The curse was lifted and replaced with the gift of certainty.
Why am I here?
Because when you are scared, when you are hurt, and when you're in the wrong place at the wrong time and the smoke is too thick to breathe or it hurts too much to move or it looks like you might lose someone you love, when it's your turn to have the worst day of your life...
♪ It was all...I am here to be the first one there to help.
I am here to stand between you and the chaos.
I am a first responder.
That is my purpose.
And I'm always just a phone call away.
@@@@@@
("It's Beginning to Look a Lot like Christmas" playing) Thank you.
* It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas *
I don't get it.
Every year. People flock to his house and take pictures. Never our house.
It's not fair. I worked just as hard as he did.
What does he have that I don't?
OLIVIA: Oh, I don't know, taste?
JOHN: He's bribing them with free food. Go make some cookies.
Let it go, John. Christmas isn't about competition.
Just be grateful for what we have.
No. I have a better idea.
* But the prettiest sight to see *
* Is the holly that will be * On your own front door We got hot chocolate, hot cider and everything.
(indistinct chatter) You want to see something good?
Get a load of this.
MAN: Look!
He's up on the roof.
* It's beginning to look...
Uh-huh.
You looking? You looking?
* Soon the bells will start (exhales) * And the thing that will make them ring *
* Is the carol that you sing * Right within your heart (screams) * It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. * It's this way.
(groaning) Sir, can you move at all?
It hurts.
Okay. Probably a good sign.
Just stay still. Can you tell me how this happened?
Snowman pushed me off the roof.
(groans) Blood pressure's 120/70. Respiration's good.
All right. Yeah.
Do we move him over a little bit?
Doesn't appear to be any spinal damage.
All right, let's get him on a backboard.
(whimpers, grunts) Oh, looks like the baby Jesus broke your fall.
That's a Christmas miracle.
BOBBY: You guys ready?
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
(camera clicks) (indistinct chatter) (camera clicks) Oh, look, John, you finally got your wish.
Everyone's taking pictures.
(cameras clicking) Ready to go.
This is the best Christmas ever.
Ready? One, two...
(bells jingle) (Athena laughs) That knot is the same size it was ten minutes ago.
Yeah, I'm beginning to think it's something mankind wasn't meant to tamper with.
Well, maybe you'll have better luck with your next project. (chuckles) Oh, Harry saw a YouTube review. He has been talking about nothing else for three months.
Been hiding it in the garage.
When we were kids, we got excited about lawn darts.
Lawn darts?
Yeah, you know, those metal spikes with the wings on them you'd toss across your lawn.
(chuckles) I think they stopped making them because there were so many injuries, but I loved them.
My brother was a madman. He'd throw them way up in the air, then he'd laugh at me while I freaked out, running around, not knowing where they were gonna come down.
I think this is a minimum two-hour assembly.
It's getting pretty late, so...
Maybe you could just sleep over.
We can make a night of it.
Hot chocolate, a little Nat King Cole.
Well, I like the sound of that.
Know what would be even better?
Hmm?
If you didn't have to sleep over at all 'cause you already lived here.
(chuckles) Wow.
(laughs) You look like you praying for a 911 call.
Oh, no, I'm not. I...
Well, maybe a little one. Cat in a tree.
(both chuckle) I just, you know, I get tired of having to say good night to you at the door and tired of sleeping alone in a bed made for two.
I want you in my life.
I know the idea of another family -- instant family -- probably rings a lot of bells for you after what happened.
No, 'Thena, it's not that.
You just...you just took me by surprise.
Look, I'm not trying to give you an ultimatum.
I mean, move in or else.
That's not me. That's not it.
I just wanted you to know that I was open to taking the next step.
* Hey, take a picture * Show me what's the news today *
* It's an addiction * It's a game I badly want to play *
* So raise the stakes, boy * And show me what...
(music stops) (grunts) Morning, roomie.
Yeah, about that...
(panting) (knock on door) BUCK: Hey.
Looks like you're stuck with me again.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I have a new air mattress waiting for you.
You saw this coming?
You didn't?
(both laugh) Oh, we suck at this.
Really?
'Cause I feel pretty good about how that went down.
(laughs): You know what I mean.
We say we're gonna talk and work things out, but we just keep ending up like this.
It's a different way of working things out.
SHANNON (chuckles): Mm-hmm.
You're getting the tree today?
Mm-hmm.
The annual tradition of convincing him that, no, a 16-foot tree does not fit in the house.
You know, I caved one year.
(laughs) That last Christmas before you got back.
He hadn't been feeling well, and...we missed you.
When Christopher looked up at that giant tree, I couldn't say no.
(laughs) Where'd you put it?
The backyard. (laughs) Oh, yeah.
Of course.
But we didn't have enough ornaments to cover it, so we just loaded it up with lights and ribbon.
And I got the sleeping bags out, and we laid under it, just staring up at the branches for hours.
Mm.
He must have loved that.
Yeah.
(both chuckle) (Eddie sighs) You know, he still won't tell me what he wants for Christmas.
I've tried everything.
Did you take him to see Santa?
You mean the creepy guy at the mall with a fake beard? No.
(laughs) Oh, my God.
You still haven't let that go.
Look, just because you got scared and threw up all over Santa, that doesn't mean...
First off, yeah, that was very wrong of my abuela to tell you that story.
And-and second, no.
I wasn't scared. I...
The old guy smelled bad, and I had a stomach flu.
Really? Two years in a row you had the stomach flu? Yeah?
Yeah.
(door opens) CHRISTOPHER: Daddy!
ISABEL: Eddito?
Are you here?
Why is he here? I thought you were picking him up.
I'll distract them. You-you head out the back.
Whoa, w-wait.
What?
What?
You want me to sneak out?
(knocking) That's our son out there.
Look, we've been trying to figure out how to tell him. Maybe this is the moment.
Daddy. Daddy.
Dad?
It's not the moment, okay?
You-you have to go. You have to go.
Hey. Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Thought I was supposed to pick you up at Abuela's.
ISABEL: Oh, he was so excited about decorating that he couldn't wait to get home.
Did you have company?
What?
Oh, you know, I'm not the best housekeeper.
Show...Hey, show me what you got.
ISABEL: We ended up with two Christmas trees.
He said, "This is Daddy, this is me." Yeah?
(chuckles): Aw.
Huh?
You loved this green one, didn't you?
Let's get this out of the way.
Okay.
Let me help you out, buddy.
("Wonderful Christmastime" by Paul McCartney playing) * Simply having a wonderful Christmastime * (alarm blaring) * Simply having a wonderful Christmastime *

I beg your pardon?
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Uh...
Sir, where are you calling from?
I'm trapped inside a Christmas present.
You're what, now?
I work at West L. A. Distro on Sepulveda.
I was pulling a double shift in the warehouse, and...
Ow. Oh, I'm bleeding.
Something must have hit me on the head.
I must have passed out in one of these boxes, and it got loaded somehow.
I think I'm on a truck.
Okay.
The West L. A. Distro on Sepulveda.
Tell me your name.
Brandon Skinner.
Okay, Brandon.
You're sealed in a box, and you think you're on a truck.
Yeah. I'm getting jostled pretty good in here.
Is it a cardboard box?
Yeah.
Can you punch or kick your way out of it?
Tried. I tried!
I've been shrink-wrapped.
I'm getting a little claustrophobic.
Brandon, my name is Maddie.
Listen to my voice, and just breathe.
I can't. I can't. There's no air.
Oh, God!
Brandon, there's air.
You're talking to me, so there's air.
Stay calm. We're gonna find you.
I'll contact the warehouse, see if we can track down the truck.
Brandon, do you know how long you've been in there?
No, I just came to.
It's difficult to breathe.
I think I'm gonna pass out again.
Okay.
I don't want you to talk a lot, but I need you to try and stay awake.
We're gonna have you home for Christmas.
Ha! I hope not.
Not unless this box is going to Seattle.
You're from Seattle?
Yeah.
Going down here for school.
My mom wanted me home for Christmas break.
She offered to pay for it, but she can't afford it.
I should probably call her in case you guys don't find me in time.
We're gonna find you.
Just stay with me.
JOSH: There are trucks leaving that facility every 20 minutes.
We're working with the warehouse to try and contact all the drivers.
BRANDON: It stopped. I think we stopped.
Hey! I'm in here! Help!
(muffled shouting) (forklift beeping) (muffled shouting continues) (siren wailing) How long's he been in the air?
Plane took off from LAX 18 minutes ago.
It was diverted to SoCal Airport.
18 minutes. It's nearly long enough to reach altitude.
It's not good. Cargo isn't pressurized or heated.
I thought coach was bad.
Hey, Chim, make sure we have oh-two and warming blankets standing by.
Copy that.
(sirens wailing) (fire truck horns honking) Put your lights on. Let's go, Chim.
Come on, let's move.
Oh, joy.
Well, it looks like we're opening presents early this year, huh?
Clock is ticking, guys. We got to find this kid.
Dispatch said he was having trouble breathing even before he went up in the air.
(ringtone playing) Wait. Did you guys hear that?
(ringtone continues playing) Stethoscope?
(ringtone plays louder) That's our guy!
Hey, get this shrink-wrap off.
Got it?
What do we got?
Yeah, I got him. He's in there. He's in there.
Okay.
(grunting) I see him. He doesn't look good.
He out?
Yeah.
BOBBY: Okay. Get the bear out.
Get the bear out, guys.
All right, come on.
You ready?
One, two, three.
(ringtone continues playing) Slide him up.
He's cold, Cap.
All right, get some blankets on him.
EDDIE: I don't have a pulse.
CHIMNEY: Starting compressions.
How's he doing, Eddie?
Still nothing.
Buck, switch.
All right, switching.
Come on out, Chim.
Hold for a pulse check.
Still nothing.
I got a pulse!
Temp's rising.
Welcome back, Brandon.
I'm not dead?
BOBBY: You're not dead.
(ringtone playing) Well, someone really wants to talk to you.
BRANDON: She told me not to answer it.
Who did?
Maddie. The 911 lady.
She said she would ring it for you to find me.
Maddie?
Chim?
Oh, fancy meeting you here.
(laughs) How's Brandon?
He's good.
He's here. Do you want to talk to him?
Oh, I do.
Hi, Brandon.
Thank you.
Thank you. (laughs) You're welcome.
I look like an ornament.
Better on the tree than under it, right?
* Santa Claus is comin' to town * * Santa Claus is comin' to town *
* You better watch out * You better not cry * You better not pout * I'm telling you why * Santa Claus is comin' to town...*
Thank you.
Shannon. What are you doing here?
You won't answer my texts or return my calls.
This is not the place.
Maybe it's the perfect place.
Thank you.
We can actually have a conversation that doesn't end up with us in bed.
* Gonna find out who's naughty and nice...*
Follow me.
* Santa Claus is comin' to town * * Oh, yeah, Santa Claus is comin' to town * * Santa Claus...
I can't do this here, not now.
Then where and when?
It's been almost two months, and right now, I feel even further away from him and from you than I ever did when we weren't speaking.
Are you ever gonna let me see Christopher?
Of course.
Eventually.
* You better not cry...
Does he know that I'm here?
I didn't want to confuse him.
Not until I was sure.
Of me? Because you seemed pretty sure when we started having sex again.
Is that how you see this? Some transaction?
What, you sleep with me so I let you see Christopher?
I thought it was a reconciliation.
Right up until the moment when...you hid me from our son.
I didn't know what else to do!
I didn't know what else to do.
And I'm not keeping you from our son like some kind of punishment.
Whatever I need to do to prove myself and to fix things, name it.
I am there.
But you and me and hiding it from him?
That is starting to make everything feel...more broken.
You keep looking to me like I have the answers.
I don't.
No. Just the power.
I'm the one who screwed up, the one who left.
I know I don't get to have a say.
So I'm following your lead.
But...where are we going?
When will you be able to forgive me?
I can forgive you.
I'm just not sure I can trust you.
(door opens, closes) Hey, so do you need help with Christmas dinner?
Oh. No.
Is-is Bobby working that day?
I don't know.
I mean...I did a thing the other night.
It was stupid, foolish -- hell, maybe it was right -- but either way, it was thoughtless.
Okay. Well, what happened?
I asked Bobby to move in.
Move in here?
So how did he take that?
Kind of like you right now.
L-Listen, I'm just standing here wrapping these packages.
How do you know how I'm taking it?
I know that face.
(sighs) You love him.
You're moving forward.
So am I.
I mean, it's good.
But it ain't easy.
(laughs) You know, things have been going so well lately that, um, I kind of let myself forget how complicated all this is.
Yeah.
When he's here, I'm joyful, when he's not, I'm lonely.
I thought maybe he felt the same.
Hey. Hey.
Now, Bobby lived a long time with a secret.
So did I.
Who you are on the other side of that -- I mean, it takes time to figure out.
But home isn't a place.
It's a people.
And he loves you, and he loves our children.
So, if this is meant to be, he will find his way home.
HEN: Have a good night, Cap.
Bobby?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, you have a good night.
(Bobby sighs) I don't know where to go.
Usually, I finish my shift, check in with Athena, ask her if she wants takeout, or she wants me to cook.
Oh, you guys get into a fight or something?
She asked me to move in.
I feel like if I show up, she's gonna want an answer, and if I don't, then...
Then it'll feel like an answer?
Yeah.
And I know how much it took for her to put that out there, and the last thing I want to do is hurt her.
(inhales deeply) Bobby...you guys deserve to be happy.
It would be great if that was together, but if it's not, if you...
if you don't see a future with her, you can't pretend that you do.
She's had enough of that.
You have to just tell her the truth.
Well, the truth is that I...felt panic.
Well, maybe that's your answer.
BUCK: Eddie's sleeping with her, but he's lying about it.
It's like he's having an affair with his own wife.
You don't think that's weird?
CHIMNEY: I think it's none of our business.
Now can we please focus on the trees?
Now, exactly how pissed off is Maddie?
Should I be shopping for a six-foot apology, or a 12?
Uh, pissed off at you for what?
For kicking you off of my couch and onto hers.
It's an air mattress, and she is fine.
If anything, I should be the one holding a grudge, which I will if you don't hurry up and pick a tree already.
Wait. Are you seriously googling Christmas trees?
I want to buy Maddie a gift, and I want it to be perfect.
I'm gonna go find someone to help us.
You stop overthinking and just pick one.
* It's the most wonderful time of the year * * There'll be much mistletoeing and hearts will be glowing *
* When loved ones are near * It's the most wonderful time of the year...*
I need your help here, Big Man.
Real cute.
* There'll be parties for hosting...*
Big Man like God?
Or Big Man in the Red Suit?
Blue suit, actually.
Santa Haraboji. It's a Korean thing.
Though I haven't really given him a shout-out since I was nine, but I had no idea there were so many different varieties of Christmas trees.
So it's an important purchase?
It's for a friend, but she really loves Christmas, and I want to surprise her.
A gift for the girlfriend. Nice.
No, it's not like that.
Uh, she had a rough year.
Couple of rough years, I guess.
This is our first Christmas together...as friends, and I really, really want it to be special.
I'd go with the noble fir.
It's a classic for a reason.
* Oh, the most wonderful...
All right. Thank you for your guidance.
Jason. Jason Bailey.
* Of the year.
All right.
Noble fir it is, Jason Bailey.
BUCK: Ho, ho, ho.
Surprise.
MADDIE: Oh.
Wow. A Christmas tree.
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
Buck said you didn't have one yet.
Uh, is this okay?
Is this the wrong kind of surprise?
No, no, no.
No. It's so sweet.
Really, I-I love that you did this.
You just didn't want it. That's okay.
I mean, we shouldn't have assumed.
I just really wasn't gonna do much Christmas this year, 'cause all of my decorations and stuff are back in Pennsylvania.
And that is why we bought everything you need.
We have lights, we have ornaments.
We even have...an angel high for on top of the tree.
No. Angels are creepy.
CHIMNEY: You know what, I think we might have overstepped.
Maddie should be able to pick out her own decorations.
We'll just, we'll just, we'll just bring this back to the store.
What are you talking about?
You can't return a tree.
Hey, come on. You always loved Christmas, right?
Ornaments, stockings, cookies. You made your own bows.
Yeah. I'm not really feeling the holiday this year, okay?
Well, no. (scoffs) No, it's not okay.
Come on, what's going on with you?
I don't want to talk about it.
CHIMNEY: Guys, it's fine.
You know what? (grunts) I'm just gonna...
take away the evidence before, uh, this turns into a crime scene, okay.
So you hate Christmas now?
Something else I can thank Doug for, huh?
No, I don't hate Christmas, but I'm starting not to like you very much, okay?
Just let it go.
Maddie...
You can't come into my house, Buck, and act this way.
"Come into my house"?
I'm your brother.
(arguing continues) Happy holidays.
(sighs) * With your Christmas of white * But I'll have a blue...
(sighs) Bah, humbug.
* Doo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh. *
HOST (over recording): Aloha and Merry Christmas.
Romance is in the air tonight here at Terri's Tiki Room, literally.
Be sure to steal a kiss or two under the mistle-drone and celebrate the season.
Drone photos of your magic moment are available.
Ask your server.
JENNA: You hooked up with Stacy of all people.
At least she knew what she wanted.
Do you, uh, know what you want?
Be right back with your apps.
HOST (over recording): Aloha and Merry Christmas.
You like apps. Tinder, Bumble, Match.
You're still on all of them.
Yeah. I'm on them because I'm single, and I'm single because you said so.
What I said was it was too soon for Christmas with your family.
You're a commitment-phobe and you were just looking for an excuse -- a reason to check out.
HOST: And don't forget Tuesdays are two-for-one Bahama Mama and all-you-can-eat sticky ginger chicken wing night at Terri's Tiki Room.
I needed a minute.
Things were moving too fast.
I'm not phobic.
I'm afraid.
Those mean the same thing.
(scoffs) What the hell are you afraid of?
This.
(screams) EDDIE: Anything?
Not yet.
It's not like it can roll.
Maybe it bounced.
Not that bad, right?
TRAVIS: No.
And they can, they can reattach it. Right?
Yeah, the cut looks pretty clean.
We'll find the tissue, pack it in ice.
There's an excellent chance you're gonna be good as new.
A-And even if they couldn't, I wouldn't care.
Might need to up your comfort game a little there, Romeo.
Look, I didn't mean to move too fast, but I just figured when you know something, you double down.
But then you backed off.
JENNA: And you ran away.
You pushed me away.
I told you, I got scared.
Because you didn't want to be with me.
Doesn't that mean I'm supposed to let you go?
Look, may-maybe she didn't want you to move on.
She just probably needed a minute.
Well, how was he supposed to know that?
All right. Okay. All right. Listen. Look.
People aren't afraid of what they know.
They're afraid of what they don't.
It's a hard thing to hand someone else the keys to your heart and your happiness.
And then you realize that losing them would mean losing a part of yourself.
BUCK: Hey. (grunts) Found it.
* Let it snow * It doesn't show signs of stopping * Sorry, man.
Oh, sorry.
* And I've brought some corn...*
That's your idea of a Christmas movie?
Holy crap. Jason...uh, Bailey.
(laughs): Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Die Hard is a holiday classic.
Really? I don't know.
I guess I always saw it as a movie about a guy trying to keep his marriage together...
with terrorists.
At Christmas.
So what are you doing here?
I thought you'd be up to your eyeballs in pine needles.
I'm just trying to find a gift for my special someone.
What about you? How did that tree go over?
Badly.
I'm not sure what to do.
I think I've really screwed things up.
Well, your boy McClane screwed things up with Holly, right?
More than once, if I recall.
But he won her back in the end, didn't he?
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna try again.
Uh, just this.
(Chimney sighs) What's up, man? You lose something?
(chuckles) Yeah, my wallet.
Oh, no.
Here, I got it. No, I got it.
No, it's okay.
Look, I'll just, um...
There you go.
And take that so you can get out of the parking structure.
No, it's probably in my car.
In case it's not.
I can't ask you to do that.
You didn't ask, I offered.
Thanks. You know, uh, I'll come to the lot and pay you back.
Don't worry about it.
It's kind of a miracle that I ran into you.
* Let it snow, let is snow (mimics Alan Rickman): It's Christmas, Theo.
It's the time of miracles.
* Let it snow.
CHIMNEY: Thank you very much.
EDDIE: I offered to wait in line with him, but he said this is, uh, private.
Christopher.
BUCK: I really admire that kid.
I love the way he always wants to do everything on his own.
EDDIE (laughs): Yeah.
So...not gonna say anything?
Nah. About what?
You know what about.
I figured it was none of my business.
It's not.
That's what I'm saying.
It just kind of happened, okay?
It's not like I planned it.
(chuckles) I never said you did.
I only even reached out to her because I needed her help getting Christopher into his new school.
Totally understandable.
We just kind of...
ended up in bed.
Ah, these things happen.
It's not like you're breaking any commandments.
You guys are still married.
Yeah.
I'm sneaking around behind my kid's back with his mother.
Christopher doesn't know?
I don't know what he knows.
These kids sense things, right?
The other day, I made her sneak out so he wouldn't see her there.
Trying to protect your kid.
I mean, she ran out on him, right?
I ran out first.
I ran out on both of them.
See, when Christopher was first diagnosed I was in Afghanistan.
Right at the end of my tour.
Instead of going back home...I reenlisted.
I told myself it was to pay the bills.
But you were running away, too.
Yeah. But I got to pretend like it was for a noble cause.
Serving my country.
But when Shannon broke, nobody thought she was a hero.
She just got called evil.
And now she wants back in his life.
Yeah.
So why don't you let her?
Seems like she's already back in yours.
That's...that's what's got me confused.
Would I be doing it for Christopher or for me?
I guess sex complicates everything.
(chuckles) You said it, brother.
Uh, hey.
How'd it go, pal?
It went great.
So what'd you ask for?
Can't tell.
Santa said he'd work on it.
Oh, man...
(Buck laughs) Let's go.
Ooh.
Wah. (laughs) You two have an adorable son.
(chuckles) Um...Thank you.
Dad. Is Santa real?
Hmm?
Is Santa real? Why?
Did someone say he wasn't?
What do you think?
Do you think he's real?
W-When you were gone, I asked Santa for you to come back, and you did.
When I was in Afghanistan?
You know, buddy, Christmas wishes aren't like birthday wishes. Yeah.
You can say them out loud and they'll still come true.
I asked him to find Mom. Will he?
He's sure gonna try.
So I asked Ms. Rangley and she said it was okay to FaceTime during the performance so you can see it.
Um, what time will it be over there in a half an hour?
I don't care what time it is. I'm not missing my little girl's first solo with the choir.
I miss you, Daddy.
It's been so long.
I know.
But you just go get ready, and I promise we'll be hugging real soon.
Yeah, in a month.
Break a leg.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Surprising her?
I've been traveling for 30 hours straight.
Every form of transport you can imagine.
Jeep, Humvee, APV, helicopter, 737, and now city bus, all to make it home in time to hear my little girl sing in the choir.
Is this bus usually on time?
I've got to make the crosstown connector and I don't want to miss it.
WOMAN: Relax.
The good Lord wouldn't let you miss such an important event after all you've done to get there.
CLEMENS: Hey.
Hey, you took that man's wallet.
Piss off, Top Gun.
That's the Navy, son.
I'm a Marine.
Now give that man back his wallet and I won't call the cops.
(horn honking) Let's see what we got.
I'll take the driver.
So, I don't know how, but we have mostly minor injuries, some cuts and bruises, except for this guy, and I don't know if he's gonna make it.
Sergeant.
That truck came out of nowhere, man.
Piece of glass clipped him in the neck.
Feels like it hit a major artery.
EDDIE: Carotid. You got your finger in the hole?
That's what we're trained to do.
I've seen it before, unfortunately.
Me, too. Where were you?
Leatherneck.
Ah. I was at Bagram.
Army?
Uh-huh.
Nobody's perfect.
Let's run the fluids wide open.
You mind keeping your finger there for a moment?
You don't have anywhere to be, right?
Right.
I'm good.
Okay.
(helicopter blades whirring) EDDIE: On three. One, two, three.
All right.
All right, let's move him out of here, guys.
All right, keep the pressure.
All right, he's stabilizing.
Is he gonna make it?
Thanks to you, Marine.
How you feeling?
I'm fine.
Anything else I can do?
We're good.
Thank you for your service. Literally.
(sighs) You got it.
All right, we'll take him.
I hear you have a show to get to, Marine.
Yeah. But I'm never gonna make it.
Oh, yes, you are.
Let's go.
(horn honking, siren wailing) Better hurry up and get dressed -- we're gonna be there before you know it.
I'm gonna cry. I-I know I'm gonna cry.
Those soldier reunion videos on YouTube always get me.
(horn honking) (microphone feedback) (gentle piano intro plays) HOPE: * I'll * Be home * For Christmas * Doo, doo, doo *
* You * Can plan * On me * Please * Have snow * And mistletoe * And presents * On * The tree * Christmas * Eve * Will find me * Ooh, ooh, ooh *

(cheering) * I'll * * Be home * * For Christmas * * If only *
Every time.
* In * * My dreams * * If only * * In * * My dreams...* (song ends)
("The Christmas Song" by Nat King Cole playing) * Chestnuts roasting...
Hi.
Glad you came.
* Jack Frost nipping
I wasn't sure.
* At your nose
I thought I scared you off.
I really shouldn't have sprung that on you like that.
I just, uh, I wasn't thinking.
Well, you were feeling.
You were speaking from your heart, which is something that I love about you.
Which brings me to this. Merry Christmas.
* And some mistletoe
Y-You don't want to wait till morning?
I don't want to wait another minute.
* Help to make the season bright *
(laughs) (gasps softly) Bobby!
You offered me a key. So...
* Find it hard to sleep tonight *
I don't want to take the next step.
I want to take every step, with you, for the rest of our lives. Marry me, Athena.
Bobby.
I know it might feel sudden and fast, but we both know how life works.
Yeah.
Life is fleeting and it's precious, and when you find happiness and you find somebody who fills your heart, gives you hope for the future and faith in yourself, you have...
Bobby! Yes!
Yes?
(softly): Yes.
You really said yes. It's a Christmas miracle.
Just put the damn ring on my finger.
* And so I'm offering...
Mm. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
* To kids from one * To 92 * Although * It's been said (alarm beeping) * Many times
Dad!
* Many ways
Dad? Wake up!
* Merry Christmas
It's Christmas!
* To you * * And so I'm * Offering
Mommy! Mommy!
* This simple phrase
(Shannon squeals) Oh! Merry Christmas, baby.
* To kids from one * To 92
I missed you so much.
* Although it's been said
I knew Santa could do it again.
* Many times, many ways * (laughter) * Merry Christmas * To you.
Okay, we've got turkey, ham and six different sides.
Forget about the food.
What you have here is taste!
I mean, I mean, I know they call diamonds rocks, but this is a rock star.
I mean, is your hand tired?
'Cause I could help you carry that, for a while, if you need a little help.
BOBBY: It is a promise to Athena and her family for a lifetime of happiness, love and all the home-cooked meals you can eat.
Oh, that's sweet.
But let's not forget it's also a big damn diamond.
(laughter) (doorbell rings) You got that?
Yeah.
All right.
Merry Christmas.
Ah. Thanks for inviting me.
I brought Christmas, and...I brought congratulations.
Ah, thank you. Well, you are always welcome.
Maddie didn't want to join us?
I think this year she needed a different kind of Christmas.
All right, well, come on in.
All right. I'm excited.
(knocking) Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy.
Chinese food and Die Hard, the greatest Christmas movie ever made.
I'm sorry.
About the tree. I shouldn't...
Whoa-ho-ho.
Christmas is supposed to be about feeling safe and warm with the people you care about; that's the gift.
What it's wrapped in doesn't matter.
Who needs a tree?
* Round yon virgin
Well...
I decided I do.
I didn't steal it. Someone left it on the sidewalk, and I didn't have a lot of time, so it's not perfect, but...
Well, who needs perfect?
It's, uh...it's beautiful.
So what made you change your mind?
MADDIE: The holidays with Doug, they weren't a celebration.
It was a performance.
You know, pretending to be a...happy couple that had it all.
I just didn't want to pretend this year.
But then I realized that he's taken enough from me.
I'm not gonna let him take one more thing, and I sure as hell am not gonna let him take Christmas.
Last year was my worst Christmas ever.
But maybe also my best, because that's the day I decided to leave.
Now, that is a good reason to deck the halls.
* Silent * Night * Holy * Night (object shatters) * Son of God * Love's pure light * Radiant * Beams * From Thy * Holy face * With * The dawn (footsteps approaching) * Of redeeming * Grace
Doug...
Shh.
I know you tried so hard.
It just wasn't right.
It wasn't perfect.
You'll get it right.
Someday you'll get it right.
(kisses)
@@@@@@
SADIE: My girlfriends keep telling me a new face won't win him back.
Who says I want him back? I don't. I want me back.
Actually, I want the 35-year-old version of me back.
You think you'll be able to knock 15 years or so off me?
Without a doubt.
Just don't make me look like a duck.
(power tool whirring) What are you planning to use on me?
They're just doing some construction next door.
Relax. Breathe normally.
Count backwards from ten, and when you wake up, you'll be ten years younger.
Fifteen.
(hammering outside) Ten, (echoing, distorting): nine, eight, seven...
(classical piano playing) Are we done?
Doctor? Mm.
How do I look?
Hello?
(screaming) (phone ringing in distance) CHIMNEY: What are we thinking? Gas leak?
HEN: Could be some pathogen.
World's a crazy place these days.
BOBBY: Negative for combustibles as of now.
Masks stay on for the duration.
BUCK: Where is everyone? It's too quiet.
Got one over here.
She's got a pulse.
Pupillary response...normal.
SADIE: Help! Please help!
Please help me.
Oh, help me. They're crushing me.
Okay, Buck, give me a hand over here.
Chimney, you check on her.
Wha-Wha-What's wrong?
Stop, stop, stop!
Don't touch your face. Don't touch your face.
What the...?
Ma'am, it just looks like the staff here just wasn't 100% done before they lost consciousness.
You're still under the effects of the general anesthesia, which is good.
Okay, we're gonna keep you nice and numb.
But I'm gonna need to put a cold compress on your face, okay?
Is there a stitch loose?
BOBBY: Look, you're probably gonna feel cold, but you're not gonna feel any pain.
We've got to preserve as much tissue as possible when we travel you to a hospital.
Tissue? Oh, my face is off!
My face is off!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Same symptoms over here, Cap.
She's sleeping like a baby, but she's stable.
(Sadie gasping) BOBBY: They run the anesthesia lines through the walls in these places, don't they?
What are you thinking, a leak or a rupture?
Yeah, then why isn't she out?
BOBBY: Looks like she's receiving oxygen from the nasal cannula.
Eddie, you copy?
Yeah, Cap.
What's your status?
Found a couple more patients in back.
Also stable.
I'm gonna send Chim your way.
You guys see if you can locate the tank supply room.
You turn anything off that's got a knob or a valve in this place.
A pipe must have busted, yeah?
Probably the construction guys.
You saw construction guys?
I heard 'em, right before I went under.
I don't hear anything now.
EDDIE: I got this guy over here.
Chimney, grab the guy on the table.
CHIMNEY: On it.
Sir, can you hear me?
Stable here.
This one's breathing.
(grunting) This guy won't budge.
EDDIE: Cap, found our leak.
Okay, let's see what we have here.
Plugging the leak now.
BOBBY: Copy that, Eddie.
CHIMNEY: Right. So there's that. Hey, Eddie, I need your help over here. Grab some tools.
What do you need? Saws? Jaws?
Wrench. We'll have to travel him with the blade.
Easy. Easy.
Okay, that's got to sting.
MAN (weakly): Measure twice, cut once.
(groaning) Just lie still, buddy, we got you.
EDDIE: Okay, we're good here. Let Mercy General know we're ten out.
Measure twice, cut...(groans) Make a hole. Critical.
Don't worry, we're gonna take you to the hospital and they will fix you right up.
You'll still get your new beginning with your new face.
I'd be happy if I could just have the old one back.
(door opens) We're here.
Uh, they're not here yet.
Ah.
Hey, you can still make your escape.
Uh, you know what, just put your stuff away before your grandparents get here.
Yeah.
Right?
Oh, this is nice.
Very, very impressive.
Well, impressive is what I'm going for, so thank you.
Can you stay? Will you join us?
Oh, hell no, thank you.
Beatrice has never been a fan of mine.
You have no earthly idea what is about to happen to you, do you? (laughs) Tell 'em I said hi.
We're here.
Oh, man.
HARRY: Grandma! Grandpa!
How I have missed these faces.
(laughs) You still here?
I thought you'd drop the kids and run.
Well, they wouldn't jump out of the car while it was still rolling.
Oh...
Remember, no matter what happens, they leave on Saturday.
(indistinct chatter) Beatrice, how you doing? It's good to see you.
Michael, what a pleasant surprise.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Uh, Mama, uh, Daddy, this is Bobby.
Hi.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Carter.
Oh, no need for that.
Christian names'll do. Call me Samuel.
Will do.
Boy, that's a good-looking spread. (chuckles) He living here already?
Uh, no, ma'am.
Not until after the wedding.
And it's a pleasure to finally meet you.
You're very...tall.
So, Michael, will your husband be joining us?
Oh, no.
Uh, Glenn and I aren't actually married.
Mm. Of course you're not married yet.
You're barely divorced.
Uh, Saturday, you said?
Mm-hmm.
There you go. Just keep that tight. Nice.
You are on fire with that sassy new haircut.
Sassy?
Yeah.
Okay, let's, uh, let's work on that two-three-two combo.
Okay, I want you to be ready with that devastating hook is you ever see Doug again.
Whoa. That is not why I'm doing this.
Really? You, uh, you don't want to kick your abusive ex's ass someday?
'Cause I would.
I'm not doing anything for Doug anymore, okay?
This is just the next chapter in Maddie's fresh start.
Come on, haircut, apartment, dispatcher of the month. I don't know if you heard.
About a thousand times. Come on.
Oh, is that what this is about? I'm thriving, and you can't handle it.
I'm great.
Oh, yeah, you're doing great.
You're still sleeping in my dining room.
By the way, what happened to Earthquake Girl?
Your trash talk sucks.
Ali's around.
We're taking it slow.
She's, uh, she's in New York on business.
Why is it that every girl you date wants to either flee the state of the country?
At least when I date someone, I date them.
What's your excuse?
What are you talking about?
Uh-huh.
How's Chimney?
(exhales) Chimney? We're friends.
Except, ooh, you want to date him.
I never told you that.
Oh, you didn't have to.
Your fists are saying it. Intensity and speed notched up, like, 20% the second I mentioned his name.
Okay, easy. Let me ask you this.
You're doing so well, you're-you're "thriving." Why can't you just date the guy?
CHIMNEY: I don't know.
I mean, we like the same things, we laugh at the same jokes.
Even better, she laughs at all mine, and I'm not even that funny.
You don't think she's seeing anybody else, do you?
No. I'm telling you, her ex really did a number on her.
I'm not saying he ruined her for anybody else, but...
Come on, man, no hook-ups?
No foreplay, nothing?
No.
Right now we're all awkward hugs and funny glances.
A screwball comedy without the screw?
Corner pocket.
CHIMNEY: Oh, too bad.
So, maybe it's time you moved on to greener pastures.
Take the hint.
Well, that's the thing about me.
I'm bad with hints. I even suck at Pictionary.
Yeah.
You know you've been singing the same sad song about this woman ever since we started coming here?
I'm starting to think I should have mailed that wallet back to you after I found it, instead of returning it in person and striking up this misguided friendship.
Well, honestly, the only reason I keep coming here with you is I know there was a $20 bill in that wallet when I lost it, and I'm just trying to win it back.
Ooh.
* Oh, yeah. *
TORRIE: Mom, you're not listening to me.
SHELLY: It is a little small, sure.
But it's a great school.
It's not small, Mom, it's tiny.
I want the real college experience.
Tailgates and football games. New scenery.
You want parties.
University of Miami is a party school.
I don't want parties, I want a fresh start.
A new beginning. That's why people go away to college, to leave behind the lame-ass they were in high school.
Honey, who called you a lame-ass?
(horn honking) Mom! Mom! Look out!
(tires screeching) (man screaming) (sirens wailing) (man screaming) (indistinct chatter) LAFD. Make room!
BUCK: What the hell?
WOMAN: Tiger shark.
We were transporting her for release into the wild.
Truck jackknifed.
Jaws!
Right.
Oh, right. Those Jaws. Jaws!
I'm on it.
(man grunting) (yelling) How'd his arm get in there?
Diego was trying to get what water was left in our pump system.
She can't breathe without it!
How much time does she have left?
Minutes.
Uh, do we wait that long or, just, you know...
No, no, don't kill her!
She's come so far. (grunts) All right, guys, we're gonna do this really carefully.
All right, come on. Let's get in there.
(man continues grunting) All right, let's get him transported, now!
Nice and easy.
Don't let her die.
Please.
CHIMNEY: Breathe easy. You're gonna be fine.
Let's get him up!
("Touch of Grey" by the Grateful Dead playing) * Must be getting early *
* The clocks are running late * * Paint by number morning sky * * Looks so phony * * Dawn is breaking everywhere *
(siren wailing) * Light a candle, curse the glare * * Draw the curtains, I don't care * * 'Cause it's all right * * I will get by *
* I will get by * * I will get by...* * I will survive *
All right, coming down quick.
Here we go.
Keep it steady.
A little more.
That's it. Keep it coming!
* Sorry that you feel that way...*
That's far enough.
Halt!
That's it, a little more slack.
* Touch of grey *
Careful, careful!
* I will get by *
Okay, she's down. She's in the water.
(quietly) Come on, swim.
You see her? Where is she?
* I will survive * (laughs) * We will get by *
Hey, too bad Diego is missing it!
He's not missing anything!
* We will get by...* * We will survive * * We will get by. *
I don't understand why your mother would reorganize the entire kitchen while we're at work.
Oh, she said it was impossible for her to find anything in this kitchen.
So she retaliated by making it impossible for us to find anything?
Found it.
Ah. Thank you.
Ooh, the dress is lovely.
Very elegant. (chuckles) Thank you.
Did you pick that out?
Yeah.
(Samuel muttering) What is this?
BOBBY: Oh, that is Harry's science project.
Michael had that conference, so I was helping him out with it.
Harry was supposed to put it away, but tell you what -- I will move it.
That boy has you wrapped around his finger.
You do know someday soon you're gonna have to go from being best buddy Bobby to stepdad Bobby.
You are right. I will have him put it away.
If you can help me find the damn cheese grater, please.
I'm sorry to interrupt, guys.
Hey, Harry. I need you to clear the table so we can eat.
Okay. In a minute.
No, not in a minute. Now.
Please.
Who are you to give orders?
They are not your children, and you are not their father.
I was very sorry to hear about your family's situation, but my grandchildren are not your consolation prize.
Kids.
I'm sorry, I...
(door closes in distance) Apologize, Mama.
BOBBY: It's all right, Athena, she doesn't have...
Yeah, she does.
If she wants to stay in this house tonight, she does.
(takes deep breath) I'm sorry I said that in front of the children.
You shouldn't have said it at all.
It is none of your business.
I am tired of you deciding what's my business, Athena.
You didn't tell me you were seeing this man, much less that he proposed.
Just like last year.
My baby May almost died, and you didn't say a word for over a month?
Because she is not your baby girl. She's mine.
And Michael and I needed to focus all of our energy and our attention on her, not you.
I would have wanted to help.
You never want to help.
You just want to tell me where I screwed up.
Because you never learn.
You just jump into everything without thinking it through, without considering the consequences.
"I'm gonna move to Los Angeles." "I'm gonna drop out of law school." "I'm gonna become a cop." "I'm gonna marry a gay man." "I'm gonna marry a white man." Sometimes I think it's a miracle those kids are alive...
(stammering) Okay, that's enough.
SAMUEL: Bobby's right.
Now, we all should just take a minute, let things calm down.
Sir, with all due respect, I have to say that your daughter is an amazing woman and a damn good mother, and she does not deserve to be spoken to that way in her own home.
Your mother was out of line.
Bea...
I think you should say something to your daughter.
(sighs) We'll leave in the morning.
* 911. What is your emergency?
BOY: Um...hi.
Hello? This is 911. Who's this?
Um, Stevie.
Okay, Stevie, my name is Maddie.
Where are you calling from?
Our house. 1963 Aldrich Drive, Glendale.
What's going on?
It's...it's my dad.
Your dad? Is he hurt?
What? No.
No, he did a bad thing.
Stevie, are you hurt?
Me? No.
It's, uh...
MAN: Stevie!
Give me that phone! (continues indistinctly) Hi. Who is this?
This is 911 emergency services.
You called 911?
(sighs) Oh, boy.
This is a little embarrassing, but my son here, he got himself into some trouble, and now he's grounded, and apparently that constitutes a life-and-death situation when you're 13 years old.
I can't tell you how sorry I am that we wasted your time.
It happens. Uh, are you sure that everyone's okay?
No, yeah, everyone's fine. Yes, thank you.
Although I know somebody whose grounding just got a little bit longer.
Sorry to have bothered you.
(line clicks) Hey.
So, I kind of got a disturbing call.
Disturbing how?
Well, it was a kid who said that his dad had done something bad, but before he could tell me what happened, the dad got on the line and said that the kid had been grounded and it was nothing.
And you think there was more to it than that?
Honestly...
I'm not sure.
Well, why don't you request a welfare check.
Have the police take a look, see if Dad's story checks out, give yourself some peace of mind.
Right.
And stop questioning your instincts.
You're coming into your own without even realizing it.
Thank you.
(doorbell rings) (indistinct radio chatter) Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Mr. Eric Parnell?
That's right.
I'm Sergeant Grant for the LAPD.
I'm here to follow up on a 911 call made from this address.
May I come in?
Sure. Of course. Please.
Can't believe they really sent someone out for this.
I explained to the 911 operator that my son...
Sir, where is your son?
I'd like to speak with him if I could.
Sure.
Just a minute.
ERIC: Sergeant?
Stevie, this is Sergeant Grant.
Do you know why she's here?
Because I called 911?
Because you called 911.
Sir, I'd like to speak with your son for a minute.
Alone.
Of course.
I'll go unload the dishwasher.
Why don't we talk outside?
Stevie...
I want you to know you're not in any trouble.
I'm just here to make sure that you're okay.
Because if you're not -- if you need help -- all you have to do is say so.
I'm here to help.
I'm okay.
I was just mad.
At your father?
You want to tell me why?
He wants to change stuff.
I liked things the way that they were.
But he, uh...
He what?
He wasn't happy with me.
He...I got scared.
I see.
It's just you and your father, is it?
Okay. Well...
you know calling 911's a serious thing, right?
Yeah.
Which is why I have to wonder if maybe the reason you called is a little more serious than just being grounded.
No, no, that's all it was. I swear.
Please, you just have to tell my dad that everything's okay.
I-I just don't want him to be mad at me anymore.
I understand, I do.
Our parents' approval is something that we all crave.
We just can't let it stop us from doing the right thing.
Understand?
I-I think so.
All right.
If you in trouble, you can always call for help, or if you need some help trying to figure out the right thing to do, you can call me directly.
I won't need to.
So...
everything good?
Or will you be taking my son into custody?
No, everything's just fine. Thank you for your cooperation.
Anytime. Stevie?
ATHENA: Bye, Stevie.
Bye.
Have a nice day, Sergeant.
You, too, sir.
So he seemed fine?
Well, I said there were no marks on him that I could see, but fine? I'm not so sure.
That's why I want to hear the call.
MADDIE (recorded): Wait, Stevie, are you hurt?
STEVIE: Me? No. It's, uh...
ERIC: Stevie, give me that phone.
Go back.
ERIC: Stevie, give me that phone.
Right there, in the background, before the dad comes to the phone.
ERIC: Stevie, give me that phone.
Stay here, don't touch anything.
So someone else was in the house?
The boy said it was just him and his dad.
You gonna behave?
NEWSWOMAN (over TV): Firefighters and paramedics responded after the patient woke from anesthesia to find the operating surgeon and nurses passed out on the floor.
The gas leak was quickly sealed off at the facility.
Most of the victims suffered only minor injuries. However, one construction worker...
ERIC: You sit here, Noah.
My name's not Noah.
It is now.
NEWSWOMAN: Both are now in stable condition.
The search continues for a lost child in Orange County tonight.
Stevie.
Stevie, turn that off.
Six-year-old Brian Gallagher was last seen outside the church his family attends in Dana Point, California.
Police are asking for your help in finding the missing boy.
If you have any information, please submit a tip to the Orange County Crime Stoppers through their website or through the number on your screen.
ROMERO: Eric Lawrence Parnell. 42.
Single. Works as a freelance I. T. guy.
Grew up at this address. Mom died in '03, left him the house. He's clean, Sergeant.
Mm, mm-hmm. Clean, or maybe just careful.
And the son?
ROMERO: Steven Parnell. 13.
Enrolled at Los Nietos Middle School. Counselor says he's a average student.
Quiet. Keeps to himself.
Except when he's calling 911.
So what do you think's going on in that house, Sergeant?
I don't know yet, but I got a gut feeling something ain't right.
Well, your gut's good enough for me, but, um, there's no reason for you to be sitting out here staring at the man's garbage.
Me and my guys can handle this.
I'm sure you'd rather be home with the family.
No, I'm good.
My mother's in town. She said she's leaving, but she can't seem to find a flight out.
Ah.
Got it.
See you back at the station, Billy.
Anything in particular you think we should be looking for?
No. Nothing in particular, just let me know what you find.
You got it.
BOBBY: I didn't know what to say.
I figured I should stay out of it, but then...Mama got mean. (chuckles) Look, there's a whole spectrum of mom A-types.
You got the cool mom, you got the helicopter mom, you got the tiger mom, and then you got Beatrice.
Yeah, terrifying mom.
She named her daughter after a Greek god.
Yeah, Athena, goddess of wisdom.
And war.
Also the goddess of crafting, but that's a whole other story.
(chuckles) The point is, Beatrice had big dreams for Athena and even bigger expectations, but she knows how this world works.
How hard Athena would have to fight for everything.
So child-rearing was less about raising a daughter and more like training a warrior.
So, no shopping trips, manicures, and long talks over cups of tea?
(laughs) Maybe in a TV commercial.
But in real life?
No one gets under their daughter's skin like a mom.
Well, what am I supposed to do, just forget it?
Just forget all the mean things she said to her?
Bobby, you said your piece.
You had Athena's back. Props to you, by the way.
But, yeah.
They'll work it out, or they won't.
Either way, you do not want to be the man standing between them.
You'll get cut down in the crossfire.
Your mother ever say those kind of terrible things to you?
Oh, no, no, no. My mother, she said a whole bunch of different other terrible things.
And you forgave her?
She's my mother.
(grunts softly) (indistinct chatter) Hey.
What are you doing here? Looking for Buck?
No, actually, I came to see you, give you this.
Oh. Okay.
Divorce papers?
This feels so sudden.
(chuckles) This is, uh, a really big step, Maddie.
I mean, he's gonna know where you are.
You sure about this?
Yeah, I know it's a risk.
But the only way I'm ever gonna feel free of him is to be free of him.
Okay. If you're sure, then, uh, I'm here for you, whatever you need.
Well, you told me once that your calendar was wide open, when I was ready.
Just, uh, name the date and time.
Friday, 7:00 p. m.
Actually, I'm kind of busy.
I'm kidding.
Yes. I can't wait.
Okay.
(laughs) Okay. I'll see you Friday night.
Friday.
(whistling, applause) Well played, well played.
(ringtone playing) Hey.
Uh, sorry, I got to cancel our thing on Friday.
You got to work?
No, actually, um, it's Maddie.
She asked me out on a date.
Wow.
I guess I was wrong about her.
Yeah.
Uh, sorry again. So, drinks are on me next time I see you.
No worries.
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other real soon.
Okay. See you.
You find anything interesting?
Only this.
ATHENA: Mm-hmm, ladies' hair dye. Black hair dye.
Probably explains the substance you found in the sink.
You spoke to the boy, his hair look dyed to you?
No. And unless it caused Parnell's to fall out, it wasn't his either. Sketchy, but not grounds for a warrant.
And probably what's not got you so excited to call me down here.
We pulled prints, we got a hit, but not Eric Parnell's. The son.
You telling me little Stevie Parnell is a felon?
No, I'm telling you Stevie Parnell is not Stevie Parnell.
His real name is Jacob Daniel Walters, and he went missing in Merced, California in 2012.
Snatched off the streets.
He was six years old.
My God.
Yup. The original investigators pulled Jacob's prints back in the day.
It's a match, no doubt about it.
What now?
Let's go. Move, move, move.
Bravo in position.
Bravo, ready.
Alpha in position.
Go, go, move.
Clear.
Clear.
All clear.
All clear.
Place is empty.
Gone?
Yeah.
(sighs) We'll put out an Amber Alert.
Your visit must've spooked him.
He didn't look spooked last night when we were sitting outside. You think he made us?
Sergeant.
Yeah?
You should see this.
Doesn't look like a 13-year-old's been sleeping here.
How old did you say Stevie was when Parnell took him?
ROMERO: Six.
Then your Amber Alert should specify adult male traveling with two minor boys, one 13...
and the other probably six.
(indistinct chatter) (camera shutter clicking) Let me take a look at that.
Thanks.
ROMERO: Yeah.
Yeah, okay. Thanks.
Just checked with the boy's school -- he never made it.
Amber Alert's gone out, and we may even have ID on the second victim.
A six-year-old boy was abducted three days ago in Dana Point. Brian Gallagher.
I think you should clear your people out of here, Detective, and get anything marked off the street.
I'm not convinced this man fled.
I mean, I think maybe he just went out.
He didn't take anything out of the closet or the prescriptions in the kitchen cabinet.
Maybe he was in a hurry.
That could be, but I think something else is going on here, just not sure what.
There's a caller by the name of Stevie Parnell on the line.
He's asking for you.
Maddie, the boy's currently the subject of an Amber Alert.
MADDIE: Stevie?
STEVIE: Is this the 911 lady I talked to before?
I...Yes, this is Maddie. Stevie, where are you right now?
Uh, I'm not sure.
I'm in a train station. I'm lost.
I need to talk to that police lady that you sent to our house.
I...I can't remember her name.
Sergeant Grant.
Yeah.
She's a friend of mine.
Yeah, I need to talk to her.
I'm getting her on the line, but I need you to try and tell me where you are.
I think we got off on the wrong train.
I-I tried to take us to Dana Point.
We? Is your father with you?
No, no, no, please. You cannot let him find us.
(phone vibrating) This is Sergeant Grant.
Athena, it's Maddie. I've got Stevie Parnell on the line.
Stevie called you?
Actually, he was trying to call you. I'll put him on now.
Stevie?
Sorry. I-I should have said something when you came to see me.
I was just so scared.
ATHENA: I know, baby.
STEVIE: But I really am trying to do the right thing.
Honey, is little Brian with you?
I'm sorry. He lied.
Who did? Who lied?
My dad. He said that Noah's parents didn't want him, and that's why he was gonna be my new brother, but...
I knew it was a lie. I-I tried to say something.
I know you did.
Where's your dad right now?
I'm not sure.
We left while he was asleep.
I was trying to take Noah home but I just got so turned around.
(phone beeping) Stevie?
(phone beeping) Oh, no. He found us.
Stevie.
Stevie!
Let's go.
Stevie!
Stevie! Stevie!
What station was he calling from?
We pinged him at North Hollywood.
I've alerted metro police and LAPD.
Units have been dispatched.
The next train at that station -- where's it coming from?
Universal City Station.
That's half a mile away.
(siren wailing) Very disappointed in you, Stevie.
What if somebody saw...what if your little brother got hurt?
He's not my little brother.
OFFICER: Dispatch, suspect has a weapon.
We've got a hostage situation unfolding here.
DISPATCHER: All units on scene, general stand-down order in effect.
Do not engage suspect.
Repeat: do not engage suspect.
(train horn blowing) And you stay back!
Stay there!
You stay there!
This right here is your stop.
(grunts) OFFICER: Grab the knife!
(shushing) (Eric groaning) Don't worry.
You're safe now. I got you.
Do not resist!
I got you both.
Parents are on their way.
He's doing pretty good, all things considered, huh?
Yeah, kids that age are pretty resilient.
He's not the one I'm worried about.
ROMERO: What about his folks? Do they know?
Local PD drove over.
The mother had a panic attack when she saw them.
She thought they were there to make a death notification.
ROMERO: So, what are you gonna tell him?
(sighs) He's not my dad, is he?
No. He's not.
Your real father and mother are on their way.
Does she have curly hair?
Your mom?
I used to have this dream when I was little.
There was a house with a big porch and...
and a lady.
She had curly hair.
I'd pull on it and she'd laugh.
But my dad -- I mean...Eric -- he...he said it wasn't real.
ATHENA: Your real name is Jacob Daniel Walters.
You were six when he took you.
You were playing outside.
Your mother heard the phone ring.
She was gone less than a minute.
But that's all it took.
Eric stole you in broad daylight.
Oh, my God. Oh!
He drove you hundreds of miles away from home so they could never find you.
(laughing) Your parents looked for you for years.
They never gave up.
STEVIE: They may remember me, but I don't remember them.
Not really.
ATHENA: They're your family.
They love you either way.
And you have the rest of your life ahead of you.
You can make new, happy memories with them.
Hi.
Hi.
(indistinct chatter) ATHENA: This is your new beginning.
(grill sizzling) Mom! We saw you on TV.
On the news.
(chuckles) You did?
Saving the day and saving those boys.
MAY: Are they gonna be okay?
They said the older boy had been with that man a long time.
I think so.
I hope so.
He's been through enough.
(chuckles) Hell of a job, Sergeant Grant.
Oh. Thank you, Captain.
Okay, looks like we're ready to eat.
Just need a minute.
Tanya Kingston.
I saw you on television with those boys and thought of her.
The men searching the woods for her, all in a line...
finding nothing but that barrette.
I never knew why you wanted this job.
Maybe I get it a little more today.
I know you think I don't understand your life.
But you never understood mine, either.
I met a man, fell in love, made a home and raised a beautiful daughter who ran away from us the first chance she got and hasn't stopped running since.
Lately, feels like you and I are rushing, racing to some finish line.
Will I die and leave you first?
Or will I live long enough to discover you've completely turned away from me?
Maybe I was running.
But not away.
This family, this job -- that's what I was running towards.
Mama, I needed to find a place with space big enough where I could build a life that was important to me.
I want you to be a part of that.
But only if you can accept all of it.
Even Bobby.
I love you, baby, but you're making a terrible mistake.
And I worry that the next time your life falls apart, you won't be able to put it back together.
(phone vibrating) Donna?
DONNA: Hey, Maddie, it's me.
Hey. Uh, how did it go?
Did you guys serve Doug with the divorce papers?
No.
Maddie, we can't find him.
(doorbell buzzes) Wait, what?
The process server made multiple attempts.
Talked to his neighbors. Nobody's seen Doug for months.
Okay, that doesn't make any sense.
Did you try his work?
DONNA: He was asked to take some personal time, after he paid your old boss a visit.
He was convinced she knew where you were.
It got physical.
Laurie? Oh, my God. How bad?
DONNA: She's okay. Security showed up and Doug ran.
(knife clicks) But nobody's seen him since.
(Chimney grunting) It's like a nightmare. Except I never wake up.
DONNA: I have investigators looking for him.
But be careful, Maddie.
Thanks.
(sighs) You are not gonna believe this.
Hey, babe.
Doug.
 @@@@@@
(heart beating) (exhales) CHIMNEY: You're gonna be just fine.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
You're gonna be fine.
CHIMNEY: April, I've got two words for you: sleeved blankets.
Why would I want that?
Okay. So you're on the sofa watching TV.
And you get a little chilly.
So your wrap yourself up in a blanket.
But now you get thirsty.
You want to grab your glass, but your arms are under the blanket.
What do you do?
Take off the blanket.
What if you didn't have to?
What if the blanket had sleeves?
Now you can grab your glass, you can use the remote, talk on the phone, all while you're still snuggled up in your warm and cozy blanket.
A backwards sweater?
Eh...
Mr. Han, last month, you came in talking about fitness centers for children.
The month before that, it was...
what was it?
Pampered pet parties.
It's like an Avon lady, but with squeaky toys and rawhide.
Please stop.
I think you need to ask yourself what it is you want to do with your life.
I'm an aspiring entrepreneur.
Soon to be a financial mogul.
Made-up terms.
Eh.
Not a calling.
Well, this doesn't really feel like banking, April.
This kind of feels like it's therapy.
It's banking.
I'll see you next month?
* Hey, I got friends *
* In low places *
* Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases *
* My blues away * Come on! Come on!
* I'll be okay * I can't hear you! Let me hear you!
* Hey, I'm not big on social graces *
* Think I'll slip on down to the oasis *
* Yeah, I've got friends *
* In low places *
(cheering) (whooping) Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I will be here all week. Literally, here all week.
So if you want to sing a song, please come find me and give me your song selection.
But please remember, management has banned the singing of "Bohemian Rhapsody."
(booing) * Lovely lady...*
(sighs) Hi. "I Love Rock N' Roll." Please?
Joan Jett. Song 341. Nice choice.
Britney Spears.
Correction. Song 891.
You're Tina, right?
I've seen you here before.
My buddy manages the place.
I just help him out from time to time.
I'm actually an entrepreneur.
What kind?
Uh...venture capital.
I provide start-ups with enough money to get off the ground in exchange for a piece of their company.
Oh, wow. So you're an angel investor?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Sounds like you know a bit about business yourself.
I do. I'm actually studying business right now.
Right on.
(chuckles) Hey. Uh, shots are up at the bar.
She's all set.
What are you, flirting with the busboy?
(scoffs) I was being nice. It must suck to be him.
* Few times I've been around that track *
* So it's not just gonna happen like that *
* 'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl *
* I ain't no hollaback girl *
CHIMNEY: She asked me if I had a calling.
You need a calling for a small business loan?
That's what I said.
Well, so maybe sleeved blankets wasn't the thing.
I'm sure the next idea will wow them.
I think I'm out of ideas.
That bank lady's right. I got to find my calling, man.
I mean, seriously, shouldn't I have, like, by now, had some kind of moment where I felt like, "Yeah, this is it"?
This is the thing I'm supposed to do.
I don't think that feeling exists.
Most people just want a job they can stomach, that pays well enough, you know?
Decent hours...
I've been hustling since I was 16.
You know how many jobs I've had.
Probably over a hundred. Nothing's stuck yet.
Well, your first job stuck.
Babysitting me when you moved in with my family.
And you're still doing it. Bossing me around, anyway.
Yeah, that's because if there's one person I know with less direction than me, Kevin, it's you.
Yeah, you really been a terrible influence.
* Few times I've been around that track * What's Marco doing?
* 'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl *
* I ain't no hollaback girl *
(screaming) (siren wailing) ("Burning Down the House" by Talking Heads playing) * Watch out *
* You might get what you're after *
* Cool, babies *
* Strange, but not a stranger *
* I'm an ordinary guy *
* Burning down the house. *
Fire captain said it was a miracle that everyone got out alive.
Said there was a ton of code violations.
Like, that dance club in El Monte a few years back?
Similar situation.
12 people died, mostly from smoke and panic.
Well, thank God that didn't happen here.
Except it did. That one woman went up like a Roman candle.
Howie tackles her to the ground like a linebacker.
I'm small, but I'm fast, evidently.
(laughter) Everyone is just freaking out.
Everyone except Howie.
He's totally cool. I mean, he actually takes charge.
I've never seen him like this before.
(screaming) Get out the door and keep moving, out this way.
KEVIN: He starts guiding people out, keeping everybody calm, and he's got 911 on the line. It was incredible.
Through the door!
Howard? You're a hero.
I don't know about that, Mrs. Lee.
I just did what I felt I needed to do.
That's the very definition of a hero.
So I can expect rent to be late this month?
(chuckles) John.
What?
I'm glad it burnt down.
And that nobody got killed.
It's time you two got out of that karaoke dump.
Now you can both go out and look for real jobs.
Well, actually, Mr. Lee, uh, I think that "real job" just found me.
I applied today to join the L. A. Fire Department to be a firefighter.
Civil service.
And I feel like this is something that I've been called on to do.
Does that sound corny?
JOHN: It's a noble pursuit.
A man's decision.
Thank you, Mr. Lee.
You should call your father.
Uh, well, you know, the time difference with Seoul is tricky, so, uh...
I should wait to see if I make it through training and if I'm actually accepted first.
Howard, um, are you sure?
It's dangerous.
JOHN: Oh, Anne, you worry too much.
(clears throat) Actually, the recruiter said that the fatality rate's less than 0.3%.
So, statistically, we'd have to be on the job for over 300 years before we're likely to die in the line of duty.
We?
Yeah. I applied, too.
Are you out of your mind?
THOMAS: You see this?
This is a Los Angeles firefighter patch.
You're all here because you want to wear one.
Membership into the world's elite lifesaving service must be earned.
Physically and mentally, you'll be tested as though your life depended on it.
Because that's the business we are in. Life and death.
Folks, this is not just another job.
This is not a hobby.
If you feel the slightest glimmer of doubt about your ability to make that kind of commitment, then I suggest you head back out that door.
* Left, left *
Okay. This morning's training evolution.
A fire's broken out on the third floor of a five-story walk-up.
Ascend to the roof and descend to the third floor.
* Left, right, left *
Three points of contact at all times!
Two hands, one foot!
One hand, two feet!
That's it, steady pace. Stay focused!
Jensen, take the door!
Come on, Lee, people are dying up there!
* Ever try to hold a lightning strike *
The perimeter is your friend.
It will support you and carry your weight.
Everything else can and will collapse under your feet.
The most important rule of rooftop is never cross-country on impulse.
Remember science class?
Heat rises.
Move, let's go!
Here we go.
Come on!
That's it.
(chain saw revving) Stay focused!
Keep the pace! Keep the pace!
* The only one left * That's it! That's it! Move!
Work as a team!
(indistinct chatter) Make the cut!
Good job, Lee.
Good job, Han. Keep it up!
Moving in!
We're only gonna do this 20 more times.
That's it.
There you go. Let's go! Let's go!
As a team!
* Left, left, right, left *
* They all fall down *
* I'll be the only one left *
* * The only one left. *
Congratulations, cadets.
You are officially probationary firefighters in the Los Angeles Fire Department.
I have your assignments.
When you hear your house number, get in line.
Ashe, Martin. 133.
Han, Howard.
118.
Jensen.
122.
Lee, Kevin.
133.
Martinez, Jorge.
127.
I love this stuff.
Mm-hmm.
I didn't think you were gonna like that.
Hey, Eli.
You forget to tip the delivery guy?
(chuckles) That's funny.
Uh, I'm Howard Han. New recruit.
You're late.
I was told 6:30, sir.
Nobody wants their firefighters showing up on time, they want them early.
Yes, of course, sir.
(alarm ringing) Uh, where do you want me, sir?
Uh, take care of the table, then clean the kitchen and then the crapper.
(siren wailing) * (dispatcher speaking indistinctly) MAN: 118 en route. Five-car pileup...
DISPATCHER: All units...
KEVIN: It was crazy. This car, it hits the streetlight so the light goes out. It's completely dark.
We pull in there, we see the wreck, get the Jaws of Life, we pry open that car like it's a tin can, we got that little girl out.
DISPATCHER: Five-alarm fire downtown.
Multiple fatalities reported.
DISPATCHER: We have a jumper downtown on the corner of Spring and 2nd.
All units, five-car pileup, multiple injuries on the 10.
Please be advised, the wires are down.
Uh, power lines are in the street.
(mouthing) Flooding on the 101 highway.
Okay.
(grunting) Damn it.
(groans) KEVIN: Got to the building.
The fire was everywhere. People were screaming.
* (continues indistinctly) The fire started coming down.
We saved everybody.
It was amazing.
Howie? How was your shift?
(alarm ringing) Attention Station 118 units, respond to a traffic accident with injuries...
All units requested.
Attempted suicide at 11117 Hartbrook Street, in North Hollywood.
(echoes) Never supposed to pull the blade out, but I guess the guy panicked when blood started spurting everywhere. It was crazy!
Yo, how about the 118, Howie?
Uh, pretty boring stuff.
Uh, jumper, uh, five-car pileup, couple of gunshot wounds, you know, the usual.
(laughs) It's crazy, right? (laughs) (alarm ringing) DISPATCHER: All units report to the Los Angeles Forum.
Yes!
Multiple stab wounds, possible fatality.
No, no, I got it. Finish your meal.
Multiple car collision on the 5.
Several fatalities have been reported.
* You still here?
See what you can do about the floor, probie.
Yes, sir.
Yes!
Yay!
Come on! Come on!
Yes!
(horn honking) MAURA: Help!
Help me, please, somebody please help me, please!
Please -- please, it's my husband.
I think he's having a heart attack. Please.
When did the pain start?
Oh, uh, just a few minutes ago. And he said his chest hurt.
And now he's having trouble breathing.
My hands.
What's wrong with your hands?
Tingling.
Tingling in your hands.
Oh, this is very important, sir.
Do you feel the tingling just in your hands?
Or do you feel like it's running down your arm?
Hands. Just hands.
Got to get the seatbelt off of you.
Okay, sir, what is your name?
Dave.
Dave.
I'm gonna need you to breathe for me, all right?
I want you to slowly pull air in through your mouth for a count of four, hold it for one second, then out for a count of four.
You got me? Okay, breathe in, two, three, four, hold.
(wheezing) And out, two, three, four, hold.
You're doing great. Keep doing that, okay?
So, ma'am, um, what were you guys doing before the pain started?
Um, uh, we went to brunch and then we had a walk on the beach.
And he said he wasn't feeling well so I just drove us here.
Okay. Uh, Dave, you're doing really great.
Um, tell me about brunch.
Buffet.
Buffet. Right on.
Okay, and, uh, did you just have one thing?
Or did you have, like, a little bit of everything?
Bits of everything.
Bits of everything. Yeah, that's how you do it at a buffet.
Right? Little of this, little of that.
Before you know it, you've tried everything.
Um, don't you think you should use the paddle thingies and shock his heart or something?
No, I-I think he's doing better now.
Dave, do you feel like you're doing better?
Yeah.
I do.
I feel better.
Oh, the pain. (belches) Ooh.
See? It's just probably indigestion.
So you started to feel the pain in your chest, and then you started to panic, right?
Panic attack can look a lot like a heart attack to a layperson. I think you're gonna be fine.
Oh, God.
MAURA: You are my angel. Come here.
(laughs): Come here.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What about that burger place?
Tommy, I hate that place.
Hey, guys, weirdest thing happened today...
GERRARD: Hey, wasn't your girlfriend supposed to come and cook us dinner?
TOMMY: Uh, next Tuesday.
GERRARD: Promise?
TOMMY: Uh -- uh, yes. Yeah, I will promise...
(Skype ringing) Hello.
Howard?
Yep. It's your other kid.
Dad, I don't need money. I've got some news.
I got a new job. I joined the fire department.
It's not just fires, it's fire and rescue.
I save lives.
Right. Of course. You know what?
Sorry to bother you.
No, I'm okay, Pop. I was just calling to check in.
It's nothing...
(Skype beeps) Nothing important.
I thought it would be a good time to call Seoul.
It wasn't.
Your father...
I know.
He's a very, very busy man.
He's a jackass.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be calling him names.
No, no, no, no, no. I like where this is going. Please, continue.
Your mother, your mother was so vibrant.
So full of joy.
I just, I never understood how she ended up married to such a colorless man.
(chuckles) I miss her.
So do I.
She was my best friend.
If you and Mr. Lee hadn't taken pity on me after she died...
It wasn't pity.
We took you in because we love you, Howie.
You're family.
Then that's all I need.
(laughs, sniffles) * Hey, man, let's build a bridge here, huh?
Come on.
What about movies? I've seen them all.
Sports? I can tell the difference between a home run and a touchdown. Kind of.
TV, Broadway, classic literature, tell me what your thing is, and I'll make it mine.
Let's just be cool here, man.
You know, I'm told I have formidable people skills, but you just really don't like me much, do you?
If I thought about you at all, honestly, I probably wouldn't.
Suit up, Han. You're with me today.
I cleared it with the captain.
Yeah, but I'm not a paramedic.
I mean, you're not much of a firefighter, either.
But you can stay here and play butler or, you know...
No, no, no! Put me in the game, coach. I'm ready to play.
Fair warning, this is a "careful what you wish for" situation.
* (siren wailing, horns honking) Oh!
Where's it all coming from?
Worry about where it's going. Here.
(retches) * Well, I'm running...*
Put pressure here, grab the tourniquet.
* Well, I'm running *
* Police on my back *
Turn his head, prevent him from aspirating.
Got to keep his airway clear.
* And the victim *
* Well, he won't come back...*
Oh -- oh! Oh, my God.
Come on. Latch it.
* Wednesday, Thursday, Friday *
* Saturday, Sunday...*
Focus, yank it.
Stem the blood loss.
This job is science meets rock and roll.
If we don't improv, people die.
* What have I done? *
* What have I done? * Oh...
I'm dying.
You're not dying, sir, you're gonna be just fine.
* Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday...*
ELI: You having fun?
I can see why they don't put this in the brochure.
* What have I done? * You're gonna be just fine, sir.
Ah, ah.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.
(sirens wailing) (dispatcher speaking indistinctly) Thanks.
It's not personal, you know.
Look, in this job, friends die and funerals are held.
They're not gonna just give you their friendship until you earn their respect.
They're not just protecting you, they're protecting themselves.
You don't name a puppy until you know it's gonna pull through.
Oh, so in this scenario, I'm a puppy?
There you go.
(laughs) You know, when I saw these guys, I just thought they're heroes; maybe I could be one, too.
When I saved that girl at the bar, for a second there I felt, maybe for the first time ever, not heroic, just...useful.
I never saw myself old, with a family, so I figured, what the hell, live fast, die young.
Pull some folks through a burning building in slo-mo.
(laughs) Yeah, but that's only half the job.
I mean, when you come out of that building, you got to give 'em to me.
And if I let 'em die, then all that...
all that effort, all that risk, it was for nothing.
But that's why you became a paramedic?
It wasn't 'cause I liked the schooling.
(laughs) A few years ago, I pulled a ten-year-old third-degree out of a car fire.
Right? And I handed her off to some rookie M. D., who everyone said was a golden boy, and I watched him do everything wrong.
She died on that scene before we left.
Yeah, but for you, it's-it's not about the rush anymore?
You know, the thrill?
If that's the question you're gonna ask after that, I am sorry in advance for the lesson you're gonna learn.
(alarm ringing) DISPATCHER: Attention Station 118 units, respond to a structure fire...
We got a barn burner. Mount up.
You, too, probie.
Get in.
(sirens wailing) (heart pounding) (horn honking) MADDIE: Chim?
Metro, this is 118, on scene and in command.
MAN (over radio): Thank God you made it.
The fire is spreading quickly.
Sir, sir, it's like an inferno in there!
We need to get this ventilated. Let's move!
Finally.
Keep moving. We need to vent this fire out.
Look for weak spots so that we can cut through.
(indistinct chatter) (chain saw revving) All right, let's do it here!
Give me a hole right here!
Yeah, right there!
* Radio down, let's go.
All right.
THOMAS: The perimeter is your friend.
It will support you and carry your weight.
Everything else can and will collapse under your feet.
(coughing) (crying) CHIMNEY: Don't move! Stay right there!
Ma'am, stay right there, do not move!
Stay there!
CHIMNEY: No, don't move!
Don't move!
Don't move!
CHIMNEY: Stay right there!
(creaking) We'll come to you!
Right there, don't move!
Don't move -- stay!
Do not move!
Kevin, no!
(shouts) Are you okay?
(coughing) CHIMNEY: Mayday.
We got a firefighter who's gone through the roof.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
(continues indistinctly) Now!
I'm so sorry.
(crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
(wailing) FIRE CHIEF (echoing): Throughout most of history, the lives of firefighters have been closely associated with the ringing of a bell.
As they began their hours of duty, it was the bell that started it off.
Through the day and night, each alarm was sounded by a bell that called them to fight fire and to place their lives in jeopardy for the good of their fellow man.
And when the fire was out, and the alarm had come to an end, the bell rang ten times to signal that end.
(bell rings) And now, our brother Kevin Lee has completed his task...
(guns firing) * (heart beating) THOMAS: Never cross-country on impulse.
ELI: Hey. It's good to see you.
Wasn't sure you'd be back.
Didn't have anywhere else to go.
(sirens wailing, horns honking) Officer, what do you got?
Shopping center expanding its underground parking garage, but somebody screwed up.
The entire floor collapsed in the biggest store.
Now, they're telling me it shifted down about three feet, but the floor is still there, just be careful where you step.
All right, people. Standard search and rescue. Let's move!
Cap, I'm gonna help Eli out.
Go.
Hi, I'm Howie. I'm gonna be checking you out.
How's your breathing?
Can you follow my finger?
This one's stable.
Squeeze my hand.
Headache? Let me check this out.
Okay.
Can you follow my finger?
And you don't normally get migraines?
Not even headaches.
And it started after the first floor collapsed?
Before, actually.
I think it's all the folding I do.
I work in the fitting room and no one -- and I mean no one -- ever folds their clothes.
MAN: Oh, my head.
You have a headache, huh?
Feels like a migraine?
Uh-huh.
ATHENA: All right, this looks to be the last of them.
Your captain's calling it.
I'm-a start sending over members of the construction crew.
Foreman's telling me a few of his guys have been hurling for the last hour.
Okay, thank you, Officer. Hey, Eli, you hearing this?
I'm getting vomiting and headaches.
Maybe they broke a gas main down there?
We'd be smelling it. The lines are intact.
Kinard. It's all clear.
Tommy, come in.
O'Conner. Where's Tommy?
He was right behind me.
* (heart beating) Officer, clear everyone back from this building!
I think it's a methane leak!
What does that probie think he's doing?
Move away from the building! Everyone, let's go!
Everybody move away!
Let's go!
(people screaming) Back! Back!
(grunting) * Wake * * From your sleep * * The drying of * * Your tears *
* Today * * We escape * * We escape...* * Breathe * * Keep breathing * * Don't lose...*
You still here?
* Your nerve * * You can * * Laugh * (screams) * A spineless *
MADDIE: Chimney?
* Laugh * * We hope your...*
CHIMNEY: I applied today to join the L. A. Fire Department to be a firefighter.
KEVIN: I applied, too.
* Wisdom * * Choke you now. *
ELI: Hey.
Hey.
Part of the job is learning to love terrible coffee.
Tommy?
Resting.
Well, I got to say, for a guy who huffed gas and got dragged out of a burning building, he looks better than you do.
(chuckles) Yeah, well, the Ramada, this is not.
Shift starts in about an hour, I'll clean up at the station.
Hand it off, man.
Sorry?
You're gonna get hurt in this business.
You, me, them.
Hell, we all signed up for it, right?
We raised our hands and said, "Yes, please," to the burns and the broken bones, the cartoon bruises, two weeks without eyebrows.
Right?
But you know that's not the hurt I'm talking about.
You're right, this coffee sucks. (chuckles) The things that can't be treated with ointment and a splint are the things that'll kill us.
The guilt, the loss, the images...
We can't drink or sniff or screw them away.
Hand it off.
Kevin died, Eli.
And Tommy didn't because of you.
I know it's easy when the girl's on fire or the guy's bleeding out to think that we're God, but we ain't.
You got to let that ego burn away, man.
You are not that powerful.
Hand it off.
We treat the wounded, we hand them off.
These doctors, they do their job, they hand them off, to God or the universe, karma, wh-whatever the hell you want to call it. Hey.
But we hand them off so that we can pick up the next guy.
And at the end of the day, maybe ourselves.
Because if we don't...we become the patients.
And the world has too many of them.
What it needs is more caregivers.
So...come on.
(groans) Go give care.
Right.
But first, better coffee.
(chuckles) And a decent breakfast, on you for the sage advice.
(chuckles) Right.
All right. You have your wallet, right?
Oh, you know, I think...
Ah, you have your wallet.
Sorry, buddy. (laughs) You got your wallet.
* Mrs. Lee, hi.
Hello, Howard.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
I'm so sorry. Here, please, come in.
I apologize. I'm-I'm just getting settled in right now.
I know it's a mess.
Uh, here, for your new home.
We wish you prosperity.
Thank you.
So, uh...
how's Mr. Lee doing?
(sighs) He couldn't come, not yet.
Please forgive him.
Forgive me.
But it's not your fault.
I'm the one who got Kevin into this. I'm the reason that...
I knew my boy.
When he was sad, when he was happy.
I had never seen him happier.
Being a firefighter, finally having something important to do.
All you did was help him find his purpose.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without him. (chuckles) He'll be watching over you, along with your mother.
Both of them so proud.
All of us, mm?
* Thank you.
Love Actually, monster trucks, craft beer.
(chuckles) So you're back?
How's that head of yours?
Still fat, but clearer.
You saved my life.
Thank you.
Thanks, Tommy.
ELI: Come on.
Somebody out here wants to talk to you.
Hi. Hello.
We just wanted to come here and thank you.
You're the reason that we're both alive.
Uh, so who do we have here?
This is Adam. Say hi.
Hi, Adam.
He still needs a middle name.
Oh.
Uh...
My name's Howie.
Oh...
Well, it's Howard.
You know what? I think I'm gonna have to earn some kind of cool nickname. "Howie's" just not gonna cut it, is it? (chuckles) (Adam fusses) You know, I think he looks like a Kevin.
(Adam coos) TOMMY: Paramedic, huh?
Damn good one.
(sirens wailing) * The bittersweet between my teeth...*
ELI: We have a GSW five minutes out. Patient is stable.
Getting the bleeding under control now, just give me a second.
You need me to get in there?
No, I got it.
I'm dying!
Sir, you're gonna be just fine.
Bullet went straight through. It's your upper shoulder, and it's no veins or arteries. You're just in shock.
Just turn your head. One second. Okay...
(retches) Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
You're gonna be fine.
* Fall back in love eventually...*
You're gonna be fine.
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. * (insects chirping)
 @@@@@@
I have an adult male with multiple stab wounds to his torso.
Need medical and police response.
JOSH: Okay, sir, can I get your name?
Evan Buckley.
I'm a firefighter with the 118.
Buck?
Yeah, uh, victim is Howard Han.
He's got profuse bleeding to his abdomen.
Breathing is labored. Might have hit a lung.
Come on, Chim. Hang in there.
JOSH: Buck, RA unit's two minutes out.
Do you know how this happened?
How long has he been down?
I don't know.
I just got home and found him.
Given the amount of blood, I would say minutes, not hours.
JOSH: How's his pulse?
Weak, but it's there.
Jason...
H-Hold on, he's, uh...
he's talking. Chim, it's me, it's Buck. I'm here, okay?
I just need you to stay with me, Chimney.
Jason took her...
Chimney, who is Jason?
Maddie...
(sirens approaching) Where is Maddie?
Chimney, where is Maddie?
Chimney, where is Maddie?
Wh-Where is Maddie?
(siren wailing) We got it, sir.
Maddie!
Maddie!
Maddie.
Maddie, where are you?
Maddie! Maddie, are in you here?
Maddie!
(panting) She's, uh...she's not here.
She's gone.
Oh, no.
JOSH: Buck? What is it, Buck?
Did you find something?
All of her stuff is still here.
All units responding to 1832 Bryson, be advised we also have a critical missing adult female: Maddie Buckley Kendall.
He found her.
(rummaging, drawers opening and closing) Hey, babe, where's the thing?
MADDIE: What thing?
That fancy opener that I took out a loan for.
Screw it. I'm going old-school.
("Nothing Can Change This Love" by Sam Cooke playing) Made a mix, some of your favorites.
Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye.
Nice. Greatest love songs ever written.
(chuckles) And every one of them reminds me of you.
You're sweet.
I am, it would appear, the heart surgeon that stole your heart.
Not just surgeon; the chief of cardiothoracic medicine.
I'm really proud of you.
Second-youngest in the state, which my father would file under the "Close But Not Quite" Department.
But screw him, right?
We're celebrating anyway.
No, no, put away those Two-Buck Chuck glasses.
An occasion like this requires something more distinctive.
Wow, we haven't, uh, used those since the wedding.
Yeah.
One of the few things I have left of my mother.
* You're the apple of my eye *
* You're cherry pie...* Toast softer this time.
The chip is still there.
This promotion, it's not because of some good-luck glasses.
* Sugar and spice * It's because of my good-luck girl.
* And everything nice...* To my Maddie.
* My, my, my, my dreams *
* But if you wanted *
* To leave me and roam *
* When you got back * (laughter) * I'd just say, "Welcome home" *
* 'Cause, honey, nothing...* (laughter, muttering) * Nothing...* (music stops abruptly) (gasps) Accidents happen, right?
My mother always used to say that an accident is just an opportunity to learn.
The problem, Maddie, is that you never do.
(passing car honks horn) Damn it, Maddie!
This is your fault.
I told you, I told you you couldn't leave me.
I warned you.
(crying): Is he dead?
If he's not, he will be.
He's not our problem anymore.
Why would you do that?
He's-he's such a-a kind man. He was so good.
You think I don't know that?
I didn't want to hurt him. I liked Chimney.
We were friends.
What?
But you cloud me, Maddie.
You fog up my head. You always have.
If you'd have just stayed.
Doug, how long have you been here?
I needed to make sure you were safe.
I saw you with Buck, I thought, all right, fine.
She needs some time, just give her some space.
She'll come home.
She always comes home.
And then Chimney told me you asked him out, and I knew...I knew I waited too long.
No.
No, can you just pull over? We can talk.
It's not too late.
Of course it's too late.
I just killed a man for you, Maddie.
There is no coming back from that.
Not for me, and not for you.
(indistinct chatter) I got here as fast as I could.
How's he doing?
Alive, but he's got a punctured lung and a lacerated stomach.
Is he in surgery?
Not yet. He lost a lot of blood.
But as soon as he's stable, they'll prep him for surgery.
Who would do something like this?
BUCK: It was Doug.
Doug Kendall.
He told Maddie he would kill her if she left him.
He did this.
You said he lives in Pennsylvania.
He knows she was here?
No, she-she...
ATHENA: She was filing for divorce.
That could have put her back on his radar.
MARKS: Well, we'll take a look at him, but before your friend lost consciousness, he said he was attacked by a Jason Bailey.
Either of you know who that is?
I don't think so.
Wait, uh...
Wait. Hold on, Detective. I know he had a new friend, some guy he was...he was playing pool with.
I never met him, but now I know why, you know, 'cause it was Doug. He got close to Chimney so that he could get close to Maddie.
You don't believe me? I mean, I mean, Chimney's phone is right there. You know, ch-check for yourself.
Phone's locked.
Can't open it without the victim's consent.
ATHENA: They'll subpoena his phone records, but it'll take time.
Well, Maddie doesn't have time, okay?
Come on, Doug did this!
He-he almost killed Chimney, and...
and he could...he could kill her next.
But he didn't.
Bobby...
Buck, just listen to me.
Buck, may-maybe you're right.
It's Doug.
And he found out where Maddie was, and he came here, and he hurt Chimney, but Maddie's not here, and if all he wanted to do was kill her...
Then I would have found her, too.
And you didn't. She was alive when he took her, and that's what we're gonna hold onto right now.
Um, uh...
Can I...can I...can I...can I change my shirt?
Uh, it-it's covered in...
Fine, just don't touch anything.
And bag his shirt when he's done.
Athena, someone has to prepare him.
We're not there yet.
You don't think you're gonna find her alive.
The most dangerous time for a woman in these situations.
When she leaves. Maddie knew that.
That's why she was in hiding.
But if it is him...
Those scenarios usually don't come with a happy ending.
BUCK: Hey, Cap, I need to go to the hospital.
I-I-I want to see Chimney.
I'll drive him.
Anyone see anything?
No witnesses.
We're still trying to access her security footage, but a camera across the street caught a man forcing her into his car.
All we got is a four-door sedan, dark in color.
Doesn't exactly narrow the search.
Mm.
Where's Chimney's phone?
(monitor beeping) (sighs) Sorry about this, buddy.
You're not supposed to be in here.
Oh, oh, God, please don't let him die.
Please, sir.
You have to go back to the lobby.
You can't, you can't die on me.
Sir, you need to leave. No.
You can't, please...
Sir, you have to go.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going.
ATHENA: You know, Detective Marks didn't believe me.
He said no one could be that stupid.
I said, "You don't know Buck." So...
that was a bold move.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
"What were you thinking, Buck?" I already got an earful from Athena.
Oh, no, I know what you were thinking. I got sisters, too.
(chuckles) Still not sure how you thought you were getting away with it, though.
I wasn't worried about that.
Mm.
It's, like, police have all these rules, you know?
Rules that are gonna get Maddie killed.
But-but I'm a civilian.
Those rules, they don't apply to me, right?
Then why are you in hospital jail?
(Eddie sighs) I told Maddie...
I said that she didn't need to keep on running, that she could start over here, that she would be safe.
That I would keep her safe.
(sighs) This isn't your fault.
What if she had kept running?
You think he wouldn't have found her?
Only then, she'd be alone.
She's alone now, with him.
ATHENA: I spoke with Detective Marks.
He's not happy with you.
I-I-I just...
Yeah, you broke chain of custody.
You unlocked Chimney's phone without his permission.
Marks can't use any of it.
I'm sorry.
Okay? I was trying to help.
Okay. Let's go.
The car's out front.
You're arresting me.
Not yet. But the night's still young.
Uh, wh-where are we going?
To find your sister.
If Doug is Jason, this phone is how we find him.
But we gonna need a little help.
I thought you said we couldn't use the phone.
I said Marks can't use it.
This isn't my case.
I'm just a concerned friend of the victim.
Thank you.
Buck.
Here are the ground rules: You don't leave her sight, you don't lie, you don't withhold any information from her, you don't break the law, and you don't do anything that's gonna force her into early retirement. You got it?
You got it, Cap.
(electronic chiming) DOUG: Come on. Where is it?
AUTOMATED VOICE: Continue following the road for 1.7 miles.
I don't...I don't see anything.
Just do it already.
What?
Kill me.
That's your plan, right?
Kill Chimney, kill me; hopefully, do the world a favor and kill yourself before it's done.
Why would I kill you, Maddie?
I don't want to hurt you. I love you.
I can't imagine my life without you.
You're all I have.
You don't have me.
Your destination is on the right.
DOUG: There it is.
You see?
Never give up hope.
(bell chimes) Don't move.
(phone chimes) (banging) SUE: I'm not sure how we can help, Sergeant, but whatever you need.
Athena, please. I'm off duty.
This is Josh.
Athena.
And Buck, Maddie's brother.
Maddie's told me a lot about you.
Same here. Any word on her?
ATHENA: Well, police don't have much to go on yet. So, neither one of us are good at sitting around and waiting, so I thought I'd come by and ask you some questions, unofficially.
Sure.
What do you want to know?
Well, when people dial 911, you can see where they're calling from, right?
If they're calling from a landline, absolutely.
Cell phones are trickier.
We don't get an automatic address.
Our system has to digitally request the phone's location from the cellular network.
Okay, well, this is Chimney's phone.
We think he was in contact with his attacker.
Maddie's husband.
BUCK: Uh, Chimney didn't know it was him; he-he thought his name was Jason.
ATHENA: Now, I'm wondering, hypothetically, if this number called 911 and hung up, is your system able to request location data after the call was disconnected?
Hypothetically, sure.
But we'd...
Of course we could.
You know, it's funny, this number seems familiar, and, in fact, I think I might have taken a call from it earlier.
An emergency call.
SUE: Josh, are you sure?
I'm sure.
Okay. Let's make a manual request.
(keyboard clicking) * DOUG: Hey, where you going?
Oh, I-I was looking for you.
I have to pee.
Yeah? You sure that's all?
Y-Yeah. I mean, look around, Doug.
Where am I going to run to?
Do you want me to pee in the restroom or the car?
(knife clicks) Keep your head down.
CASHIER: Evening.
You folks doing okay?
Yeah, good. Um, do you have a restroom that I could use?
Uh, I feel like we've been on the road forever.
Sure thing.
In the back, to the left.
* Will make foolish people do * Thank you.
* I never dreamed that I'd meet *
* Somebody like you...* (door opens, closes) (lock clicks) You folks vacationing?
Yeah. Second honeymoon.
(panting) You okay, babe?
MADDIE: Yeah. Yeah, I-I'll be out in a minute.
(pounding on door) Let's go.
(pounding on door) Let's go, Maddie.
(grunts) Maddie!
(gasps) No!
You're always running.
Aren't you tired by now? I sure am tired of chasing you.
Just let me go.
Please just let me go. Let me go!
(gun clicks) CASHIER: Hey!
No...
You heard the lady.
Back away. Let her go.
Oh, no. Sir, honestly, I-I think that you've...
I said back away.
I-I think you're misunderstanding.
Back away, man.
(grunting and groaning) (gunshot) (cashier groans) (Maddie screams) DOUG: Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
(panting) MADDIE: Sir...
Sir, stay with me, okay? I'm gonna call 911, and they are gonna save you.
Stay with me. Okay, it's okay.
Stay with me.
(gunshot) (gasps, shudders) (crying): Oh, my God.
No one's saving anyone now.
Let's go. Let's go.
(crying): No, no...
So, Chimney goes online to one of those Internet forums for new mothers.
They all give him advice.
"Skin-to-skin contact works best." "No, the sound of a-a vacuum cleaner." "A cool breeze is soothing." A vacuum to stop a baby crying? I missed out on all this.
Which one did he go with?
All of them.
(laughter) We come home and find him asleep -- shirtless -- on the floor with Denny on top of him, a fan blowing at them and the vacuum cleaner running in the corner.
(laughter) Wow, uh, he went all out, huh?
He always does.
He always puts his heart into everything.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
Oh, Harry and I were out.
I needed to get some coffee.
Then we thought, you guys probably need some, too.
Ah, we haven't met, but I love you. Eddie.
Michael. Pleasure.
Hey, this is a surprise.
HARRY: We brought food.
Got you a bear claw.
That's my favorite.
Thank you.
You check on Chim?
Yeah, he's still in surgery.
It's starting to feel like an annual tradition.
Another hospital, another girlfriend not by his bedside and me wondering what I'm supposed to tell him when he wakes up.
We'll tell him the truth.
Whatever that turns out to be.
All right.
Thank you.
Very thoughtful.
Oh, it's Harry's idea.
You know, he was worried, so he wanted to come down and make sure everything was okay.
Eh, he's a sweet kid. It's nice of him to be worried about Chimney.
Uh, he wasn't worried about Chimney.
He was worried about you.
(line ringing) MARKS: Detective Marks.
Andy, it's Athena.
Listen, you're gonna get a call from Sue Blevins at 911 dispatch.
She might have a lead on Doug's location.
MARKS: Do I want to know how she obtained this very important information?
Let's just call it an anonymous tip and not look any gift horses in the mouth.
We'll meet you there.
Copy that. (sighs) (phone beeps) You're awfully quiet over there, Buckaroo.
Uh, when we get there...what-what do you think we're going to find?
I mean, he-he threatened to kill her, you know, a-almost did kill Chimney.
What if...what if he...
No.
My gut is telling me not to count your sister out just yet.
Maddie didn't just rebuild her life.
She rebuilt herself.
Doug may have her, but I don't think he has any idea who he's dealing with now.
(siren wailing) DOUG: Damn it.
We have to get off this road.
Just shut up.
There were cameras, Doug. When they find that guy...
Do you think this was my fault?
No.
No, it was my fault.
That's right.
That's what happens when you try to run away from me, Maddie.
People get hurt.
Yeah, I know.
I'm done running.
You must think I'm an idiot.
I think you're a monster. I don't think you're...
That was honest, anyway.
I mean it.
I can't stand the idea of one more person dying, so I'm not gonna run, Doug.
You've got me.
But we have to get off this road.
We need to figure this out.
Is that what you're gonna do, Maddie?
You're gonna help me figure this out?
That's what I do.
I help people think clearly in a crisis.
I am thinking clearly.
Yeah? So where are we going?
I'll figure it out.
The longer we are on this road, the more likely it is that we get pulled over, and we both know how that ends.
So what do you suggest?
I saw signs for...for Big Bear a few miles back.
There are vacation homes.
Probably empty.
Like the Poconos.
Yeah. You'll love it.
(sniffles) (monitor beeping) Hi, Chimney.
Hey.
I heard you had another surgery.
Yeah.
I guess I'm catching up with you.
Hey.
You're awake.
Looks like you got your first visitor.
Does your dad know you're in here?
(whispers): Chris.
I'm gonna say no.
Welcome back, man.
We were worried about you.
I wasn't worried.
I'm starting to think he's invincible.
Like a superhero?
Yeah.
Just like a superhero.
EDDIE: Okay, buddy.
Let's, uh, let Chimney rest.
We can visit him later.
Don't eat the meat loaf.
No?
That's how I lost a tooth.
Thanks for the tip, buddy.
EDDIE: Let's go.
Have a good rest.
Where's Maddie?
TRUCK DRIVER: It's not my phone.
I don't know where it came from.
Found the phone.
No sign of our suspect or your sister.
Yeah, but he has Doug's phone. How?
Well, driver left Salt Lake City yesterday.
Been on the road ever since. Says he's got no clue how the phone ended up in his truck.
Sir, you make any stops?
Gas station, just before sunrise.
See anybody else there?
When I was leaving, saw a couple going into the store.
He knew we could use the phone to track him.
Probably dropped it in the truck just to throw us off.
So they could be anywhere by now.
Yeah. And Doug's way ahead of us.
I don't think I brought enough.
No, you brought everything I needed.
Missed the whole day with him.
I know.
That's why we came.
Well, that and I remember what it was like to live at a hospital.
Uncomfortable chairs, terrible food.
You don't have to stay.
I-I mean, if you have stuff to do...
No.
I'm good here.
(indistinct chatter over radio) MARKS: We only have eyes on the pumps and the register.
Now, best we can guess, she goes out the back window, husband catches her.
Yeah, cashier sees something's wrong. Goes to help.
Winds up getting shot with his own gun.
Guess he thought he could handle it on his own.
Sir.
Found this in the bathroom.
It's a rental car agreement.
For a dark gray, four-door sedan.
Looks like she started to write "help" on the back.
Rented near Burbank Airport.
I'll put out an APB.
Well, we know where he rented the car.
Maybe we can use that to track him.
Uh, like LoJack.
Well, rental car companies don't use GPS tracking.
It's too expensive.
Yeah.
Major companies don't. But if you're Bob and you only have 12 cars in your fleet, you might want to know where they are at all times.
Hey. It's Marks.
I think we got a lead on our suspect.
(bird calling) Thank God there wasn't an alarm.
Why do you think I cut the phone line?
So I couldn't call for help.
Yeah, that, too.
All right, I guess I'll make us a fire.
Give us some warmth.
I'll see if I can get some food.
Whoa. In the kitchen? Where the knives live?
I don't think so.
Just sit right there.
(Doug sniffing, panting) You remember you and me and that place in the Poconos?
Was it our second anniversary?
Fourth.
Don't forget to open the flue this time.
The cleaning fee was almost as much as the cabin rental.
Smelled like smoke for a week.
Yeah.
Bunch of hick firefighters laughing at the city kid.
I'm trying to impress my wife, and they're down there flirting with her.
What is it with women?
They get all weak-kneed over a man in uniform.
I don't know.
I married a guy who wears surgical scrubs.
(chuckles) Yeah, I guess I'm a man in uniform, too, huh?
(sighs) (knock on door) Good evening, ma'am.
Hello, Officer. How can I help you?
Uh, one of your neighbors called us.
Said they heard some yelling, some sounds of a fight.
Thought there might been some kind of altercation going on.
It must have been a mistake, 'cause everything's fine here.
It's a warm night for a sweater.
Yeah, I-I don't know who would have called you, but...
everything's fine.
Ma'am, if you're in some kind of danger...
DOUG: Hey, babe, everything okay?
Officer. What's going on?
Uh, we just had some reports about, um...
some cars being broken into in the neighborhood.
I just wanted to check and see if you folks might have seen or heard anything.
Oh, man, that's terrible.
MADDIE: Yeah, I was just saying that we, um, we didn't hear anything.
DOUG: Yeah.
Well, thank you for your time.
Of course. You have a good one, Officer.
Oh, uh, I just need you to sign this right here to prove I did a thorough canvass.
Look, I get you're scared of what he'll do if you report him, but you need to think about what he's gonna do if you don't.
Okay? Don't be afraid to run.
Be afraid to stay.
DOUG: We can be happy again.
A fresh start in a new place.
New names. We can become new people.
All right, not just to the world, but to each other.
And you'll forgive me and love me again. I know it.
Yeah.
I always found a way to forgive you.
So we try again.
Start right now.
(Doug groans) (Maddie gasping) Oh, my God.
(whimpering) Maddie!
(gunshot) (screams) Maddie!
I'm such an idiot.
I'm the one who put her in danger.
Stop it.
He was playing me this whole time.
(deep inhale) How could I not see it?
Because psychopaths don't generally announce that they're psychopaths.
He's gonna kill her, isn't he?
I don't know.
(panting) (grunts) (birds cawing) (grunts, panting) (panting) Maddie! Maddie!
You can't keep running!
You can't run forever!
(panting) Maddie!
(echoing): You can't run forever.
(panting) (panting) Maddie!
(siren wailing) OFFICER (over radio): We found the rental car.
No sign of the suspect or the victim.
MARKS: We found the kidnapper's abandoned vehicle nearby, so we're looking for a couple.
They, uh, may have come in earlier looking for a last-minute rental.
No, it's been quiet today. Nobody's come in.
Are these all the properties that you manage?
Uh, no, those are just the ones we highlight.
There's a...a magazine inside.
It has all the listings.
Um, how many do you manage?
300.
(panting) You backtracking bitch.
(Maddie yells) (Doug grunts) (yelps, screams) (gun clicking) (sighs) I'm not running. (grunts) (panting) (shouts, groaning) (screams) No!
(screams) (panting) (grunting) (panting) (grunting) (shouts) (Maddie screams) (grunting) (shouts, groaning) (panting, grunting) (sobbing) (Doug coughs) (gurgles) (coughing) (birds cawing) * (indistinct police radio transmission) Thank you...Officer.
Thank you.
DOUG: You don't have to lie to me.
I know what he said.
What they all say.
They want you to leave me.
But they don't understand that that can never happen.
We're meant to be together.
To live together, to grow old together and die together.
That's...
that's how this story ends.
(inhales) (crying) (panting) No.
No.
(panting, groaning) *
* MARKS: Local sheriff got a report of gunshots.
They followed up. Found this.
Yeah, rental manager says all the lake cabins are vacant.
Well, somebody's been here, and they left in a hurry.
(exhales) It's got to be them, right?
Question now is, which way did they go?
(sighs) If she's out there and...
and she's hurt...
They're sending more officers.
Search and rescue's on its way.
Choppers, dogs.
It's gonna be a full-court press.
SHERIFF: I got blood out here!
Maddie! Maddie!
(panting) (gasping) (panting) * Maddie!
Buck?
Maddie!
Buck?
(pants) Maddie.
(sobs): Buck!
(panting) (sobbing) Hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (panting) I'm here. I'm here.
(sobs) I didn't give up.
(crying) I...I didn't give up.
(sobs): I...
(panting) (Athena speaking indistinctly) You did so good.
(helicopter blades whirring) Never seen red snow before. (exhales) It's a miracle she made it out alive.
No. No miracle here.
That woman fought like hell.
(siren wailing) BUCK: Almost there. You're doing great.
(weakly): Tired.
Uh, hey, hey, Maddie, I-I know...
I know you're tired, but I-I need you to keep your eyes open for me.
Yeah, you-you know the drill.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, just, uh...just like that.
(sniffles) Hey, you, uh...you think you had a hard day.
Athena and I have been running all over the state looking for you.
I wasn't dressed for snow.
Me, either.
(chuckles) (sniffles) Athena said she'd, uh...
she'd call Bobby, let everyone know that you're okay.
They are gonna be...so relieved.
Chimney.
Chimney most of all.
Chimney's alive?
Oh, my God. Y...
Maddie, no, yeah, Ch-Chimney's alive.
He, uh...(chuckles) He-he made it through.
(shudders) You both did.
(sniffles) (shudders) * When the rain is blowing *
* In your face *
* And the whole world *
* Is on your case *
* I could offer you...* How are we doing, Mr. Han?
Ready to get out of here.
Three days after major abdominal surgery?
You might want to pace yourself.
I'm gonna start pacing myself up and down these walls pretty soon.
Well, maybe...your friend can distract you.
* And there is no one there to dry your tears...* (chuckles) What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in the hospital?
I am in the hospital.
I got myself transferred.
(exhales) No, no, no...
No.
All this is...gonna heal.
I'm gonna be okay.
* But I would never do you wrong...* How are you feeling?
Starting to hate hospitals.
(both chuckle) But this is much better than rebar.
No coma, so...
(Chimney inhales sharply) I thought...(exhales) I really thought that...
Me, too.
(chuckles) You're okay.
(sniffles) * I'd go crawling down the avenue * We're okay. (sniffles) * No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do *
* To make you feel *
* My love. *
 @@@@@@
(birds chirping) (dog barking in distance) DAVID (chuckles): Look at that.
It's better than the pictures, Dad.
Could I take a look at my room?
(sighs) Have at it.
Yes. Yes!
Come on, Jamie.
Go on. I'll be right behind you.
JAMIE: Alex, wait up!
(Alex laughing) (laughs softly) We made it, babe.
JAMIE: Need some help?
Hey.
Just, uh, yeah, moving is overwhelming, you know?
I miss her, too.
This was her dream house.
If she hadn't been in remission, I never would have gone through with it.
I just wish she was here to see it.
She's here.
Hey, buddy.
JAMIE: Don't worry, Dad.
We're gonna get through it, together.
It's all gonna be okay.
(car alarm beeping) (Jamie screams) (tires screeching) Alex. Alex!
(phone beeping) AUTOMATED VOICE: You have reached a number that is not in service.
If you feel you have reached this number in error, please check the number and try again.
Check the number? It's 911.
BUCK: Okay, so every unit is different, but I think I kind of like this one the best.
Nice. You should totally rent that apartment.
M-Me? Wh-Why...why would I?
Because I have my own apartment.
You sleep in my dining room.
Y-You don't think it's weird?
Yes. That's why you should get your own place.
Okay, fine. It's a little weird to go back to my apartment, but...
I'm not just gonna force myself out of it because...
I got stabbed, and it totally sucked.
But then I remembered something a wise man once said: "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." Ah, wise men of history: Aristotle, Solomon, Dr. King, Bueller, Bueller.
Don't mock me. I'm convalescing.
Anyways, Ferris Bueller only had one day off.
I have weeks of free time, and I'm determined to make the most of it.
Last time I almost died, I didn't get to have any fun at all.
Is that why you're turning all your clothes into index cards?
Not all of them.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to determine if this shirt sparks joy, and I did, and it doesn't.
And now I thank the shirt.
Thank you.
Okay.
You need therapy, Chim.
(laughs) MADDIE: I will still see my therapist.
I'll go to my support group, but I have to start putting little pieces of my life back together, and work is a very big piece.
It seems like, maybe, you're moving too fast.
You need time to heal.
I've been healing, for weeks.
I'm sick of resting, I'm tired of talking about my feelings, and I just want to go back to the real world.
Even if you're not ready?
Once my life is normal again, then I will feel normal again.
HEN: You both just almost died.
Now you're just gonna prance over to her place and pick her up for dinner like it never happened?
No. Maddie is coming over here to pick me up, because she is a modern woman.
And also, I'm pretty sure they couldn't get the bloodstains off that brick.
(laughs softly) So I guess Maddie still sparks joy?
Always.
BUCK: Okay, so where are you gonna take Chimney on your "second first date"?
I have no idea.
(chuckles) BOBBY: Don't panic, because panic can be more dangerous than flames, toxic fumes or a sucking chest wound.
Guys?
Cap's a little intense, huh?
Oh, he takes these talks very seriously.
BOBBY: And all you need are three numbers.
Can anyone tell me what they are?
ALL: 911!
Yes. Now, does anybody know what happens when you dial those numbers?
Harry Grant.
They call a fire truck.
Hmm. So much for playing it cool.
Well, who's doing that?
Our son.
He didn't want the other kids thinking he had the inside track just 'cause he knows the captain.
Oh, well, that went out the window as soon as he walked through the door.
(both laugh) And now, what if I told you that a big computer brain helps you when you dial 911?
It is called CAD, Computer Aided Dispatch.
Let's say you, Harry, call in an emergency. Can you name one?
The library sets on fire, and all our homework assignments are burned up.
(chuckles): Okay, there you go.
All right, so when you dial 911, the dispatcher types in your address into the computer, and then CAD automatically finds your school, then finds the nearest station and...
(alarm ringing) HEN: Station 118, Station 118, please dispatch a fire engine and an ambulance to the Meadowbrook School Library immediately.
Harry Grant didn't do his homework.
(laughter) BOBBY: All right, guys, who wants to check out the trucks?
ALL: Me!
All right.
Follow Buck and Eddie.
Come on, guys.
I want this side with me. Let's go, let's go!
Watch out. (laughs) Come on!
Yeah, seriously. There you go.
Great performance, sir. I enjoyed every nuance.
Oh, well, thank you, I guess I'm a method actor.
(laughs): Yeah.
Hey, what are you, on your lunch break, or you just love TED Talks for ten-year-olds?
Are you kidding me?
These tickets are harder to get than Hamilton.
(chuckles) Will I see you later?
Absolutely, you will.
Ooh.
All right, baby.
KYLE: I still can't believe your new dad's the captain.
That's so cool.
He's pretty badass.
Not just with, like, fires and stuff.
Like, during the earthquake, he saved, like, hundreds of people.
All we did was hand out bottled waters.
(siren wailing) (phone ringing) MADDIE: 911. What is your emergency?
No, ma'am, an ice bath will not help you break the baby's fever.
WOMAN: A steam shower?
Steam shower's not good, either.
It's only gonna raise her temperature.
Tell me your baby's name.
Jessalyn.
She's at 103.
103 is high, but not in the danger zone.
Is Jessalyn eating and producing urine?
Mm-hmm.
Then she's gonna be fine.
If the fever's there in an hour, take her to the ER.
Oh, thank God. Thank you.
You're welcome.
911. What is your emergency?
WOMAN 2: My husband.
He's choking on a shrimp tail.
Y-You're gonna want to get your hands under his sternum and squeeze as you lift.
(woman 2 grunting) (man coughing) It worked!
Oh.
I'm so glad. Last thing your husband needed was a shrimp tail stuck in his throat.
(cell phone vibrating) Look me in the eye.
What?
I'm checking on you.
Ugh.
Everyone is checking on me.
I would tell you that I'm fine, but you probably won't believe me, either.
How's Chimney?
He's good.
We're gonna finish what we started.
Oh, the-the first date that we never had.
Hope you have a good plan for the man that almost died for you.
Still working on it.
I'll think of some recommendations while I'm saving lives.
(chuckles) (phone ringing) 911. What's your emergency?
MAN: I need help.
Brakes gave out on my truck.
I had to use a turnout.
Have you been hurt?
Pretty sure my ankle's broken.
And I've made a hell of a mess of things.
I'm at Kanan, near the PCH.
Don't worry, sir. I'm sending you help right away.
(crackling, beeping) Sir?
Sir, can you hear me?
(electronic crackling) (indistinct muttering) (beeping) SUE: It's a level three outage.
The power is on, but the entire CAD system is down.
The digital phone lines are routed through the network, so no computers, no calls.
But the analog lines still work.
We're going old-school. Red for fire, white for police, yellow for medical.
Write down important details, figure out what resources you need, use the walkie to dispatch resources to the scene.
There are no blinking lights on the map.
So, from your caller, get cross streets and landmarks.
And if you are unfamiliar with where they are calling from, look it up.
(alarm ringing) Okay, everybody, we are in Tactical Emergency Mode.
That means we will not be at the station today.
We will be driving all around the district to make sure that we are ready for anything that comes our way.
Cap, you do realize we work here, right?
We're trained professionals, not fifth-graders.
Yeah, right?
Sorry.
This is a street atlas.
All of Los Angeles in one handy volume.
Maps on paper, people. And yes, they still make them.
Street numbers are located on the maps and also in the index.
EDDIE: Hey, Cap. You ever seen a breakdown like this before?
Once in St. Paul.
Blizzard took out the power grid around the call center and backup generator.
I've been through, like, three of these.
I'm surprised they don't happen more often, the way the city funds us.
Department's held together by chewing gum and spit.
Hey, come on, I like these old trucks.
Uh-huh. I like them when they run.
JOSH: It will be chaos.
Help each other through it.
Call out errors, correct mistakes.
See it, say it, repeat it.
We did it this way for 20 years.
We'll do it again today.
JOSH (over radio): 118 Engine and Rescue, please report your location.
BOBBY: We're on Granville, approaching Miracle Mile District from the west.
JOSH: Please proceed to 9590 Hillcrest.
Cross street is Meadows.
Vehicle collided with a 58-year-old cyclist, male.
Copy. 118, Battalion Seven en route.
So, you didn't do it there, where did you do it?
(news fanfare playing) Good morning, everybody.
Oh, come on.
We're learning that Metro L. A.'s 911 system has been hit with a system-wide outage.
We're gonna be posting alternate numbers.
We'll put them on the screen here for you and on our website.
Department staffers are also monitoring social media and urging you to use the hashtag "911-L. A." Now, officials are saying that only about 30% of these emergency calls are gonna be able to get through, so please only call 911...
Okay, this might be a better show.
...if it is a life-threatening emergency.
* That's great, it starts with an earthquake *
* Birds and snakes and aeroplanes *
* And Lenny Bruce is not afraid *
* Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn *
* World serves its own needs...* Get these cars routed around the scene and shut down these two lanes.
* With a fear of height, down, height...* Dispatch, this is 118. 122 is already on the scene.
JOSH: Copy that. Maintain Emergency Protocol.
* With the Furies breathing down your neck...* BOBBY: Copy that. 118 on the move.
Wait, is that the vehicle versus cyclist on Hillcrest?
I sent the 122. I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's gonna happen. Um, Vicky, Jeanette, Andre, start walking the floor and flag all duplicate calls.
Make sure one ends up on the boards. Got it?
Sure you don't want to take another three weeks off?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but we're not giving any tours today.
You should return your passes to the receptionist and reschedule.
MAN: Don't think my ASAC will like that.
(scoffs) You're FBI?
Anders is our data breach and recovery expert.
Nina is a critical infrastructure specialist.
I'm Devon, systems analyst, cyberterrorism.
So you think we've been hacked?
We're operating on that assumption.
ANDERS: Doesn't take much. In 2016, a single web address went viral on Twitter.
People clicked on it, and their phones started speed-dialing 911.
DEVON: The attack in Atlanta last year was traced back to Russian hackers.
The city spent more than $2.6 million trying to unlock their systems, rather than pay the ransom demand of $50,000 in Bitcoin.
Ransom demand?
Yes.
And that's what we're hoping for, because the moment they hit us with it, we'll be ready.
(elevator bell dings) (sighing): Okay, okay.
(strained grunting) Is it bad?
(chuckles) Please tell me it's not bad.
On a scale of one to ten, it's about a 40.
We're not gonna make it.
Ooh!
We'll be fine, Roger. We just got to get to the car...
Aah!
Whoa.
Did your water just break?
Yeah.
Yeah, broke.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Ooh!
Call 911. (yells) We've got an Uber on the way.
O-Okay, okay.
(cell phone dialing) AUTOMATED VOICE: You have reached a number that is not in service.
What do you mean, it's not in service?
How is 911 not in service? (panting) (line ringing) Thank God.
LINDA: 911. What's your emergency?
Yeah, my wife is having a baby.
Engine 118, Rescue 118, report to 550 San Vicente.
Woman in labor, geriatric pregnancy, contractions very close.
BOBBY: Copy that.
118 en route to 550 San Vicente.
(sirens wailing) (Sonia shouting) Need some pillows?
The contractions are right on top of each other.
This is not good.
(screaming) It's okay. I got it.
Where the hell is the ambulance?
(sirens wailing) Dispatch, this is 118.
There is nothing here.
No pregnant woman?
There's no building. It's an empty lot.
LINDA: Stand by, 118.
Hey, Linda, did you say San Vicente?
Yeah. Woman in labor in the lobby of a high-rise.
Yeah, it's the wrong San Vicente. There's three.
118, you're gonna need to proceed to San Vicente, east of the Miracle Mile District.
Nearest cross street is Sixth.
BOBBY: Copy that.
He's ready.
I know, honey, I know.
He wants out!
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Where the hell have you guys been?
We are fighting a system outage, sir.
We apologize for the delay. Hen, you're up.
Eddie, start fluids.
(stammering) We can't just have the baby here in the lobby.
That's not how this is supposed to happen.
Roger, this is pretty much the way it's happened throughout human his...tory. (groans) Hi. I'm Hen. What's your name?
(panting): Sonia. 39 weeks pregnant.
38 years old, which makes me a geriatric pregnancy.
God, I hate that word.
Word doesn't matter.
You're still gonna get a baby out of it.
I can't believe I'm finally gonna meet him. Here.
In the lobby. (laughs) That's all right. You're doing great, okay?
Now, on this next contraction, we're gonna push, okay, Sonia?
(groaning) Sonia? Sonia?
There's something wrong with the baby.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Your baby's fine.
You'll-you'll be able to see for yourself in just a minute.
No!
No, this was a mistake.
All of it.
Roger was right to panic. Look, we can't do this.
I can't...I can't do this. I shouldn't have this child.
No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Sonia, look at me.
Sonia, look at me, look at me, look at me.
Look at me, look at me.
All you got to do is push.
All you need to do, push.
Push.
(screaming) Good.
Good, good, good. Keep pushing!
Keep pushing!
(screaming continues) Keep pushing!
He's coming! He's coming!
(baby crying) He's here!
He's here!
He's here!
(applause) Yeah. Yes.
Baby's got a set of pipes. (chuckles) We're gonna take you to the warmest place in this lobby, okay? (chuckles) Which is gonna be right here...
BUCK: Hen.
Hen, I got the baby.
Sonia. Sonia?
What's happening? What's happening?
It's okay. Roger, Roger.
What's happening? What?
Roger, Roger. Hey, hey, hey.
Listen, she is in good hands.
Okay? Right now, he needs yours.
Blood pressure went off a cliff.
HEN: Sonia, can you hear me?
Cyanosis.
(baby continues crying) Can someone please tell me what's happening here?
BUCK: Your wife has gone into shock.
I lost her pulse.
HEN: She's in cardiac arrest.
I'm starting compressions.
BOBBY: Okay, let's get her transported to L. A. General now.
Hey, Cap, we're gonna need another ambulance for the baby.
Dispatch, this is Engine 118.
DISPATCH: Stand by, 118.
No more standing by. Guys, let's get her on the gurney. Let's go.
(sirens wailing) (baby crying) BOBBY: Hen, it's been 12 minutes.
Let's switch.
I got it.
Hen, let me take over.
No, I got it.
She's not dying because somebody blew a fuse.
Come on, Sonia. I know you're a fighter.
BOBBY: She is. She was. She was fine when we got there, and then...
Sudden despair and fear and anxiety.
BOBBY: Birth was going like clockwork, even for a geriatric pregnancy.
Then rapid loss of BP.
Amniotic embolism, Cap.
She's hemorrhaging.
The hospital needs to prep for this.
It's a massive transfusion protocol.
BOBBY: Well, we can't radio, but we can still call.
(line ringing) OPERATOR: L. A. General. Operator.
This is Fire Captain Bobby Nash.
I need the ER charge nurse on call.
We've got a patient coming your way.
Rapid transfusion on standby.
Come on, Sonia.
How long has she been down?
Uh, 14...no, 15 minutes.
Okay. Call it.
Come on, Sonia.
Hen.
Come on, Sonia.
Hen.
Hen.
(panting) (monitor flatlining) How is she?
Guys.
What's wrong?
I am so sorry.
You were right.
He's perfect.
I wish you could see him.
I know I was scared and worried that we weren't ready for this, and I am damn sure not ready to do this without you, but I will.
I'm gonna figure it out.
(baby cooing) (baby fusses) (monitor beeping) (baby crying) She's got a pulse.
Go, go! Get her inside!
Let's go.
Watch the left.
Hallway's good.
All right.
(indistinct chatter) Thank you.
(gasping) That was amazing.
That was a miracle.
Right there.
That's not what I'm looking for.
Okay. Uh, right here. Great little Tuscan spot.
Has a garden that's not really a garden, so you still feel like you're sitting outside.
Also, string lights.
Mm, that sounds intimate.
I thought you wanted intimate.
No, I want special.
Rachel McAdams special or Reese Witherspoon special?
I don't think that I know the difference.
Fun and flighty or serious and heartfelt?
No, I don't want serious.
Oh. Then what do you want?
TERRY: I've already run every antivirus protocol we have.
ANDERS: Did you scan for foreign data packets?
Every scan turns up zero.
Well, that's not surprising.
Some of these cyber-thugs can be pretty sophisticated.
Pretty sure, if it were a malware attack, I would have found it by now.
(exhales) (clears throat) Mister...?
Flores, Terry.
Mr. Flores.
I'm sure you're very good at your job.
But this goes beyond tech support.
Now, please.
Let us do what we do.
Sure.
Hey, what's that?
It's electrical fire.
Eleventh and Margo, low-priority call.
Eleventh and Margo.
Okay, let's refuel.
We're back out there in five minutes.
Hen, can you check the ambulance and top off anything that needs resupply?
Copy that, Cap.
Thank you.
(faint chatter) Harry?
Harry.
What're you doing here?
Where's your dad?
We had a fight. He was so mad.
Then I ran away.
He doesn't know you're here?
(softly): Okay.
No, you can't call him.
Harry, your dad's gonna be worried sick about you.
I got to let him know you're okay.
No, you don't understand. He was really mad.
There you are.
How did you find me?
Next time, don't tweet from your secret location.
Get in the car.
Michael, I was gonna call you. We'd just gotten back.
Michael. Michael.
I don't know what you two had a fight about, but Harry seemed real shook up.
Bobby...
do I strike you as the type of man that has fights with his ten-year-old son?
No, I...
Well, then let me fill you in on actually what happened.
Harry was playing with his friend Kyle.
On Kyle's front lawn.
They decided that it would be fun to set a fire and then try to put it out.
Because fighting fires is so cool.
Oh, God. I...Is everybody okay?
Yeah, the kids are fine. The yard, not so much.
But I don't think I need to tell you the ways in which that could have gone horribly wrong.
No, I cannot believe that Harry would do that.
I will talk to him.
You will not.
I'll talk to him. That's my job, not yours.
You've done enough.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Excuse me?
Let me tell you something -- I don't like what's happening to my son.
He used to care about video games and sports and-and comic books.
And ever since you came along, the big damn hero, making him feel like your kind of life is the only one worth having.
Filling his head with reckless ideas.
What we do here is not reckless.
Might be difficult to understand when you've never done the job.
I get it, Bobby.
You're awesome. More awesome than me.
But hear me on this: I am not interested in raising my son in your image.
That is not what I'm doing.
I'm just trying to be there for Harry.
Because I'm not?
I'm only with him half the time now, right?
Maybe that makes me half a father.
It's still half more than you.
GPS VOICE: In .2 miles, turn right.
Then make another right.
That is the fourth right in a row!
The freaking nav is sending me in a circle.
What is going on today?
WOMAN: That's what I'm telling you. 911 is out. Totally gone.
Accidents everywhere. Traffic's going crazy.
Oh, so it's a day that ends in "Y" in L. A.
(gasps) What the...
(explosion) (screams) (tires screech) (horn blaring) (coughing) DAVID: Alex!
Alex!
(car alarms blaring) DWIGHT: This is a live picture from Newscopter Eight.
We're over Doheny Park there, and it's been hit by multiple explosions. Now, we're not sure what's causing these explosions, and we're still waiting for the first responders to arrive at the scene.
We are getting reports from bystanders, though, that some residents were at home...
(line ringing) Yeah, Buck. Where are you guys?
Uh, we are crossing Robertson for the 320th time.
Get over to Doheny Park, man.
The whole damn neighborhood's on fire.
Looks like it's a gas main break.
You heard it on the scanner?
No, I'm watching it on the news right now.
Nobody's over there, Buck.
Not a single unit.
Hey, Cap! Uh, Doheny Park is going up in flames!
Chim thinks it's a gas main break.
We're close, right?
Close enough. Let's do it.
(siren blaring) (indistinct chatter) BOBBY: Dispatch, this is Captain 118.
We're at Doheny Park.
Multiple residential structure fires.
Send everything you can.
JOSH: Copy that, 118.
I'm trying to find additional resources for you, but you might be on your own for the next 15, maybe 20 minutes.
BOBBY: Copy that.
(siren wailing) Help! Help! You got to help!
Cap!
My son! He's trapped upstairs!
Do you know where? Which room?
No, no, I haven't seen him.
Cap, I see him! Upstairs window!
(yells) Sir! Sir! Two!
All right, get the ladder up to the house. Go.
All right.
I'll check the driver, Cap!
Louis.
Go for Louis.
Jones.
Yeah, Cap.
Go door to door. Everyone gets evacuated.
Hen is doing triage.
DAVID: You got to save him!
BOBBY: Sir, just let us work.
Cap!
Yeah?
Hydrant's gone. The only water we got is in the truck.
It's not even enough to put out one house.
Okay.
Keep trying dispatch.
Gas company needs to shut down Doheny Park.
I want a two-mile radius around Lambourne Place.
Two miles.
Copy that.
(sighs) Okay, okay.
Uh...there's no water. They got no backup.
NEWSCASTER: Looks like they hit a pipe. And just thinking ahead...
Backup.
...it could be a huge problem for first responders to deal with when they arrive here at the scene.
(line ringing) That's the only hydrant out there on the street...
MAN: Hello?
Hey, Tommy.
Hey, man.
Yeah, it's me, Howie.
Are you still with the 217?
(screaming, frantic chatter) (coughing) Dad!
I'm over here! Help!
Dad!
BUCK: We got you, big guy.
Help!
I just need you to hold on, okay?
I'm coming for you.
(coughing) Go, go, go!
Almost there.
I told you, everything's gonna be fine.
(metallic grinding) No, no, no!
(grunting) (gasps) Buck!
(grunts) ALEX: Help!
(yells) (whooshing, clattering) You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good. Come on.
Oh, hey, uh, Eddie.
Eddie, what are you doing?
I feel like, if I ever did that, you would yell at me.
WOMAN: Get him out!
(panting) (coughing) (grunting) Alex!
(flame whooshing) (coughing) Alex!
Alex, where are you, buddy?
(coughing) Uh, Cap, I got him. Alive but unconscious.
I'm prepping for evac.
Cap, gas guys just showed up. They're shutting it down.
All neighbors are present and accounted for.
Two more engines are rolling in, but it makes no sense if there's no water pressure.
(explosive booming) (creaking) (grunts) (gasping) Alex!
(grunting) (coughing) (inhales deeply) Cap! Negative on evac.
Pinned down, south side of the house.
I'm gonna take an extinguisher!
If I can make that jump, I can help Eddie!
No, wait.
(airplane engine roaring) Wait, is that...
Incoming! Everybody, take cover!
Under the trucks now! Now! Go, go!
BOBBY: Hunker down. 217 is inbound.
Seriously?
(flame whooshes) (coughs, grunts) BOBBY: Get under the trucks! Under the trucks! Now!
Under, under!
Here!
Hurry! Run, run!
(grunting) Go! Clear, clear, clear!
Hen, Hen, Hen, Hen, Hen! Hen, Hen, Hen!
Stay down!
* (gasping, grunting) Eddie, do you copy?
(sirens approaching) Alex?
(grunting, panting) (Alex coughing) Oh! Oh!
Oh, thank God.
Oh, you're...Hey, buddy.
What's up with the Spider-Man routine?
I don't know. I just did it.
And prayed a lot.
Yeah, it looks like someone was listening.
CHIMNEY: Yes!
You are welcome. You are welcome.
Ow. Ow. (chuckles) REPORTER (on TV): And a C130 supertanker with Cal Fire coming in...
SUE: So, nothing?
Still?
We'll keep digging.
Well, drop the shovel. The system's fine.
MADDIE: The electrical fire -- 11th and Margo, low-priority call -- wasn't so low-priority after all.
Something about the address sounded familiar, so I asked Terry about it.
It's where our communications equipment lives.
The backup generator overheated.
Knocked out the power, took everything offline.
No ransom, no revenge, no terrorism.
It just...
Broke.
Never occurred to us to ask.
(beeping) MAN: Yes!
(others cheer) We're back.
(door opens, closes) Hey, baby.
Do you know what happened to the Andersons' front yard?
Looks like it's burned to a crisp.
You should ask Harry.
I wasn't home when it happened.
Hmm.
Hey, um, I heard 911 was down.
That must have been crazy.
Oh, yeah. It was a trying day.
I don't think I have it in me to cook.
We should order something.
Harry's already on it.
HARRY: Surprise, I'm making dinner for you.
ATHENA: I see.
Waffles. Your favorite.
What did you do?
(cell phone vibrating) I thought you were headed out.
I didn't make a reservation.
We talked about it all day, and I never picked a damn restaurant.
Well, you were a little busy.
Or maybe you're not ready.
(sighs) I just need to leave what happened behind me.
I'm never gonna be able to move forward...
You know, when people break a leg, no one says, "Hey, just walk it off." Because everybody knows that ignoring an injury only compounds the damage.
I'm not ignoring it. I've been talking about it.
And...dealing with it.
But are you letting yourself feel it?
What you've been through is a lot more complicated than a broken bone.
But the advice is the same.
Pretending you're not hurt, it's not the same thing as healing.
BOBBY: There was no warning sign. It just broke.
The worst possible moment.
Eh, budget cuts.
And the way we're going, half the city is gonna be held together with paper clips and duct tape.
Hen thinks it's chewing gum and spit.
(chuckles) Well, I'm afraid that you're gonna be down a ladder for a few days.
And I'll bring in a backup.
But, you know, there's a reason it's a backup.
Paper clips and duct tape?
I could throw in some chewing gum if that'd make you feel better.
Thanks, Marty.
Yeah, well, still, you got it done.
Even with a bum ladder.
That's not nothing.
Equipment breaks, we don't.
Now, that's a T-shirt.
Hope it's not a bad time.
Around here, that changes by the minute.
I thought we should talk.
Sure.
You want some coffee?
There's pie.
I'm sorry.
I was out of line.
I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.
Definitely not in here.
Well, your timing was maybe not ideal.
All right, but listen, if I'm overstepping...
I'm sorry. I will back off.
Because the last thing I want to do is get between a father and his kids.
And I know that, usually.
But today, I overheard Harry bragging about his cool new dad, and I'm not gonna lie, it stung a little.
Look, he's ten. I think that he was just impressed by all the shiny trucks and equipment.
And I think, if you bring him to a job site, show him a crane, you'll be even cooler.
Maybe.
But he was mad at me today, and he ran here, to you.
Well, I don't think it's because he thinks of me as his dad.
I think it's because I'm not.
I'm not the guy who tells him to finish his homework or grounds him because he's done something wrong.
I'm just Best Buddy Bobby, nothing but fun.
(laughs) What?
Really? Is that how you see yourself?
No, no.
It's something that Athena says to me, that I am always trying to win them over, trying to be their friend, not their stepparent.
And she's right.
I am...overcompensating.
For what?
For not being you.
Wow.
Well, I wouldn't get too worked up over that, 'cause I am definitely no fun at all.
I mean, ask Harry or Glenn.
It's just...
I...
We broke up.
Are you sure you don't want a piece of pie?
Uh, maybe.
If there's ice cream.
All right.
You get some ice cream.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that. It's just...
Athena, she, uh...
she didn't tell me.
Well, Athena doesn't know. Not yet.
I-I've been trying to figure out a way to tell her.
"Remember the time I blew up your life "and left you for somebody else?
Well, whoops." Yeah, that's maybe not the best way in.
For the last three days, I have been feeling like a damn fool, and-and...
and then I started acting like one.
Well, that wasn't my finest moment, either.
You struck a nerve.
The reason that I don't put my foot down with your kids is that I'm always afraid they're gonna tell me that I'm not their father.
Because I'm not.
I'm nobody's father.
But you're about to become a stepfather.
So we have got to work on your bad-cop routine.
Present a united front, all right, or they will divide and conquer us for sure.
All right, deal.
Deal.
Do you need to talk about...
No.
Okay.
Guess maybe next time, I should pick the restaurant, huh?
(laughs) I'm so sorry.
I meant to make a reservation.
That's okay. You had, like, a really crazy first day back, so...
Not as crazy as my first day there, but yeah.
So, I think it's supposed to start raining tomorrow, probably through the weekend.
That'd be nice. (sighs) We could just stay at home and catch up on some sleep.
You're not sleeping okay?
No, I-I am.
All I want to do is sleep.
I just want to pull the covers over my head and-and wait until the world makes sense again.
But I know that I can't do that.
I have to get up and go to work and move forward.
I'm not okay.
Neither of us are.
But I wanted to be. I wanted, uh...
I wanted this date to be perfect to make up for the one we didn't get.
But I think that's asking a little too much of a bowl of pasta. (laughs) I hate my apartment building.
I hate just walking out of my front door.
And I tried coming home, because every time I...
I just see you laying there.
Yesterday, I want to get my mail, and one of my neighbors came up behind me, and I, uh...I'm really not sure which one of us was freaked out more, me or him.
(both laugh) This is never gonna be the same, is it?
Whatever it is that we were about to have, or...
We're never getting it back.
(quietly): No.
I should go.
Hang on a second. Hang on.
We're not saying good-bye.
We just need a minute.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
(door opens, closes)
 @@@@@@
Bye-bye now. Have a great day.
Um...
This is really just too much.
Aw, speech.
No speech.
Just, thank you.
You've all been so wonderful over the years.
We've weathered many storms together, including the scandal in our financial services division, which I'm proud to say did not affect this branch in the least.
And although my friends in corporate did not see fit to name me manager of the year at the retreat in Costa Mesa, it was an honor to be nominated.
(watch beeps) Nina, it's time. Thank you very much.
(beeps) Thank you.
Mr. Prentiss?
Oh.
Harrison. You startled me.
I just wanted to say good luck and enjoy your retirement.
Oh. Thank you, Harrison.
Did you change your hair?
Same cut. Same color.
Sign here.
I understand we're gonna be missing you around here.
Mm? Yes.
It's been good working with you, sir.
Thanks.
BILLY: You know...
if you're gonna take over for old fussbudget, you should probably stop flirting so shamelessly with your delivery guy.
Mm. (giggles) (choking) Billy?
Oh, my God. Oh.
Somebody call 911!
Mr. Prentiss! Mr. Prentiss!
Mr. Prentiss?
(gasps) Mr. Prentiss!
(siren wailing) (horn honking) (indistinct chatter) HEN: I got it.
(Buck speaks indistinctly) Hey! Hey!
Can you tell me what's happening?
Uh, don't know, sir. Just got here.
I can see that.
Do you know what the call was?
Two people down in the bank.
Down?
Like dead down? Injured down? Depressed down?
M-My partner's in there.
Was your partner exhibiting any kind of symptoms of anything before entering the bank?
What? No.
Does he have any allergies or medical conditions?
No! He eats better than I do. He's-he's pescatarian.
Okay, well, uh, you just, uh, sit tight!
Like I have a choice!
Airway's clear. No MedicAlert bracelet.
Jaws not clenched. Tongue is neutral.
All right. Get him started on O2. Ten liters.
You said there's a second patient?
(gurgling) Same as the courier out front.
Exhibiting extreme muscle spasms.
Cap, pupils are dilated.
I don't know what we're looking at here.
Could be a nerve agent.
You've seen that before?
I've been trained for it.
Symptoms all line up.
The fact that we have multiple people down.
I can't say for sure until we run some tests.
All right, Hen. Back away.
Everybody, stop what you're doing right now. Chimney, Buck.
Step away. Step away.
I need everybody's attention.
We are now preparing for a possible chemical exposure incident. That means nobody in, nobody out.
(people murmuring) We can't risk spreading whatever may be present here.
(beeping) Cap...
Hen! Hen!
Hen! Hen!
Wait -- no. Stay calm, sir. Stay calm!
I'm with LAFD. We got to get you out of here!
No!
EDDIE: Help!
Hen, do you copy?
(panting) I'm here, Cap.
Making myself comfortable.
Not too comfortable.
How do we open this?
Uh, we don't. The vault operates on a time lock.
It won't reopen until the start of business tomorrow.
What if it's an emergency?
There is a number for the vault company on Mr. Prentiss's desk.
Show me.
Hen, how's the air in there?
Hen, do you copy?
Hen, do you copy?
Yes, sir. Yes.
Uh, well, the EMTs have been here for a while, but LAPD just showed up.
What the hell?
Yes, sir, I'm here.
What's happening?
Uh, what's happening is that a whole new squad of guys just showed up in, like, serious hazmat gear.
(helicopter blades whirring) Commander Bowman. Hazardous Materials.
What are we looking at?
Three victims down, all showing signs of possible chemical exposure.
Two out of our control, trapped inside that vault, including one of our own.
Third victim was here making a money delivery.
He was likely the first affected.
Could be he was delivering more than money.
And the others?
Still not symptomatic.
I need gross decontamination stations set up!
Clear and prep these people for transport.
And I need full environmental testing of the entire premises!
What's the status with the vault?
Vault company is sending a technician.
They're also trying to open it remotely.
What's the chances of that working?
Uh, remote.
But the technician should be here within hours.
Not even a scratch.
Okay, two people, 72 breaths a minute, we need to drill into that vault and get some air flowing.
Doors are wired, Cap. Running hot.
We need to cut the power.
Yeah, I'm trying to get the answers.
Hang on, hang on. Hang on one second.
Hey! Hey!
(horn honking) What's going on?
I can't hear you! I got this thing on my head!
What? I can't leave this truck!
The window does not roll down.
Uh, uh, okay!
(indistinct chatter) Okay, we're going dark.
Chimney, hit it!
Right this way.
(indistinct radio chatter) EDDIE: We're through!
Okay, Chim, power's back up.
Buck, crank the O2.
(air hissing) We're wide open, Cap.
So, now what?
BOBBY: Now we get in there.
BUCK: How are we gonna do that?
We're gonna crack this safe.
(indistinct chatter) (phone vibrates) Hey, Bobby. Everything okay?
What do you know about bank vaults?
Well, I've put in a few.
Ever take one down?
Bobby, what's wrong?
I've got two sick people trapped inside the vault here at Pacific Federal in Westchester.
And I don't have time to wait for a locksmith because one of them is Hen.
I need the blueprints for this building.
I got to find a way inside.
Oh, Bobby, I-I don't have access to that kind of thing.
You have to put in a request to the office of building and permits.
We don't have time for that, Michael.
Okay. All right. I-I do know a guy that works in that office.
Chuck.
He, uh...likes me.
Well, like him back.
Oh, God.
I think Billy's dead.
They just put Billy in an ambulance.
(siren wailing) I don't know.
They're putting people through those showers.
No. I didn't say "plague." Though it could be, couldn't it?
It could very well be a plague.
Okay, yes, sir. I'll take a breath.
I'm breathing.
Should I be breathing?
The money's fine.
MICHAEL: Okay, Bobby, I got it.
Uh, though now I am going to a Sondheim concert at the Bowl on Friday.
Sorry.
So, your bank.
Well, it wasn't always a bank.
Cornerstone laid in '65...
and housed a insurance company.
Pacific Federal picked up the first floor in '73.
So this vault wasn't always here?
Exactly.
But the south wall...it's original.
And it looks like they just built the vault right into it.
Okay, we start drilling here...
and here.
Creating a crumple zone.
Exactly.
BUCK: Then what?
Then, I have an idea.
But we've got to soften it up first.
Soften up a foot of concrete?
BUCK: Yeah, it beats three layers of tempered steel. Let's do it.
(indistinct chatter) (helicopter blades whirring) (drill whirring) (coughing) All right, let's start smashing this wall in.
(monitor beeping rapidly) WOMAN: Crash unit needed in the OR.
(indistinct chatter) Give me some oxygen, stat.
(gasping) MAN: He needs CPR.
Okay, Chim, I need you back inside, eyes on the vault cam.
If we're compromising their safety in any way, you got to let me know.
Copy that, Cap.
All right.
(indistinct radio chatter) (monitor beeping rapidly) All right, keep bagging him.
No pulse. Call it.
(monitor flatlining) WOMAN: Time of death, 2142.
CHIMNEY: All right, I got eyes on them both, Cap.
Okay, here we go!
(rattling) (grinding) The wench isn't gonna do it, Cap.
(ringtone playing) This is Captain Nash.
Okay, thank you.
Patient zero, the armored car courier, just died at the hospital.
They know what it was yet?
No. They did say that no one else is exhibiting symptoms.
Yeah, no one else except them.
Oh, screw this.
All right, Buck...
BUCK: No, stand back!
(creaking) (cracking) Oh, look at this.
You got to be kidding me.
Now they get remote access?
Hey, guys. Seriously?
Hen.
Hen! Can you hear me?
(groans) Chim?
(chuckles) You're gonna be okay. I'll check on him.
Someone please call Karen.
Already taken care of.
She's gonna meet you at Mercy General.
I don't get it. She doesn't appear to be symptomatic anymore; bank manager was up and talking, too.
Because it wasn't a nerve agent.
Uh, Chief Bowman said all those tests came back negative, no environmental toxins whatsoever.
CHIMNEY: So, what the hell was it?
I have no idea.
At least this guy was finally able to get out of here.
So that might be the weirdest day I've had since joining the LAFD and we have had a few.
Seriously, it was like a bank robbery with no robbers.
(siren wailing) Step away from the vehicle.
Can I help you, Detective?
You and your people just stay where we can see you, Captain.
Excuse me, you want to tell me what's going on?
Maybe you can tell me.
MERCER: $300,000.
WASH: Tucked away on the 118 ladder truck.
Any idea how it got there?
No, why would I?
MERCER: You're with the 118.
And you were at the bank when it was stolen.
If by "at the bank" you mean that I was unconscious and I was locked away in a vault, yeah.
And I wasn't alone.
Um...
I'm sorry, this is so embarrassing.
(burps) The doctors say I'm fine.
Still feeling the aftereffects?
(burps) Do you have any idea what happened?
The call came in a little after 5:00.
911. What is your emergency?
Report of two men experiencing seizures and vomiting. I dispatched an RA unit to the scene.
MERCER: "Looks like our money trouble is over." That's the text your sister sent you right after she took the 911 call.
You care to explain?
Her landlord finally agreed to let her out of her lease and refund her security deposit.
He'd been giving her some grief about it.
Still nothing from the landlord?
Not since he said he had to consult his lawyers.
What's all that?
Uh, decorations for Chimney's welcome back party.
Hen is insisting, don't know why.
Chimney said he didn't want anyone to make a big deal.
I really hope he has a great first day back.
You want me to tell him that?
No.
(engine starts) You expect us to believe you just happened to take this call?
And you just happened to dispatch your brother's squad to the scene?
It happens more than you'd think.
We're like a family.
I mean, a big, messy, extended family, but we take care of each other, we support each other.
You know? We have each other's backs.
Conspire.
"Conspire"?
Conspire.
You conspired with your fiancée's ex-husband to steal the blueprints to that bank.
Not stolen.
(laughs) You think they did what now?
People request building plans all the time.
Architects, contractors...
Terrorists.
Don't think I ever said the word "terrorists." But you were the first to suggest it might be a nerve agent.
And everyone figured you knew what you were talking about.
Coming from the military and all.
It was part of my training.
How to spot it. How to respond.
We had to improvise.
You do that a lot? Improvise?
It's part of the job.
See the problem, solve the problem.
I was trying to help a friend.
Your ex's new squeeze is your friend?
Hen is my friend.
I mean, yes, Bobby's a friend, too.
Hell, they're all my friends.
I don't really know him.
Someone said I seemed stressed?
Who?
Cranky.
I said she was a little cranky that morning.
Buck, you're lopsided.
Should we even be doing this?
Yes.
Chimney said he didn't want us to make a big deal about his first day back.
He didn't mean it.
That's way too low.
I'm just saying, maybe we should respect the guy's wishes.
Okay, you know what we're not doing? Respecting wishes.
We're hanging a banner, we're having cake and we're gonna show him how much we love him.
Lower.
Ah, there she is.
Good as used.
Don't tell me that, Marty.
MARTY: Nah, she's a tough old bird.
State-of-the-art ladder rig.
So you replaced it?
Ah, replaced what matters.
You're good to go.
Thanks, Marty.
You bet, Chief.
Ah, this is festive. Need a hand?
Oh, well, I would ask you to blow up balloons.
I mean, I know you got the wind, but tying it would be a thing, huh?
Oh, because the arthritis?
Not gonna be a problem.
Oh, well, I'll be damned.
Steroid shot's kicking in, huh?
No, ma'am.
I finally took my crazy sister's advice, I went to see her acupuncture guy.
You went alternative medicine, Marty. I'm shocked.
Oh, don't be. That didn't work either.
But he then recommended me to a kind of witch doctor.
You won't believe what he put me on.
ATHENA: Hey, y'all.
I'm not too late, am I?
BOBBY: You're right on time.
Oh!
Okay. Yes.
HEN: Let's see.
Oh, thank you.
Kind of a letdown, isn't it? Last time we had a cake in the shape of his head with a licorice rebar through it.
Yeah, but this time he only got stabbed.
I imagine it's hard.
Your wife losing her job at JPL.
KAREN: They said they're sick of Mars.
Who gets sick of going to a planet?
In outer space?
Not me.
You're the only person I know with a job cooler than mine.
Yeah, except I don't have a job.
Because Mars is apparently a snoozefest.
First the lunar mission, now my Mars project.
Funding is drying up everywhere.
I'm worried. We just spent all that money on the new roof and...
we've got Denny's daycare.
Yeah, kids in general are expensive.
But they're worth it, right?
Yeah, o-okay, maybe I picked up a few extra shifts here and there, but it's not a big deal.
SHANNON: It is a big deal.
Surfing lessons? $150 an hour?
The guy's giving me a discount.
Carla, the private school, physical therapy, the after-school program.
Eddie, I know what all that costs.
It's under control. Don't worry.
Every time we talk about money, you tell me not to worry.
Guess what, I worry.
Ugh. Don't.
Ready.
MERCER: 300 grand does solve a lot of problems.
I've got two full-time jobs, firefighter and dad.
I don't have time to plan a robbery.
Six weeks at home, guy like you, what you do for a living, you must've been climbing the walls.
More like redecorating them. (chuckles) MERCER: Sounds like you had a lot of time on your hands, to think.
To plan?
You mean to plot? Who did I plot with?
No one on my team would do this. I am sure of it.
You moved here two, three years ago.
Minnesota, right?
Mm-hmm.
Left there under a bit of a cloud, didn't you, Captain?
Truth is, you don't know the people you work with, and they don't know you, do they, Captain Nash?
BUCK: But I trust him.
I trust his gut.
So when he said we needed to get into that vault, yeah, I believed him.
You chose to run into that vault, Firefighter Wilson, believing there was a nerve agent present. Why would you do that?
Because it's my job.
Or maybe you were providing a distraction so one of your friends can do a different kind of job.
SAM: I don't know what happened.
I did what the firefighter said.
The armored car driver?
I thought he couldn't leave the truck.
He said I was in danger. I had to get decontaminated.
Look, I was scared.
I did not know they were gonna rob the truck.
Wait, so the money came from the armored car?
Not the vault?
But I was in the vault the whole time. There's no way that's me.
No, you were the distraction.
Getting everyone to look over there, so no one's noticing the man emptying the armored car over here.
So who's your partner?
I'm so confused. Can you start over?
You sure about this?
I'm sure about clearing my name.
You were inside the vault the whole time, out like a light.
Your name is gonna clear itself.
The mystery man was right there.
Yellow splash suit. I. D.'d himself as a firefighter.
Led the driver away from the armored truck, filled some disposal bags with the green.
That's what us bank robbers call the money, the "dough-re-mi." Thank you.
I'm sorry, we're closed. Oh!
You're the firefighter who went back into the vault.
How are you feeling?
Like it never even happened.
I wish I could say the same. Come.
Uh, we'll be closed for at least a week.
Your Captain Nash went a little "Hulk smash" on the vault.
He was really worried about you.
I don't really remember much.
That's why I'm here, hoping to jog my memory.
Is your manager around?
Oh, Mr. Prentiss, um, he doesn't work here anymore.
That was his last day.
Uh, the day of the robbery was his last day?
Was that a planned thing?
Retirement.
26 years.
Oh.
I feel bad. He was so close to making it out.
What do you mean?
He had a fear -- a phobia, really -- of getting locked in the vault.
He was always talking about these stories he heard.
I think that Florida kid was the last straw.
He put in for retirement right after that.
You said Florida?
Maybe it's lucky you guys were unconscious.
You don't remember being locked inside.
Would it be okay if I took a look in there?
Follow me.
Inventory protocols.
We're moving all the boxes to another branch until the repairs are done.
ATHENA: Hey, you okay?
(beeping) He was right here, and-and I ran in.
(gurgling) Stay calm. Stay calm, sir.
'Thena.
What is it?
Go ahead.
Can't believe we missed that.
Maybe we didn't miss anything.
Firefighter Wilson's the one who found it, right?
Check the tape. She didn't plant it.
I was with her the whole time.
And why were you revisiting the scene of the crime?
So I could remember. He touched my face.
Franklin, the-the bank manager, he touched my face when I went in there t-to pull him out.
That's how he delivered the toxins, whatever-whatever that was. Maybe it's in the bottle.
W-W-Wait. You're saying the bank manager was in on it?
Did you know that was his last day?
MERCER: Yeah.
He put in for retirement right before Christmas.
Yeah, and right after he saw this.
You know how those firefighters got the kid out?
Drilled a hole in the vault wall.
They also had to cut the power to do it, just like we did.
Check every single box in this room again.
Is there a problem, Ms. Wolcott?
Box 725 is supposed to have $6 million worth of diamonds in it, not the recycling.
Who else had access to that box?
(pounding on door) Franklin Prentiss!
(pounding on door) LAPD.
We need to ask you some more questions.
Ugh, I hate this case.
WASH: Looks like he was headed out when he collapsed.
Out of the country, you mean?
Any sign of the diamonds?
Nothing about this case has been that easy.
His accomplice probably killed him and took the stones.
So where are they, Firefighter Wilson?
Seriously?
May, Harry, hurry it up.
Mrs. Anderson's waiting outside.
I thought Dad was picking us up.
Your father and I are going to have a very busy day today.
HARRY: Dad didn't say anything.
Mm-hm-hmm. It's a surprise.
MAY: Mom, what's going on?
Who are they?
Friends from work. Come on, now.
Off you go. Have a good day.
Sergeant Grant...I'm awfully sorry.
Let me see the warrant.
Fresh coffee's in the kitchen.
You were expecting us?
I know the drill, detective.
I assume you're hitting everyone at once.
They gonna be expecting us, too?
You think I'd spoil your surprise?
It ain't my party.

Oh, come on. You don't think...
It's just this business of turning over every rock to look under it.

Hey.
I need to borrow Harry's computer.
They confiscated mine. You have any idea where it is?
Probably in the same evidence lockup downtown as yours.
Wait, what? They took his, too?
The hell...What are they thinking? He-He's robbing banks and playing Minecraft?
Listen, I don't know.
Like father, like son, I guess.
Tell me you didn't spend the better part of your day helping my fiancé bust open a vault?
We were trying to save Hen.
Thank you for that, by the way.
You got it.
I think.
(phone vibrating) (sighs) It's the hospital.
Hello? Yes, this is she.
Place looks pretty good. Wh-What happened -- you-you clean up after they left?
Mm-mmm.
Police were very careful.
(phone chimes) (Michael chuckles) You mean terrified...
Ah.
of you.
(chuckles) They got my tox report back.
You'll never believe what they found.
Scorpion venom.
I feel robbed. How in the hell did you know that?
It was in the hand sanitizer that you found in the vault.
Uh, what is that supposed to mean?
I have no idea. (laughs) But...you do.
HEN: Yeah.
I know who did this.
Hey, Marty, thanks for coming.
Hey. Yeah, I heard you guys were having trouble with the ladder.
Was starting to think you guys, uh, don't know how to use it.
(truck door opens) Well, you know how we operate.
All our procedures and protocols.
BUCK: But maybe you could show us some tricks.
Yeah, you seem to know more about these trucks than we do.
Like, where to hide $300,000 in cash.
(laughs) What are you guys talking about?
How are your hands, Marty?
That alternative medicine still working?
WASH: Marty Collins.
You're under arrest for bank robbery and murder.
Murder? Who'd I kill?
WASH: The armored car courier -- he died from an allergic reaction to scorpion venom.
That's what's in the bottle, in concentrated gel form.
MERCER: That's what you've been using to combat your arthritis.
Sorry, I totally had to google this.
"The iberiotoxin blocks the potassium channels that allow arthritis to spread through the bones." An overdose of the stuff mimics the symptoms of a nerve agent.
WASH: Creating just enough chaos so you can impersonate a real firefighter...
and get that armored car driver away from his truck, right?
ATHENA: Is that the guy?
SAM: I'm not sure.
(sighs) * Wimoweh...* Yeah.
That's him.
BUCK: So let's see if I got this right.
The fake nerve agent attack was a distraction for the armored car robbery...
which was a distraction for the diamond heist.
Crime is hard.
(chuckles) Franklin knew the bank and Marty knew us.
But how'd they know each other?
Brothers-in-law. Well, ex-brothers-in-law.
Franklin had been married to Marty's crazy sister.
And when they ran into each other again, a plan formed.
Franklin was the inside man.
His job was to create a medical emergency in the bank.
The kind that would trigger a hazmat response because Marty knew that we'd have to seal the perimeter to execute the Big Bird protocol.
The money's fine.
MARTY: You're in danger!
HEN: He gets the driver to leave the truck and empty all his pockets.
And while the driver gets clean, Marty gets rich.
Except, how's he gonna get all that money out of there?
Can't just walk it off the scene.
He needed a mule.
Or a team of mules. Us.
Not a bad plan. I mean, it's crazy, but it could've worked.
We bring the money back here and all he has to do is wait for the right moment, sneak in, access the ladder truck and retrieve the money. Except there wasn't any, because the police had already beaten him to the punch.
(song in foreign language playing) But how'd the police know exactly where to find the money?
'Cause there was one variable that Marty didn't count on.
The double-cross.
See, Marty may have known everything there is to know about LAFD protocol, but Franklin knew about the bank.
He knew what was in that vault.
He could steal those diamonds with his eyes closed.
See, Marty's plan was simple, but Franklin's was more time-sensitive, so he told Marty the best day to rob the armored car would be his last day.
He knew there'd be a party at the end of day, at the close of business.
He'd start with Marty's plan, then he'd improvise.
Franklin made sure he collapsed inside the vault.
He knew what our response would be.
911, what's your emergency?
CHIMNEY: Then all he had to do was wait for the vault to automatically close and time-seal for the night.
Then he'd have hours alone inside that vault while we ran our rescue protocols.
It was meticulous plan.
But there was an unexpected complication.
Me.
He was supposed to be in there alone.
So me running in to save his sorry ass? A complication.
He had to take me out, too.
* I've been caught stealing...* But now he's playing "beat the clock." Soon as the cameras couldn't see, Franklin swiped six million in stones and waited to be saved.
He had the stones.
All he needed was a clean getaway.
MAN: L. A. Department of Robbery and Homicide.
Yes, I have information on an armored car robbery.
HEN: He sends the police after us.
So, while the police are investigating us...
he could flee the country.
New name, new passport, new life.
He just wasn't fast enough.
Marty knew he'd been double-crossed.
He goes to confront Franklin.
Marty, l-look, I can explain it to you.
Where you going, Franklin?
Where's the money? Did you double-cross me?
Everything's gonna work...
no, I swear to you. I...
Did you double-cross me?!
No, I...(choking, grunting) So Marty killed Franklin.
What?
I didn't kill nobody.
What about the dead guard?
It was supposed to be non-lethal.
I mean, that's why we used it.
How was I supposed to know he was allergic?
But I never touched Franklin.
You have been charged with two counts of felony murder, grand theft, reckless endangerment and impersonating a firefighter.
You can make this easier on yourself.
Just tell us.
Where are the diamonds?
Diamonds?
What diamonds?
There are diamonds?
You believe him?
I don't know.
MERCER: He admitted to everything but killing Franklin and stealing the diamonds.
So where are they?
* Stomach contents include corn, some sort of grain -- possibly quinoa -- and some sort of foreign mass.
Appears to be...a diamond.
(stomach rumbles) (grunts) (laughter) BOBBY: Mm.
What are they putting on the death certificate?
Oh, my...
"Acute intestinal blockage." They rejected my suggestion.
"Cause of death: greed." (laughs) (knocking on door) Chief. This is a surprise.
Sorry to bother you at home.
Uh, it's okay.
Come on in.
Chief Alonzo, this is Athena Grant, my fiancée.
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
Uh, I should go.
I'd rather you stayed.
If that's okay with you, Chief.
There's no way to ease into this conversation.
Believe me, I tried to find one on the drive here.
LAPD has referred a matter to us for further review, based on some irregularities they found during their investigation.
The bank robbery investigation? I thought the team was cleared.
Team was. You weren't.
I think you know why.
You'll be on suspended duty pending a full inquiry.
We have a lot of questions.
Until they're answered to our satisfaction, you are relieved of your command, Captain Nash.
ATHENA: Just one minute, now.
You need to explain yourself.
For what reason are you relieving him of duty?
Captain Nash lied to us when he joined the LAFD.
About what?
About what happened in Minnesota.

Good.
You’re okay. I got you.
You’re okay. You're okay.
I got you.
West Coast, meet Midwest.
You’re okay.
Okay.
All right, buddy, you’re okay.
LAPD, I’m Sergeant Grant.
Got a call about a stabbing. Unknown assailant.
Well, actually, his name is Maurice.
Wha -- (gasps) Don’t worry, he's been disarmed. Go easy on him, Sergeant.
He’s had a rough day.
(stammering) Oh, no. No, no.
No, no. No, nope.
(clucking quietly) OSCAR: So, how’s the left coast treating you?
Um...it’s a different world.
OSCAR: (chuckles) I’ll bet.
You been making your meetings?
BOBBY: Hasn’t really been a problem.
No matter where you go, never hard to find a room full of old drunks and addicts.
90 meetings in 90 days, Bobby.
And you’ll keep looking for a local sponsor, right?
Yeah.
Take care of yourself, Bobby.
Will do.
(indistinct chatter) (cheering) ♪ (applause) (sighs) MAN: Thank you, Father.
Oh, sorry.
Did I keep you long?
That man has had a ridiculously busy month.
Uh, it’s all right. I just -- It’s been a while since I’ve done this.
Can we just talk here?
Please, sit down.
Oh.
Here’s something for your collection plate, Father.
Oh.
Would’ve been a year, but lastnight I reset the clock a bit.-Mm.
Did you have a bad day?
No, I had a good one.
FATHER JAMESON: Oh.
And you don’t get to have those?
I don’t deserve to have those.
I made a mistake.
And, Father, there aren’t enoughcandles in this church for the people that I hurt.
But I made a promise, and I’ve got a plan.
A way to make things right.
And until then, you don’t get to be happy?
I don’t get to forget.
And for a moment, I did.
Was doing good work with good people.
It felt familiar, like my life before.
(sighs)And I thought if I let myself...
I could go on living. Here.
Where’d you transplant from?
Minnesota. Took a job at the LAFD.
I basically ran away from one fire into another.
In my experience, there’s onlybeen one person who was good at multitasking from a cross.
He saved everybody from up there.
Now, if you want to help people, take this back...and earn it again.
Thanks so much, you guys. Thank you.
How are we looking?
Uh...
That good, huh?
Well, it’s worse than last month.
Which was...
Worse than the month before that.
Babe.
We’re gonna be okay. We’ll figure it out.
Okay.
Hey, why don’t you, uh, forget about the paperwork and just take Freddie home? I’ll lock up.
Are you sure?
What? You afraid I can’t keep upwith the dinner rush?
(chuckles) Point taken.
I’ll see you guys at home, okay?
Okay, honey.
Get your stuff together, we’re going home.
Wait.
Wait a minute, I just wantto finish this part, all right?
Hey.
Can I get you something else? Like...food?
Why would I want food?
Well, because you’re in a restaurant.
Yeah, no.
Look, man, you gotta buy something or you gotta leave.
Fine.
I’m taking my business elsewhere.
What business?
What business?!
(siren wailing) (horn honks) ELLIE: Why haven’t they come out yet?
Why didn’t the sprinklers come on?
We got two inside -- teenage boy and his dad.
Please. Please, my family’s in...
Stay back.
Ma’am, ma'am, we are on it.
Let’s get a hose line going. Kinard, you hit the roof.
You guys work containment from out here.
Please, please.
You have to save them!
Han, Wilson.
Don’t worry. I got 'em.
Cyanokits on standby. Deluca, you’re with...
Deluca, get back here.
Deluca, what are you doing?
DELUCA: My job. Saving lives.
BOBBY: Deluca, what’s your location?
Lots of smoke, too much vapor. Flashover conditions.
(filtered breathing) (exhales loudly) BOBBY: Marcy! Bobby!
(people screaming) (siren wailing) Marcy!
(indistinct voices) (siren wailing) (soft clinking) I got someone!
Sir, can you hear me?
(groans softly) Freddie.
(groans) (whimpering) I’m sorry. (coughs) Flashover.
(flames whooshing) (flames rumbling) CHIMNEY: Okay, there’s a skylight right above you.
Copy. I’m gonna vent the roof.
CHIMNEY: Copy that. Clearing the roof.
(debris clinking) (grunting) (flames whooshing) Paramedic!
Watch your back.
Where are you going?
There’s a kid in there.
(coughing) Cap! Hey, Cap! Sal’s got him!
Deluca, what the hell?!
Went out the back.
Seemed safer.
FREDDIE: Dad?
Dad. Mom, I’m sorry.
No. No, no.
I didn’t mean it. I didn't...
No, No. I-I know. I know.
I know.-I didn’t...I didn't mean to...
Thank you. Thank you so much.
FREDDIE: Is my dad okay?
SAL: Yes, he’ll be fine.
But we got to move him.
All right, let’s get you in here.
BOBBY: Hey. It’s gonna be okay.
I promise.
Found him hiding in the bathroom.
Smart kid. Probably saved his own life with that move.
Well, I’m glad somebody was thinking tonight.
(siren wailing) Deluca, I need a minute.
Now,Deluca!
You’re a piece of work. You come in here with your nose in the air and your eyes looking down.
Sal, stop.
You might want to watch your tone there, Deluca.
Why? ’Cause you're my captain?
You’re not.
You’re just the latest jackholein a long line of jackholes that come into this house and think they know how to run it.
And you think you know how to run it?
You put people’s lives at risk so that you could play hero.
That kid would be dead right nowif it wasn’t for me.
BOBBY: We could allbe dead right now becauseof you.
We just got lucky.
That wasn’t luck, man.
That was skill. The kind of skill it takes to save lives, to lead this house.
But definitely not the temperament.
Okay. Okay, enough.
Look, we get it, Fredo. You got passed over.
Now let it go and say you’re sorry.
You want me to apologize to this mook? Never gonna happen.
You are gonna learn to respect the chain of command, Deluca, or you’re not gonna work here anymore.
Screw you.
Yeah, I guess I got my answer.
You’re relieved of duty.
You’re firing me?
Pack your stuff, get out.
(indistinct, overlapping voices) (footsteps approaching) Did one of you polish the pipeson the engine, or do you delegate that to a probie?
That was...that was me.
Did it not meet your expectations, Captain?
No.
It exceeded them. Nice work.
Thank you.
So what’s with the book?
Sorry. I was just trying to make conversation.
Okay, Wilson, what do you want to talk about?
Hen. Everybody calls me "Hen." Not to be confused with "Han," who everybody around here calls "Chimney." Chimney? Why?
You should ask him.
And the guy you fired the otherday -- we used to call him "Sal." You think I was wrong to fire him.
He nearly got us killed.
But he didn’t.
Everybody lived.
Which is why I would have given him a second chance.
He didn’t want one, at least not from me.
Maybe he’ll have better luck at the 122.
You surprised?
You fired him.
Yeah, from this house.
Then I called Chief Alonzo, and I suggested a suspension and transfer would be best for everyone.
That’s...gracious.
I like to think of it as fair...which I do try to be.
Hopefully, you’ll learn that as you get to know me.
Listen, tomorrow night some of us are going out for drinks.
You should join us.
I don’t know.
Join us.
(bar patrons chattering, music playing) Look, man, Sal may have been a tool, but he was a useful one most of the time.
(chuckles) CHIMNEY: The punishment...
did not fit the crime.
He fired Sal to mark his territory.
Keep the rest of us in line.
HEN: Cap found a spot for him.
At the 122.
I mean, after six weeks of suspension for insubordination.
Seriously?
Cap’s plan was always just to reprimand him, but Sal...
Talked himself out of a job.
Well, at least that part tracks.
By the way, does anyone know what the hell a "mook" is?
(Hen laughs) BOBBY: It means a stupid person.
I googled it.
Didn’t expect to see you here, Cap.
Ah, Wilson -- uh, Hen -- invited me.
Oh, did she now?
What can I get for you?
BOBBY: Can I get a club soda, please?
(mouthing) And another round of whatever they’re having?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Drinks are on me tonight.
All right, make some room, come on.
Cap’s here, Cap's here.
TOMMY: I’m telling you, single is easier.
Having the scars impresses women, getting ’em freaks 'em out.
HEN: Well, listen, I still get decent mileage out of this one.
(men ooh-ing) (chuckles) That house fire, down in Venice, last year.
Factory explosion.
Caught a piece of shrapnel this big.
HEN: Ooh...
(Chimney inhales sharply) Ouch.
CHIMNEY: I don’t know.
I am thus far unscarred and I fully intend to remain that way.
Besides, I find this whole ritual a pale insult to the great Robert Shaw.
Mm.
(scoffs) (exhales) What about you, Cap?-All right.
Four-alarm blaze at an outlet mall, electrical burn from a live junction box.
(Chimney inhales sharply) Oof. (exhales) TOMMY: Oh, yeah.
Whoa.
Source of the fire, as it turned out.
"I don’t want to die without any scars." (laughs) Tyler Durden?
Fight Club.
Come on! (laughs) HEN (echoing): What?
(laughter) I’m sorry, guys. I have to call it a night.
I’m gonna make sure the waitress keeps the tab open for you, okay?
(slurring): Wha -- No.
♪ ♪ ATHENA: Step away. Hands in the air.
Sergeant Grant.
It’s just me, Captain Nash.
I know.
You still upset about the rooster?
What you doing here, Captain?
Just following a hunch, I guess.
You?
Same.
Laying in bed, trying to sleep and then I started thinking, "when it rains, it pours." But not in here.
See, sprinkler system never went off.
And the wife said it was serviced just last month.
Seems the water valve around back was shut off.
You have the same hunch?
No.
Mine was about the source of the fire.
Typically, these things are electrical.
But the breaker’s untouched.
Everything else is powered down.
I followed the burn patterns here.
And this is where I found the father.
Hmm, man runs into a building looking for his son and runs to the worst of it?
(wood clatters) Only how would he know where that is unless...
What do we got here?
What is left of a nine-volt battery.
And you see there? Steel wool.
Improvised incendiary timing device.
Probably set it before he left and didn’t expect his kid to come back.
Runs inside.
Doesn’t see his son.
Tries to put out the fire, but it’s too late.
This was arson.
Yeah.
Man sets his own place on fire.
I’m a hypocrite.
Bobby, I hate to break it to you, but I’m a sinner who wags his finger at other sinners.
So, welcome to hypocrisy.
I pulled this guy out of a fire.
Good man, good father.
Just in over his head.
So, he burned down his family business, for his family.
Mm.
Almost got ’em killed.
But somehow it’s me, the guy who didget his family killed, who has to hold him accountable, when I can’t even hold myself...
(exhales) I wouldn’t even have this job if Saint Paul hadn’t whitewashed my file.
Strings were pulled to get me this job, details were left out, and I allowed it to happen.
So did St. Paul.
And I mean the man, not the city.
He wasn’t always Paul, and he certainly wasn’t always a saint.
Saul.
Christ appeared to him in a blinding flash and embraced him with love and absolution and gave him a fresh purpose and a new name.
Now, L. A. is not exactly Damascus, Bobby, but it is where you find yourself.
Father, they whitewashed my file, not my application for sainthood. And I let ’em.
I don’t deserve it.
But that is the whole point of the story of St. Paul.
And of our faith.
Grace is not something that you earn or deserve.
It is a divine gift.
And I’m just supposed to accept that?
Yes. Yes.
(indistinct chatter) Thank you. Thank you.
(chuckles) ATHENA: Sir.
Can we talk?
Something wrong, Sergeant?
Anxious to get him home.
Sir?
Just give us a minute, El.
ELLIE: You know, why don’t we just bring the car around?
No, no, I want to stay with Dad.
It’s okay, buddy. Just go with Mom.
Come on.
Dad, what’s going on?
VICTOR: It’s okay. They...
they just want to talk to me about the fire.
FREDDIE: Okay, what do you need to talk about?
It was an accident.
No, it wasn’t.
Sir, you don’t have to...
Victor?
What did you do?
He didn’t doanything.
Yes, I did.
I set the fire.
Every month, we went deeper into the hole, and we were gonna lose everything.
I...I just thought a...
big check from the insurance company would give us another shot.
Sir, I’m gonna have to take youinto custody.
What were you thinking?
He was thinking of you. He was thinking of both of you.
My father is not a criminal. He’s not a criminal!
Freddie, it’s all right...
No, don’t you touch me!
You said everything was gonna beokay. You lied.
VICTOR: Freddie, stop, stop, okay? I have to go with them now.
I have to go.
FREDDIE: Dad...
I love you! I love you both!
Okay, enough, Freddie.-You’re supposed to save people.
Enough.
You’re supposed to save them!
BOBBY: He called me a liar.
And it stung.
Well, it sounds about right.
By your own admission, you’re a hypocritical liar who lies a lot.
(chuckles) All right. All right, you made a joke out of that.
(chuckling):Well, that’s because it's funny.
But it’s also true.
Your team. The other firefighters.
Do they know your past?
No.
I don’t want them to.
Mm.
They’re good people, good firefighters, and I ask everything of them.
To offer up all of themselves.
To trust that I can be in two places at once.
How’s that?
In front, to lead them.
And behind them, to always have their backs.
I ask for their trust, and I can’t give it back in return.
You don’t have to tell them what you’ve done in order to show them who you are.
Bobby, you may have a plan, and that’s all well and good.
But I have faith.
I have faith that God has a very different plan for you.

Always.
Well, when Bobby’s in the captain’s chair, anyway.

Hey, Cap. Why are you sitting uphere in your civvies?
And how come I am not smelling my breakfast? Heh.
Maybe you should all sit down.
Oh. This doesn’t feel good.
All right. I know the shift’s about to start, but I wanted to be here to tell you this in person.
As of this morning, pending further investigation, I am officially suspendedfrom my duties here at the 118.
What? Why? That-That’s insane.
Suspended for what?
For not disclosing what happened in Minnesota before I took the job.
Minnesota?
That’s old news.
Well, not to them, and if they knew all the details, there’s a very good chance they never would’ve hired me.
Cap, you don’t owe them that part of you.
You owe them your record.
All the people you’ve helped.
The lives you’ve saved.
Well, I knew the truth would catch up to me one day.
I just figured by the time it did, it wouldn’t matter.
I’d have nothing left to lose.
I was wrong.
WOMAN: Captain Nash, you understand that you are entitled to have a union representative or attorney present?
I do.
And you also understand that this is not a criminal proceeding?
I do.
MAN: Captain Nash, the duty of this panel is to make a recommendation as to whether or not you should remain a member ofthe Los Angeles Fire Department, and anything you say to us will be used in making this determination.
I understand.
I just want to tell the truth.

Seems to have had some kind ofexistential crisis after lunch.
Threw all his money off the roof and then decided to jump after it.
Falls 20 stories and lives.
20 stories? How is that even possible?
We also got a few greedybystanders with minor injuries.
Not sure how you want to handle those.
That's up to the cap.
BUCK: Uh, interimcap.
This is just temporary until Bobby comes back.
You keep telling yourself that, Buck.
(Barry groaning) Whoa.
All right, I'll take spinal precaution.
Right, I'm the captain.
Uh, Hen, Eddie, you're with him.
Buck, go with John. Triage the minor injuries.
And I'll get the Jaws.
HEN: All right, Barry.
I'm gonna give you something for the pain, okay?
It'll take the edge off, but you're probably still gonna feel this.
Can't you just knock me out?
Sorry, I need you to stay with me.
(Barry groans) Compound fracture, both legs.
(Barry grunts, shouts) (panting) Hasn't lost bowel control.
At least I got that going for me.
These are all positives, Barry.

Next time, I go headfirst.
You had all that money, though.
Why'd you throw it out the window?
That money ruined my life.
A year ago, I'd have thought it solved all my problems.
Just multiplied them.
Wait.
Wait, what-what happened last year?
I won the lottery.
Careful what you wish for.
(engine starts) (siren wailing) EDDIE: Oh, look at him.
Feel like I won the lottery.
Our son seems happy.
I swear, that kid was born happy.
I have no idea where he gets it.

Oh, you?
Hmm.
Mr. Broody?

Oh, nice. Good one.
(both chuckle) EDDIE: He loves having you around.
SHANNON: Does he?
We both do.
Eddie.
What are we doing?
What do you mean?
I need to know what you want.
I want this.
Want to have a nice day on the beach with my son and his mother.
Okay. So...is that what I am to you?
Christopher's mother?
(groans) Because, hey, if that's what it is, it's fine.
I just...I need to know.
Shannon...
I don't know.
I mean, these last months have been good.
Really good. I don't know.
Guess I'm just waiting for a sign.
Something...to know which way to step.
I think I might be pregnant.
(ringtone playing) Hi.
Good morning, Captain.
Good morning, Sergeant.
Checking up on me?
Mm, not at all.
I'm just jealous of your life of leisure.
(chuckles) Leisure?
You kidding me? I'm about to embark on a project so grand and so vast that I won't have a moment to even think about something as insignificant as possibly having my life's work taken away from me.
Oh, yes?
Yeah. I am gonna plan us a real wedding.
Obviously, I won't make any decisions without you.
Oh, no.
Feel free to pick out everything except the dress.
All I need on that day are just you and the kids.
All the other details? Have at it.
You know, if there's an upside to this suspension, it's that I get a chance to really concentrate on this.
Make the occasion worthy of the bride.
Oh!
Well, smooth-talk the investigating committee like that, there won't be a suspension for long.
Be safe out there, Sergeant.
I love you.
I love you, too.
(knock on door) Hey.
Hey. Am I bothering you?
Y-You would tell me if I'm bothering you, right?
No, you're not bothering me.
Okay, good. Um...when are you coming back?
Uh, I don't know, Buck. I-I might not be.
That's unacceptable.
We need to get you unsuspended.
Maybe I can talk to the chief, you know, testify on your behalf.
That-that would help, right?
Uh, you might get suspended, too. Let's...
We need you back, Bobby.
The place doesn't work without you.
So, we're doing lineups now?
Stow it, Buckley.
BOBBY: Buck, it's been two shifts. But I thought that having Chimney be in chargewould be easier on all of you. He's your friend.
Yeah, Chimney is my friend.
Interim Captain Han?
He's a monster.
CHIMNEY: Listen up.
Because the word of the day is "hose maintenance." Okay, I'm out.
BOBBY:  He's just being conscientious.
Conscientious? Or mad with power?
That's not the most efficient way to do it, guys.
Look, a week ago, Chimney was one of you.
Now he's responsible for all of you.
It's an adjustment for everybody.
Well, exactly how long will we be adjusting, Cap?
Because Responsible Chimney is freaking me out.
CHIMNEY: Get it nice and tight.
Clean line.
Watching, Buckley?
Yep.
HEN: It's not good.
(scoffs) He's not you, Cap.
You shouldn't expect him to be.
(exhales) You should tell him that.
This is shaking beef because you shake it.
Whoa. Uh...
Fire. Uh, fire.
Uh...
Chim, back up.
(Chimney coughs) BUCK: Smell that?
What's going on?
What's for dinner?
CHIMNEY: Okay, relax. There's plenty for everybody.
Maybe now would be a good time to reflect on our hose training. Hey, hey, hey!
The 118 eats dinner as a family, even if it is crappy pizza.
Sit down, Diaz.
Sorry, Cap. It won't happen again.
I just sat there.
I didn't know what to say.
Well, that's understandable.
You sure I'm not in your hair?
It's fine.
See, I don't know, Cap.
Another baby?
I mean, are we ready for that?
Were you ready the first time?
No. I...I knew I loved her, but I didn't think I was ready to get married.
If you two do decide to have another baby, you'll figure it out.
We already know you're a great dad.
I guess the question is, can I be a good husband?
That is a question.
Are you ready to ask it?
I don't know. It's just a stupid dance.
Probably shouldn't even go.
You like this girl.
So ask her out. See what happens.
What if she laughs at me?
What if she doesn't?
You don't think I was nervous when I asked your mother out?
You have a fire engine.
I do.
Well...I did.
They all hate me.
They don't hate you, Chim.
No, they do. This, like, a bad time?
It's fine.
You know, when the chief asked me to take over, I thought it would be fun, you know?
A couple of weeks of bossing everyone around.
Making Buck wash my car. What's not to love?
Except apparently everything.
Sometimes it's not easy being the boss.
Can I change my mind? Stop being their boss, go back to being their friend?
A good captain finds a way to do both.
(sighs) I don't think I'm up to it.
You can do this, Chim. You don't have to worry about being their friend. You already are.
You can do this because you know this team, you know what they're capable ofand they trust you.
Now you just have to trust themand yourself.
Don't push them. Lead them.

Only one each.
Our chocolate liquor -- teachers, it's N. A.-- is kept heated to 110 degrees.
First-time tasters say this is like nothing they've ever experienced before.
("I Like Candy" by Bow Wow Wow playing) That is good.
Yummy, right? Mm-hmm.
All right, now, if you'll throw your cups away and follow me to the packaging room.

(groans) ♪ Hey!♪
We tried pulling him out, but he was struggling so much that he sank even deeper.
Our chocolate is the richest in the country, but...unfortunately, that also makes it the heaviest.
Sir? Sir, how you feeling in there?
W-W-Warm.
CAROL: We had to leave the heat on.
My foreman was afraid if we didn't that the whole batch would just harden up.
Then we'd be chiseling him out.
All right, let's get to work!
The pressure on his body is probably slowing his circulation.
We don't get him out of here soon, he may lose consciousness.
CHIMNEY: All right, boys, let's pull him out.
EDDIE: Here, can you reach your hands above the surface?
No.
All right, we're gonna have to grab under his arms.
Okay, ready?
Pull on three.
One, two, three.
(strained grunting) (gasping, grunting) I got you, I got you. (strained grunt) What's happening here?
Physics. Physics is happening here.
You're creating a low-pressure pocket when you pull him up, and then that pocket is pulling him right back down.
Great. So basically chocolate quicksand.
Okay, everybody just stop for a second.
Hen, take out an O2 tank, rip off the mask, create an air tube.
It'll buy us some time if he goes completely under.
Time for what?
For me to think.
(grunting) Get him, get him, get him.
(panting) HEN: Here. Try to...try to bite this tube with your tongue so you don't lose it.
Okay, good. Okay, now what, Captain?
Did our cap just run away?
I think he went that way.
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(shouting) HEN: Breathe. Keep breathing, keep breathing.
CHIMNEY: Coming through!
HEN:Keep breathing, keep breathing,keep breathing now.
Keep breathing.
The hell?
It's cocoa butter. Tempers the chocolate, decreases the viscosity.
What? Stir.
(groaning loudly) Okay.
(grunting) Yeah. Keep-keep...keep mixing!
It's working! There we go!
(Hen grunts) Okay, here he comes.
More, more, more!
(grunting) (grunts) Keep mixing!
(chuckles) I lied.
I have no willpower.
I got lap-band surgery.
Quick thinking, Cap.
That was something.
You weren't so sure that I could do it, were you?
You called Bobby, didn't you?
I went down to the...I turned on the...he's a chef.
A good captain utilizes all his resources.
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles) It's not cheating.
Ma'am, I'm having trouble understanding you.
You need to slow down. What's the address again?
225 Pinecrest Lane. It's my brother.
He called me to say goodbye. You have to hurry.
Please send someone!
Police are already on their way. You said he called you.
When was that and where are you?
A few minutes ago. I didn't understand what he was saying at first. Damn it!
(horn honking) Turn already! Move!
I'm not gonna make it in time.  He's all alone, and I don't...
The officers will be there soon.
He won't be alone for long.
So let's focus on getting you home safe.
Take a deep breath.
Calm down.
(crying) (takes deep breath) What's your name?
Nicole.
Hi, Nicole. I'm Maddie.
We're gonna get you through this together.
What's your brother's name?
Sam. Foster.
Does Sam have any history of mental illness?
He's bipolar.
Bipolar 1.
Does he take medication for that?
He takes...I don't know. They switched his meds a few weeks ago. I can't remember.
That's okay.
Has Sam attempted suicide before?
More than once.
You said that he called you to say goodbye -- what did he say?
That he loved me.
That he was sorry, but he just couldn't do it anymore.
He was so tired.
You guys have been fighting like this for a while?
Since college.
But I thought...I thought the new meds were working.
(horn honking) He seemed better.
I wouldn't have left him if I...oh, God. I shouldn't have left him.
I shouldn't have gone out.
Nicole...this is not your fault.
Don't even think about that right now.
Just focus on helping Sam.
Right. I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
I know it's scary.
Has Sam ever been violent?
Not to other people.
Just himself.
And he seemed okay when you left the house?
Yeah. We had breakfast, and he said he was having a good day, and I believed him.
Wanted to believe him.
It's been so long since he felt okay, and I thought, for an hour, we could both just...
just breathe.
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm turning on my street.
Uh, y-you're at your house?
I'm pulling up. I see police cars.
Why are there so many?
(line beeping) (panting): N-Nicole?
Nicole?
Hey.
How's your day?
Unfinished. (wry chuckle) Are you saying that 'cause you're only halfway through a shift, or is something else going on?
You know that thing when you're in the thick of an emergency and you're helping someone, and then help arrives, and...
And they hang up on you.
Yeah, and you-you never get to know how it ends.
Don't you ever wonder?
All the time.
You can pull the reports, Maddie, but I don't recommend it.
If you don't read 'em, you can't know, and as long as you don't know...you can still hope.
For what?
Everyone lived.
Up here, I've never lost a call.
When I was a nurse, for every person there was abeginning, a middle and an end.
And you were there...for all of it.
You didn't just...hang up and then pass the responsibility to someone else.
That's the job.
Yeah, but if you're not there, if you don't know how the story ends, then how do you know if you're doing it right?
How do you know if you've made a difference?
You don't.
(sighs) That's why not everyone can do this.
Though I was pretty sure you could.
I didn't leave nursing.
I left Doug.
And this was a fallback plan, you know?
It was a safe place where I could just be a voice and not be seen.
But Doug is...he's gone now, and...I'm free.
To what?
What do you want to do?
(sighs) I wish I knew.
(takes deep breath) NED: Mm.
(both chuckle) Ah.
Peonies.
(chuckles) Like clockwork every year.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Mwah! Happy 25th.
Oh, I know. Right, huh?
I called Roberto, and he's giving us the table in front.
Oh. We're going to Roberto's?
We always go to Roberto's.
I'm sorry, honey.
Were you wishing that I'd pick someplace else?
Wishes are for suckers.
Come here.
(laughing) Mmm!
(doorbell rings) Oh. Well, you go get your keys, and I'll get the door.
Okay.
Oh, Ned.
I guess you can still surprise me after all.
(chuckles) (siren wailing, horn blowing) All right. Could I get that ETA?
Mail bomb. Wife's in rough shape, but she's still in one piece.
The house hasn't been cleared yet.
Bomb squad's still a couple of minutes out.
Copy that. Let's move!
NED: Here!
She's not breathing!
I tried talking to her, but she wouldn't answer.
BUCK: She can't hear you 'cause her eardrums are blown out.
All right, let's turn her.
On it.
Ready.
Eddie and I can handle this.
Breathing's shallow. We're looking at a bilateral pneumothorax.
We don't release the pressure, she could suffocate.
I did my share of these in combat.
Get some fentanyl, slow drip.
Chim, there's post-attack protocol.
You're the captain.
I'm also the most experienced paramedic on-site.
Four-inch catheter, ten-gauge.
All right, Buck and Eddie, there could be a secondary device.
We need to get everyone off the "X." Sir, is there anyone else in the house?
Uh...no, no. Is she gonna make it? Please, please, please tell me she's gonna make it.
Why don't you come with us?
We can check you out.
No, no, no, she has to know that-that we weren't just going out to dinner.
I had tickets for us to Fiji!
You can tell her...
You can tell her yourself later, I promise.
(grunts) HEN: Ma'am, can you hear me? You're going to feel a pinch, but it's gonna relieve the pressure.
(gasping) All right, tape her!
Sharp!
(gasping continues) (guttural groaning) (inhales sharply) (screaming) All right, tape her!
(crying): No!
Sharp!
Got it.
All right, let's move her!
(crying) Ready? Three, two, one.
I'm here, sweetheart.
I'm right here.
(echoing): I love you.
(door closes) (Shannon laughing) (speaking Spanish) We just had lunch with your...abuela.
ABUELA: Hola.
Hola.
SHANNON: And now, we're gonna get some...
Ice cream!
(laughs): Oh, ice cream?
Well, I do not envy you putting him to sleep tonight.
When I call you later to complain, just don't say "I told you so"?
(chuckles) All right, I promise.
I love you.
I love you.
(metallic scraping) Ooh! When's the wedding?
We're already married. Wait.
We don't have to get married again, do we?
Talk to Bobby.
Maybe he can get you guys a discount.
(chuckles) (sighs) Sue.
Sorry. I know that you're on your way out.
Oh, Don's picking me up.
Now matter how many watches I give that man, he's always late.
(chuckles) I am not gonna be able to take the extra shift on Friday.
I had something scheduled for the morning, but then they called, and they needed itin the afternoon, so...
That's okay. I'll get someone else to cover.
Have a good night.
It's a job interview.
I-I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be telling you that.
It just feels weird hiding it.
So you've decided, then?
You're leaving us.
Josh told me about the talk.
I spent...years not having a voice, and now that I do, it just feels like what I'm saying doesn't matter.
Oh, I think you underestimate yourself and your contribution here.
I appreciate that.
But, honestly, here, I'm just a person who sends help, and I need to get back to being the person who gives it.
EDDIE: Voilà.
SHANNON: Ooh, Eddie, I love these.
So is this some kind of Forrest Gump reference?
"Life is like a box of chocolates"?
Actually, uh, life is like a vat of molten chocolate.
Yeah, sometimes you...you fall into it, it drags you down, but it-it's...it's warm, you know?
It-It's...and it's...
It's sweet.
This is a very weird metaphor.
(sighs) When you came back into our lives, I was so glad.
And afraid.
(chuckles softly) I knew Christopher missed you, but I-I...I don't think I realized just...how much I did, too.
Eddie, uh, I think...
Oh, please, just let me say this.
We were so young the first time.
You know, young and not ready.
But we had this amazing kid.
Being his dad has been thesingle greatest joy of my life.
And that little boy has...tau...taught me more about being a man than war ever did.
You're a good dad.
You're a great dad.
Well, if I am it's because...he deserves it.
Yeah.
But he deserves his mommy, too.
He loves his mommy.
(chuckles) So do I.
♪ We could have done better♪ ♪ We could have tried harder♪
I want us to be a family again.
♪ We could have been stronger...♪ I wished for a sign.
(chuckles softly) ♪ We could have been so much more...♪
And I got one.
I'm not pregnant.
What?
I'm not...pregnant.
I...I was just late.
I freaked out, and then, I freaked you out, too, and I'm sorry.
That's got to be a relief, right?
It...it doesn't change a thing.
It does for me.
What?
I wrote this letter a few years ago right after I left, or, actually, after I...didn't come back...to Christopher...trying to explain why I couldn't be there.
And I figured that if, for some reason, I never found my way back, that he'd want answers.
And he needed to know that...it wasn't his fault.
That his mother didn't leave because she didn't love him.
She left because she did.
I never sent it, obviously.
And then, when I found out today that I wasn't pregnant, I took that letter out, I read it.
Eddie, I never want to have to send that letter.
Why would you ever?
Because if I try to do this again before I'm ready, there won't be a second chance.
(crying) I can't fail him again, or you, and I won't.
I'm still learning how to be someone's mother.
And after that, maybe I canlearn how to be someone's wife.
We're still married.
I think we should get a divorce.
Glad you came.
Yeah, I'm always down for coffee, but what's really going on?
Remember your first call?
Uh, anaphylactic shock -- seafood allergy.
You remember the first lesson I taught you on that call?
Yes, you taught me to listen.
Okay, terrific.
So, do that now.
Sue and I were on the phone for a long time last night trying to find a way to convince you of the difference you've made.
Look, I really appreciate that you and Sue were talking...
I never said that Sue and I were talking to each other.
NICOLE: "We're gonna get through this together." Nicole?
Yeah.
Wait.
Is-is Sam...?
He's okay.
Oh.
The police got there in time, and I got home in one piece.
Because of you.
Hearing your voice -- it...it kept me focused, gave me hope.
Your voice saved my life.
Even though I didn't hear it.
I was unconscious, in labor.
The earthquake had just hit, and I...I was dying.
We both were.
(baby cooing) I didn't know what to do. You said help wasn't coming.
It should have been terrifying, but your voice was so calm and reassuring.
And you-you got us help in a way I never could have expected.
Same here.
Because of you, I made it home for Christmas.
Just because you said I would.
Brandon.
Seattle.
My emergency was I was an overworked idiot, but you made sure they found me.
You saved my life.
Hey, you saved our marriage.
I was on the edge.
Literally on the edge, justlost, and then I saw my Norman.
And it's because you found a way to get him to me.
You helped us find our way backto each other.
You did.
GLORIA: I probably would have hung up on you.
I'm just being honest.
Maddie has more patience than I ever did.
Gloria.
I thought that you were...
Took a plea,and since we skipped the trial, I never got a chance to see you again to tell you...I was wrong.
About hanging up on people?
About the dead-end calls, the people that couldn't be saved.
I always thought there was nothing I could do for them, but there was.
I could've listened, just been there for them at the end so they didn't have to be alone.
But is that enough?
I mean, I'm there for them in the beginning, I'm there for them...in the middle, but it still doesn't seem like it's enough to make a difference.
It's not...until it's your emergency.
And then you...you realize that the middle is the scariest part, because you don't just need help.
You need hope.
(chairs scraping) And that's what your voice is, Maddie.
It's hope.
Thank you.
(exhales) All right, make way! LAFD!
All right, John, triage the minor injuries.
Hen, you're with me.
Buck and Eddie, check the driver.
Ma'am, can you hear me?
I, um...
I tried to stop, but I didn't see any of them.
Are they okay?
Yeah, we're taking care of the others, ma'am.
Right now, we need to see if you're okay.
Um, m-my neck hurts. Oh, God.
Okay, ma'am, we're gonna put this on you as a precaution until the doctors at the hospital can check you out.
Th-There was a lady. Is-is she all right?
EDDIE: Buck? What's going on?
BUCK: Eddie.

Eddie, wait. Eddie...
Eddie, let me handle this.
How bad is it?
It's bad.
Spinal injury?
Maybe worse.

Got it?
I'm riding with her.

Hen, stop.
Do not intubate.
Not yet.

I know.
He knows.
Get in there and say goodbye to your wife.

Or maybe not.
You're so young.
Maybe you've already adapted to a world without me.
I hope for that and fear it at the same time.

But I'm starting to think that I'm not one of those things.
At least, not right now.

I guess I have my answer.
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm not the one with the dead wife.
Or any wife.
Which is probably good, because...I was pretty cool with letting Eddie's just die.
Is that what you think happened?
I think I withheld medical carefor a patient and she died.
Chim, she was dead when we got there, okay?
Just took a few minutes for her brain to catch up with her body.
You know, I keep going it over and over again in my head.

How would Bobby have...
Bobby is not the captain right now, Chim.
You are.

You've been a nightmare.

I mean, as your friend, I want to see you succeed, but...
You didn't think I could do it.
Hell no.
I knew you could do it.
My fear was, once you realized you could do it, life as a paramedic, as my partner...
wouldn't be good enough.
(sniffles) (chuckles softly) (sniffles) I miss it, you know.
Being in the ambulance with you.
Kicking ass. Saving lives.
I feel like everything's changing.
Not this.
You might not be my partner now, but you're still my best friend, Chim.
And that's never gonna change.

I thought it'd be a good distraction, but, um...
Yeah, it feels wrong.
Yeah.

Seeing him in the hospital, it just took me right back.
Okay.
Let's just go home.
Yeah. Thanks.

Authorities are urging the public to be on high alert tonight.
Everything okay?
The suspicious package was left on the doorstep of a home in Westwood sometime in the afternoon.

That's not the scene that you were called to the other day.
No, no, no. A new one.
A retiree attempted to open it.

The second victim, a retired insurance adjustor, is clinging to life at this very hour.
Now, authorities are urging the public: stay vigilant.
If you see something, say something.
If the truck's parked ina driveway with its hazards on, it's probably just making a delivery.
No, sir. Having a foreign-sounding last name is not reason enough for me to send the police out to investigate your neighbors.

Hey, hey, who you calling stupid?
You're dumb. The car is stupid.
This whole production, actually.
(ignition sputtering) Will you quit your complaining?
You wanted me to retire. Fine.
But first...
I'm gonna give 'em a show.
Right now, I'm looking ata useless heap of rusted junk...
and then there's the car.
Har-har.
Me and this car got a lot of miles left on us.
Baby.
This is dangerous.
You might be my fourth wife, but Janis here, she's my first love.
I think you just want to go outin a big old blaze of glory.
Yeah? Well, if it means I'd get one single minute of peace and quiet...
Hey!
...so be it.
(Roy chuckles, clears throat) Try her now.
Try her now!
Okay!
(engine starts) (screaming) Roy!
(continues screaming) Roy!
(sirens wailing) ROY: Be careful what you do, okay?
I know, I know.
Do you know what y...
Just be quiet. Be quiet!
Where you going? Where you...
Ma'am, what happened?
He got himself all caught up in the engine -- it just,it just sucked him straight in.
"She," damn it! The car is a she!
Let this be a lesson to you, Roy.
You mistreat a woman, they mistreat you right back.
You know, I-I've been trying to,like, cut him loose, but I can't quite get in there.
Let's get down there and see what we can do.
HEN: Oh.
Sir, I need you to keep very, very still.
Any chance you can get me loosewithout cutting the hair?
It's kind of my trademark, you know?
MAUDE: Forget the hair!
You've been scalped.
What?!
MAUDE: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
You know, this isn't even the worst he's been hurt.
Okay, ma'am, I need you to giveus some room to work, okay?
What? Why?
Yeah, I can see why she couldn't get in there.
His hair is too tightly wound into the belt.
We can't cut him free without pulling at the wound and making it worse.
We'll have to come at it sideways.
Sideways? What do you mean, sideways?
EDDIE: We're gonna have to cut the engine belt and remove the alternator, probably the crankshaft pulley, whatever's in the way to get you free.
Like hell you are!
(power tool whirring) We need to locate that piston.
ROY: That hood's a one-of-a-kind.
Just be careful. Please.
We'll need a socket wrench for that crankshaft.
ROY: Oh, man.
Ooh.
ROY: Oh, don't put that over there.
Oh, God.
One, two...
(Roy screams) CHIMNEY: Just hold on.
Almost there.
(Roy groans) You're killing her!
Try to relax, sir.
ROY: How can I relax?
You're killing my car, man.
ROY: Oh, man.
Thought you wanted a blaze of glory.
Setting you on fire, now that would be a glorious blaze.
(screaming) Please, sir, do not move! Do not move!
Damn it. He pulled the occipital vein.
Cap, he's gonna bleed out.
All right, let's step it up, guys.
Hen, what's going on down here?-I'm almost there.
MAUDE: Oh, God, don't let him die, you guys.
I love the bastard.
HEN: Almost there.
Maude, I swear to you, honey, if I get out of this alive, I'll never do a reckless thing ever.
I'm done with that life. (crying) MAUDE: It's okay, baby, we're gonna get you out.
HEN: It's coming, coming, coming.
MAUDE: I'm here, baby.
CHIMNEY: Got it.
Let's raise him up, nice and easy.
MAUDE: Oh!
(Roy groans) MAUDE: You dumb fool.
All this just to impress a couple dozen people?
Not them.
You.
All you got to do to impress me is live.
He'll live.
I will?
(Maude exhales) You hear that, Maude?
I'm gonna live.
Keep the parts safe, honey.

And the view. (laughs) You cannot put a price on that.
Yeah, but, mm, you did.
(laughs) There's wiggle room.
Well, we are all about the wiggle room, right?
(chuckles) Yeah.
I like it.
Open floor plan.
Touch of modern.
A little raw.
I see the potential.
Do you, now? (chuckles) Yeah.
We could, uh, we could have youliving like a real adult.
BUCK: Oh.
ALI: Yeah.
(chuckles) This would be my first place all on my own.
Oh. I assumed you'd be living here together.
Oh, uh, no.
(chuckles) No, this is...She's just my decorator.
(laughs): Uh, no. We, uh...
We're just not quite at that stage yet.
ALI: Yeah, not quite.
We're at the stage where I'm ready for his man cave to get a little more natural light.
I travel a lot for work, and he's...
Better than a hotel.
ALI: Oh, yeah. A lot better.

♪ Hey, guys, it's Becca.
I'm back from Belize, and I am super pumped to tell you all about my trip and the amazing new products I tried.
So, thanks to my partnership with Pouty Gal Lip Wear, we got to tour all over.
The Belizeans are so adore, and, like, even though they don't have a lot of money or whatever, they're still, like, super happy to serve you and always smiling, and I just love them.
I mean, I'm, like, totally reeling from all that travel, but, you know, that's the life I chose.
Like, putting myself out there to find you guys next-level products to make you look and feel beautiful, even when I don't.
'Cause you see this?
Oh. Oh, gosh. This is so gross, you guys.
Okay, well, um, it happens.
You know, this is real life, and I'm always gonna keep it 100with you guys, which is why today I will be showing you the proper way to pop a pimple.
What you want to do...
is start away from the whitehead and just gently apply pressure to the surrounding area.

Oh, God, you guys.
Oh, this is the worst zit ever.
Ow. (inhales sharply) (groaning) Oh, ow.

Guys?
Yeah.
I can feel it, but I can't move it.
Like, really hurts on my shoulder.
HEN:Looks like a fractured clavicle.
CHIMNEY: We're gonna sit you up.
HEN: Okay.
There we go.
Ow.
Uh, dispatch said something about an animal?
Yeah, it, um, came out of my face.
What are we looking for, exactly?
It was like a little, little worm.
Or like a grub, maybe.
Like a maggot?
Oh, don't say "maggot." Maggot.
You been out of the country lately?
Uh, yeah, I actually do a lot of traveling for work.
What do you do?
Uh, I'm a beauty and fashion influencer.
HEN: Has your circle of influence included Central and South America?
BECCA: No. No.
I mean, I did just get back from Belize.
Belize is in Central America.
Oh. Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Botfly.
Parasite indigenous to Central and South America, including Belize. They reproduceby trapping mosquitoes and laying their eggs on them.
And then when the mosquito lands on you, the egg hatches and crawls right into the feeding site.
BUCK: Luckily it looks like you got it out all in one piece.
They'll be able to extract the rest at the hospital.
The rest?-Think of them as new followers.
(chuckles) Gross!
Let's get you up. (grunts) Ow.
Oh, my God, wait.
No, no, no, no, can somebody grab my phone?
No, go back. Hand me my phone.
Wait, you guys. (groans) Hi, guys. Later.

He didn't, like, get into MIT.
Hey, it's an engineering project.

Harry! Don't move!
Contact the bomb squad.
(horn honks) You guys okay?
Yeah, we're fine.
(exhales) Oh.
Oh. Oh, thank God you were here.
You know, something just looked wrong, you know?
BOYD: Sergeant Grant.
ATHENA: Yeah.
Shawn Boyd. ATF. I'm running point on the serial bomber task force.
ATHENA: So it's confirmed?
I'm on this guy's mailing list?
We think so.
Gold foil seems to be consistentwith the other three bombings.
Three?-We found another this morning.
Vernon Clemmons.
L. A. Superior Court judge. You know him?
ATHENA: I've been in his courtroom more than once.
Is he okay?
Pronounced dead on the scene.
Are you gonna take it with you?-We're gonna try.
Could be some valuable evidenceinside that box.
Every package has gone off as soon as someone...moves it.
That was it?
(indistinct radio chatter) Oh, give me a second. Thank you, Officer.
Yeah. Hey, I got here as fast as I could.
They wouldn't let me down the street.
Oh. Do they have any idea who's doing this?
Yeah, well, I keep running it in my head.
I was at the first bombing, butthe woman doesn't look familiar.
Not her name or her face.
They say she's a defense lawyer.
We must've crossed paths, but I-I just...
You've been doing this for a while.
You're not gonna remember everyattorney you've ever met.
They also showed me a photo of the insurance adjuster.
He didn't look familiar, but the only one that I am sure of is Judge Clemmons.
Clemmons? Why does that sound familiar?
Sergeant Grant.
Do you remember working an arsoncase about three years back?
It was a restaurant.
Guillermo's.
I, um -- Agent Boyd, this is Captain Nash of LAFD.
We worked on that case together.
It's the only time I've had to testify since I moved to L. A.
The owner was Victor Costas.
He got six years. Should still be in prison.
Well, released early, on account of he's dead.
About three months ago. Cancer.
He had a wife and a kid. A teenager.
And the son, his son, was really angry when his father got arrested.
Father's dead.
I wonder how angry he is now.
I can't help you. I don't know where Freddie is.
I haven't seen him since Victor's funeral.
Yeah, I heard about your husband's death.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Are you?
You put him in there.
Now you want to put Freddie away, too.
He's hurt a lot of people, Mrs. Costas.
Killed a judge.
I don't know anything about that.
ROMERO: Maybe. At first.
Mrs. Filson defends criminals. Probably had a lot of enemies.
Then the insurance adjuster, who's on life support, by the way, you told yourself what?
It was a coincidence? Couldn't be true?
We lost everything.
Insurance wouldn't pay.
All our creditors sued us.
We sold everything we had to pay for that lawyer, and what did we get?
A death sentence.
Prison brokemy husband, and then it killed him.
So Freddie was angry.
At the lawyer, at the judge, at the insurance company.
Who else is he angry at, Mrs. Costas?
Bomb squad just cleared your home, Captain Nash.
Nothing there.
Well, I guess that's a relief.
It doesn't make sense, though.
I was there the day his father was arrested.
He said you blew up their lives.
Maybe he's saving Captain Nash for last.
Hasn't sent the bomb yet.
Or maybe you searched the wrong house.
(alarm ringing) (excited chatter) (siren wailing) (horn blowing) DISPATCH: 118, 118, this is Dispatch.
Got Bobby Nash on the line. He says it's important.
Wait, what? Dispatch?
Dispatch, please repeat.
(car alarm blaring) Ow. Oh!
(grunting) (gasping) You're new.
DWIGHT: If you're just joining us, witnesses are reporting that this LAFD ladder truck, belonging to station house 118, was hit by some kind of an explosive as it was making its way to a call.
Now, you can see there's a firefighter pinned under that truck...
MADDIE: Looks like a crush injury.
Those can be tricky.
Hypovolemic shock. Hyperkalemia.
(crying): He's all alone.
JOSH: He's not.
He's surrounded by people who want to help him.
Then how come no one's running in there?
They can't. You know that.
We've got a perimeter set up, but we're just guessing the blast radius on that thing.
Can't toss him a phone. We're not sure what kind of signal he's operating on.
CHIMNEY: Dispatch, this is Captain 118. What is theplay? I've got people dying in the street.
Hold your position, 118.
FREDDIE: Get me the captain!
Where's the captain?!
Hey, I told you not to move.
Cap-Cap...
Cap!
I'm the captain, okay?
I'm the captain, so please justlet me help them, okay? Please.
No. No, I don't want you.
I want Captain Nash.
I love you.
Captain Nash! Don't confront him!
He wants me.
He wants you dead!
Let's give him what he wants.
Captain Nash!
Shoot me if you have to.
DWIGHT: This is unexpected. A civilian now confronting the young man with that vest.
We've got no details on this man's identity.
Freddie!
Thought you'd be on the truck.
I'm here now.
(phone vibrating) How far away are you?
What's next?
It's what you wanted.
Wanted you dead.
I get that.
But what about them?
What about him?
(groaning) He's got parents, a sister, a girlfriend, and he never did anything to you.
He wasn't even a firefighter when your father burned down that restaurant.
Collateral damage.
Is that how you see yourself?
An unintended victim in all this?
Stop.
One more step, we all go boom.
Freddie, you got dealt a badhand, and I am sorry about that.
But what you did with it -- that's a choice.
You stopped being a victim themoment you left that first bomb.
That lawyer! She...
Did her job.
We were all doing our jobs.
Destroying my family.
My mom and I lost everything.
She was in so much pain.
Want to make it worse? You wantto make her watch you die?
Freddie.
Mom.
No, no, no!
(both grunting) Freeze! Freeze!
Don't move!
Dead-man's trigger.

I need all hands on deck to move this truck and clear a path to the nearest trauma center.
How's he doing, Chimney?
We're out of time, Cap.
All right, let's try to lift this off him, yeah?
Try to lift this off him!
BOBBY: Okay, okay, we got to try to lift this!
DWIGHT: Well, that firefighter really appears to have taken the brunt of all of this.
That's an entire ladder truck that you see there.
We can only hope for the best at this point.
Get a hand on.
Come in! Come in! Come in!
BOBBY: Get some hands in here. Let's lift this.

HEN: Lift a little higher!

No. We need more people.

Okay, okay, okay, Buckaroo. All right, all right.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
Is it? Did you speak to the doctor?
Did he say anything about how the surgery went?
Just that you made it through.
And you're now the proud owner of one titanium rod and four beautifully cobalt-chromed screws. (chuckles) You were hoping for something more?
Before they wheeled me in, he, uh...
he said he didn't know how it was gonna go.
You'll walk again.
Yeah. He-he said...
he said he was pretty confidentabout that.
He, uh, he just -- he didn't knowif I would ever...
work again.
Okay, I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you that it's gonna be all right.
But I don't think you need to beborrowing trouble, not yet.
Let's just take this moment and be glad that you're alive.
Ali seems nice.
You met Ali?
Mm.
So we're into brunettes now.
She was actually blonde when I met her.
Oh, so we're just gonna cover the waterfront.
Carla...
(both laughing) ALI: He's awake.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey...
Hey.
You were in surgery for a while.
Too long.
Thank you for being here.
I would like it noted that he didn't thank either of us.
Girl, I don't think he knows we're still in the room.
Right?
(Carla laughs) KAREN: It's Caltech, part-time.
So it'd be half the moneybut twice as many hours at home.
HEN (chuckles): Remember when working remotely wasn't even a thing?
KAREN (laughs): Like it was yesterday.
I guess in the grand scheme of time, it was yesterday.
If only you could do that.
(laughs) Bite your tongue.
The day I'm working from home, our damn house is on fire.
(laughs) I figure it'll be good to have more time with Denny...
and anyone else who might come along.
You see what you did there?
(laughs) Just dropped it, quiet-like.
Well, I've been thinking.
I am a woman of a certain age...
HEN:Well, if there's anybody who canstrong-arm Mother Nature, it's you.
Are you serious about this?
(sighs) It's not like we never talked about it.
We had a whole plan and then...
HEN: Denny.
KAREN: We weren't sure if we were making the right decision that time either.
But there has never been a day I regret choosing being his mom.
Do you?
You and that man are the two things that get me home every day.
A couple more footsteps stompingaround the house might be nice.

Chim, for real?
I'm kidding. We own it.
With the caveat that we are not allowed to flip, crash, or blow her up any time soon.
Oh.
But I made no promises.
Cap.
You're back.
I'm back.
Well, it's kind of hard to fire a guy who was a hero on the 6:00 news.
Imagine the letters they would get.
HEN: Not to mention the fiery tweet-storm that'd rain down on their heads,starting with me.
Welcome back, Cap.
(laughs) About damn time.
Thank you.
Feels great to be home.
But admit it, you do miss Captain Han just a little.
Not even a little.
Things are finally getting back to the way they should be.
Almost.
Easy, okay?
I don't want you to fall and break the other one.
I am just glad to be out of the hospital.
Yeah?
I miss my own bed...
which I won't see for the next three months.
Guess I am sleeping down here.
You're like a perpetual roommate.
Even in your own place.
Lesson learned: Never sign a lease if you intend on being crushed by municipal equipment.
Mm. Uh, or better idea?
(Buck grunting) How about not get crushed by municipal equipment?
Huh. Now, why didn't I think of that?
I don't know. Mm.
So...
have you, uh, have you thought about what's next?
Once you take this thing off. (laughs) Why? Did-did the doctor say something to you?
No.
Um, I don't -- I don't know, you know.
I guess a lot of physical therapy and then...
You'll probably want to just get right back out there.
Yeah, of-of course, I mean...
You know, wh-what else?
Uh...
What? Come on, what's going on?
I watched you almost die, Evan.
Yeah, but I didn't.
But you could have.
But I didn't.
I know. I...
I know. Thank God.
Look, I...It's not like I didn't know you were in a dangerous line of work when I met you, you know, ten stories up of a collapsing high rise.
Exactly.
That was one day...
one day of my life, Evan.
It's every day for you.
I'm just starting to really understand what that means.
Wait, so-so you want me to quit my job, that's what you're asking me to do?
No, I would never -- I would never ask you to do that.
Listen.
I know it's who you are.
I'm just not sure...
If it's who you are.
Hey.
I don't know yet.
Okay?
Hi.
Hi.
Right. What am I doing here?
Um...
I asked you if things were ever gonna be the same and you said no.
You know, I've been thinking about that a lot, too.
And, uh, I think maybe I was wrong.
I think you were right.
But that's okay because...
We're never gonna get back what we would have had.
But maybe we could have something else.

We're just gonna tuck it in the top of your cast.
I don't even know why I'm taking you.
You shouldn't be on your feet; you need to be healing.
Well, this is more important.
If I break anything else, they can just fix that, too, with the other stuff.
Wait. What other stuff?
They want me to have another surgery.
Uh, doctor wasn't happywith what he saw on the X-rays, so he wants to go back in and replace the rod and do some bone grafts.
Well, do they think it's a delayed union or nonunion?
I mean, if it's just healing slower than expected, you could just wait a few weeks.
I'm not waiting.
The sooner I have the surgery, sooner I can go back to work.
So the doctor does want you to wait.
You should listen to him.
Okay. We're talking about your health.
Your ability to walk.
We're talking about the rest of your life.
No, being a firefighter is my life.
It is the, the only thing I haveever done that was important and that mattered, okay?
Without that, I-I-I don't have...
You will still be Buck, okay, and we will all love you.
There are lots of other important things that you can do with your life.
No.
No, I've already made my choice.

I'm not so sure.
Sometimes I think this life chooses us.

He passed me about three miles back.
DISPATCHER: Is the suspect male?
The suspect was a blur.
DISPATCHER: Could you tell if there was anyone else in the vehicle?
ATHENA: The only way we're gonna see who's in that car is if we get a whole lot closer.
(dramatic music) I'm sorry, did you say you're in the car that the police are chasing?
Yeah, I'm the driver. The police are chasing me!
(tires screech) What's your name?
TONY: It's Tony. Tony Bryson.
Okay, Tony, I'm Maddie. Can you tell me what's going on and why you won't pull over for the police?
Because I can't! The gear shifter thing broke and now, it just keeps speeding up.
I can't stop the car. Please help!
(sirens wail) (dramatic music) You think the kid's telling the truth?
I think children, as a rule, are pathological liars.
So who knows?
But this one seems pretty scared.
ATHENA: 15 years old, he probably doesn't even have his learner's permit.
(horn honking) All right, send me every unit you can spare.
We're gonna need to shut down this freeway.
* MADDIE: Tony, what's your speed right now?
100, 105.
And your foot isn't on the gas pedal?
No, I'm not touching it at all.
It's like the car's possessed.
It's like I knew I wasn't supposed to be driving it and it's punishing me.
Okay, and you've tried using the brake?
TONY: It didn't work. The car wouldn't stop.
It started shaking real, real bad.
I thought I was gonna crash.
There's no way that you can shift the car into neutral?
TONY: I'm trying. I can't get it into gear.
Please help me. I can't hurt the car.
MADDIE: Hey, the car is not important right now.
Only you are.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
My dad will kill me if anything happens to this car.
MADDIE: Okay, I don't think that's true.
TONY: No, he loves it more than anything.
More than me. Like, no one's supposed to drive it.
He doesn't even drive it.
He just sits in it listening to Phil Collins.
Okay, Tony, I'm sure that your father -- You have to find another way!
ATHENA: I think he's getting tired.
We may have even less time than we thought.
Isn't there any other way to stop him?
ATHENA: He's going too fast for a PIT maneuver.
We could try spike strips, but if those tires don't hit just right, he could lose control.
Flip the car.
The convertible.
Um, maybe if he aimed for the strips?
ATHENA: An inexperienced driver in a car doing triple digits?
There's no way he could hit a target that small.
(dramatic music) But he could probably hit something bigger.
BOBBY: Kid's car is moving like a runaway freight train, but they got a plan to slow him down before he crashes.
So we're on cleanup duty?
Not exactly.
Are you insane?
That car is a 1970 Ferrari Daytona Spider!
And if he so much as puts a scratch on it, I swear to God, I -- Tony is already more afraid of hurting that car than he is of hurting himself.
Partially because he is 15, but mostly because he thinks you love that car more than him.
Of course I -- he doesn't -- he didn't actually say that, did he?
MADDIE: Yes, he did.
Now, please, I need you to talk to him and tell him he's wrong, and I need him to believe it.
(somber music) Okay.
MADDIE: We got a cruiser coming to you now.
(siren whoops) He's here, he's here.
* TONY: Maddie, you still there?
Maddie, what's going on? Where are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here.
TONY: The police are slowing down.
Why? What's happening?
Tony, can you hear me?
TONY: Dad?
Oh, God, Dad, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I really screwed up.
No, no, it --it --it -- it's fine, son.
TONY: You're not mad?
CHARLES: Of course not.
It could happen to anybody, right?
Why aren't you mad? You love this car.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do love the car.
I mean, it is a one-of-a-kind car, Tony.
But I mean, you're a one-of-a-kind kid, too, right?
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!
What?
TONY: That's why you're doing this.
You're just pretending not to be mad.
I told you I'm not mad!
No, you're totally mad!
I know it! You're just not yelling at me because you don't want our last words to be -- That is not -- I just took the car to show my friends.
Like, they didn't believe that some stick in the mud could have such a cool car -- Stick in the mud?
TONY: It was just supposed to be fun and now, I'm --I'm gonna die.
You're not gonna die, okay?
I may wring your neck once I know you're safe.
So please, just shut up and listen to me for a second, all right?
The car doesn't matter, okay?
None of it matters, Tony.
All that matters is that you get out of there in one piece.
That's all that I care about.
Maddie says she has a way to stop the car.
I need you need to listen to her and then do exactly what she says, okay?
Okay. What do I do?
Okay, there's an exit coming up.
BOBBY: They're clearing a stretch of Woodley Avenue.
We'll meet them there.
How fast is he going?
105.
Once he gets to Woodley Avenue, he'll hit the brakes, hope he slows down a little.
And that's where we come in.
That's a vintage car.
You worried about damaging a classic, Chim?
I'm worried about damaging a kid.
Airbags weren't standard until the '80s.
A car that old, we're lucky it has a shoulder harness.
But if they can get it down to 60 or 70...
I like his chances better.
What kind of crazy person came up with this plan?
My wife.
(Phil Collins' "In The Air Tonight" plays) * WOMAN: I see him. He's taking the exit.
(tires screech) Kid's on the move.
Is everyone in position?
WOMAN: Bobby, are you ready?
BOBBY: I'm getting in position on Woodley Avenue.
COLLINS: * Oh, Lord WOMAN: All right, Maddie, we're ready.
Let's do this.
Are you ready, Tony?
Yeah, hitting the breaks now.
Remember, constant pressure. Don't pump them.
Slowing down.
It's shaking again. I don't like this.
No, no, no, that's okay. That's okay, it's gonna shake.
Just stay on the brakes.
Keep the wheel straight.
What's your speed?
95, 90, 85.
80.
It's not going any lower.
Oh, my God, there's a fire truck!
What do I do? Do I go around it?
MADDIE: Keep going straight.
Stay right behind the truck.
Do you know where the emergency brake is?
Uh, yeah.
(tires screech) Oh, the truck's slowing down. It's getting real close.
Good, now pull the parking brake and hit that truck.
What?
Hit the truck!
* COLLINS: * I can feel it coming * In the air tonight * Oh, Lord * But I've been waiting for this moment *
* For all my life (sirens wailing) * Oh, Lord * I can feel it in the air tonight * Help, hey, help!
COLLINS: * Oh, Lord * Oh, Lord * But I've been waiting for this moment *
* For all my life We got him, Cap.
 * Oh, Lord * I can feel it (dramatic music) Getting the dry chem, Cap!
Tony!
(indistinct), Dad.
Is he okay?
HEN: Broken nose, a possible concussion.
Or he hit the steering wheel.
Was it just your head or your chest too?
Head.
(gas hissing) I'm not seeing any signs of chest trauma.
They'll do scans at the hospital just in case.
CHARLES: Buddy, it's gonna be okay.
They're gonna take you to the hospital.
You'll be all right, okay?
I'm sorry, Dad.
It's all right.
CHARLES: It's just a car.
(air hissing) (soft music) * There'll be an investigation to determine what caused the car to malfunction.
I'd call it a loose clutch.
Looks like the gear shift broke clean off under the boot.
Throttle must have gotten stuck wide open from the linkage break.
Wait, how's the car? Can it be fixed?
Here, something to remember it by.
You know, I heard there's a Testerossa coming up for auction soon.
What do you say we get that instead?
Does it have airbags?
(laughs) (stirring music) Kids today.
* (dramatic music) * BUCK: Martinez!
(air hisses) I got them.
* I got her. Headed down.
* (heavy breathing) Baby doll factory, new record.
Most guys take the stairs. Welcome back, Buckley.
(Redbone's "Come and Get Your Love" plays) *
* Hey We're not late, are we?
(chuckles) The guest of honor hasn't arrived yet.
I'd hate to miss an opportunity to cry.
Yeah.
ATHENA: Are the IVF shots taking their toll?
KAREN: I feel like a human pin cushion.
A very weepy pin cushion.
(laughter) So first official party at the Grant-Nash household.
Oh.
I didn't think it was gonna really happen.
Or that any of us would be invited.
See, here you go again.
I told you don't take it personally.
Then don't take it personally that I ain't getting you guys no gift.
And they're almost here.
And we are almost ready.
Sorry, Bobby, no sign of any other platters.
I saw your mom put some stuff in the shed.
Maybe check in there.
They're here, they're here.
Come on in, he's here.
* (doorbell rings) (indistinct chatter) * all: Surprise!
Aw!
Did you do this?
Yeah.
SINGERS: * Come and get your love *
* Come and get your love (laughter) * Come and get your love (upbeat music) Wow, thanks, buddy. Wow. This is great.
It's you and me.
Oh, and what's that?
It's a surfboard, right?
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
He's obsessed, yeah.
BUCK: "Dear Buck, you are an awesome firefighter.
Love, Christopher." Very sweet, Christopher. Thank you.
(both laughing) All right, thank you.
(upbeat music) Ooh, so that's your future baby daddy.
Looks a little young.
No, this photo is, like, 20 years old.
For privacy reasons, they can't show you what he looks like now.
Yeah, and he's not a baby daddy.
He's a sperm donor.
Well, he is a cute sperm donor.
Mm-hmm.
And hey.
He's gonna make for a real cute kid.
(chuckles) You are so sweet.
I -- Oh, oh, God.
Hold me.
Ah...
(chuckles) Yo, I can't believe you managed to keep this a secret.
There's cake?
Uh, two cakes.
Yeah.
We weren't sure how today was gonna go.
So we had another one on standby in case you crashed and burned that said "better Buck next time." Aw.
Wow, you guys just gonna get married already?
Oh, don't forget to invite us.
* Okay.
Hey, right?
They are sending me the paperwork in the morning and you will officially be back.
How's that feel?
Oh, I'm just glad it's over.
You know, I hated not being with you guys.
Yeah, we missed you too.
It'll be nice to have the whole team back together.
Thanks, Cap. And I don't just mean for the party and the cakes. Um...
(soft music) Thank you for being there, you know, for the surgeries and the rehabs.
I, uh -- I know I wasn't always the easiest person to be around.
Oh, my God.
Oh, really?
No, you weren't that bad.
You should -- (coughing) Ex-girlfriend, sorry.
Hey, she just wasn't the right fit.
You'll find someone new.
Sorry, I, uh -- BOBBY: You okay?
(Buck coughing) Yeah, I -- (coughs) (dramatic music) * Buck?
(chokes) BOBBY: Buck?
* You got lucky. Most people who suffer a pulmonary embolism don't do it surrounded by trained medical professionals.
It saved your life.
So what caused the blood clot?
DOCTOR: Clots, plural.
There's the one that hit his lungs, and then there's two more in his leg.
As to the cause? It's unclear.
Yeah, but he just got a clean bill of health last week.
This came out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Did it?
No pain or tenderness in the leg?
Skin discoloration, swelling?
I thought I just pulled a muscle or something.
Okay, I-I've been training for my LAFD recertification test.
Well, it's not surprising.
Training hard can lead to dehydration, which can increase the risk of clots.
Okay, um, well, great. Look, I'm not dead.
You found the clots. When can I get out of here?
DOCTOR: We'll move you to a room.
Keep you on the anticoagulants.
Tomorrow, we'll run some more tests.
And then, we'll see.
Thanks, Doc.
You know what, I'm gonna go tell everyone that you're okay.
Let them know that you're staying awhile, all right?
When did your leg start bothering you?
Like a day or two ago.
Maddie, I-I was not ignoring this, okay?
I-I didn't know what it was.
I thought I had a leg cramp or something.
Yeah, well, you need to be more careful.
Because if this had happened when you were alone, you could have died.
But I --I didn't, okay? I just passed out -- Yeah, just passed out after vomiting up blood.
BUCK: What?
I don't --I don't remember that. I vomited up blood?
At Bobby and Athena's house?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
BOBBY: (exhales) ATHENA: Oh, Michael brought the kids to his place.
He's gonna keep them tonight.
Did he say how they're doing?
Well, May's been quiet, and Harry keeps asking if we're sure it's not Ebola.
(chuckles) Well, so much for our first party as a married couple.
Mm, well, maybe now they'll all stop complaining that we didn't have a wedding reception.
Where should we start?
Right here.
(phone buzzes) (phone clicks) Buck says that he is sorry about the blood and hopes he didn't ruin anything.
Oh, I raised two kids in this house.
A little ammonia, everything will be fine.
Just glad he's okay.
He is okay, right?
Oh, he was laser-focused on coming back to work, and I thought he was ready.
But now, I have to wonder.
Mm, you're worried that he's pushing himself too hard?
Yeah.
That's what I did. Thought I could handle it.
Lied to everybody. Ignored the pain.
I don't want him making the same mistakes that I did.
The job means a lot, but it shouldn't mean everything.
He's got to learn that.
Yeah, well, I understand the impulse.
Whenever I think of Harry and May about to take a stumble, my instinct is to throw myself in front of them, cushion the fall.
Well, Buck's not my kid.
No.
But he's also not you.
Maybe he's making the same mistakes you did.
Maybe he's not.
I mean, really, there's only one way to find out for sure.
Just wait and see.
You got to let them grow up sometime.
(dramatic music) (beeping) * Thank God, I wasn't sure that they were gonna send anyone.
BOBBY: You the one who called?
It's my dad, Jack.
We came to have lunch with him. He was acting weird.
And then, Dave, that's my brother, he noticed something on his stomach.
We tried to get a closer look, but he kicked us out and locked the door.
DAVE: Finally! Our father is having a medical emergency behind a locked door that no one in this damn place can seem to open.
(tense music) The lock's not the problem.
There's something on the other side keeping it from opening.
Your sister said that you saw something on your father's stomach.
Uh, these marks. Like wounds or maybe sores?
It was hard to tell.
Jack, this is LAFD. Will you please let us in?
* Not until those ungrateful vultures stop circling!
Dad.
Hey.
Ungrateful? Who does he think pays for this place?
JACK: You sold my house to pay for it!
Eddie, Chim, we're gonna have to storm the Bastille here.
He's acting like a child.
JACK: I am not.
CHIM: Storming the Bastille, Cap.
Copy.
He's old, Dave. And sad and lonely, living in this place, knowing he's dying.
Oh, wait, your father's ill?
(tense music) I didn't mean "dying" dying. I just mean -- JACK: You wish, you ungrateful brats.
He is 82.
And I'm as healthy as a horse.
And stubborn as a mule.
Hey, I'm your father.
You're not too old for the back of my hand.
Okay, well, then, come on out here and try it, old man.
My money's on you.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Mm-mm, no. That's not a rash.
Maybe MRSA.
Have you been to a hospital recently?
Ooh, that's the flesh-eating thing, right?
Oh, I'm gonna wash my hands.
It's not a MRSA.
Oh, yeah?
You sound pretty sure about that.
When did the symptoms start?
A few weeks back.
You know, I figured it would go away on its own, like crabs.
(quirky music) * Fine, I'll look.
Knock yourself out.
* Oh, what is that?
I don't know.
Maybe donovanosis.
Mm, well, there's something you don't see every day.
Thank you.
No, sir, it looks like you have a flesh-eating STD.
Don't thank me.
What kind of an 82-year-old gets an STD?
Actually happens more than you think.
Chlamydia, syphilis, on the rise in people over 65.
When I went off to college, you gave me a can of mace and a box of condoms.
Told me to always protect myself.
So what the hell, Dad?
DAVE: What do you mean you got condoms?
I just got the mace.
I didn't think anybody'd have you.
Oh, well, someone's clearly been having you.
Who is she?
She is none of your damn business.
Okay, sir, you're not required to tell us, but you do have to tell them at the hospital because she has to start a course of antibiotics immediately.
Um, everyone? My father, Jack here, has a flesh-eating STD.
So whomever he's been sleeping with should come to the hospital with us for immediate treatment.
Hm?
(indistinct chatter) (gasps) Okay, ma'am, please come with us.
(quirky music) * Oh.
What if you slept with one of the women that he slept with?
You should probably get that checked out too.
(stammers) What kind of a place is this?
I can't even with you!
You're supposed to be a role model.
He is to some people.
(laughing) Kids today.
* (indistinct radio chatter) (phone rings) Chief, what's going on?
BOBBY: You sure it's okay to be walking around like this?
BUCK: Yeah, they want me up and moving.
You know, it's better for the blood flow in my legs.
Seriously, if I'm not being poked or they're not testing me, they're making me walk.
So all that testing, do they have any theories yet as to what caused the clots?
Not yet, but the meds are working.
You know, they're gonna send me home tonight.
Oh, hey, um, do I need the hospital to sign some kind of form or anything, you know, for the Department?
My clearance?
Um...but you're not -- you're not cleared, Buck.
Not yet.
What --yeah --no -- I-I passed my physical and my recertification test.
I've got everything I-I need.
It's the blood thinners.
Department is concerned about liability issues, and since the doctors haven't figured out what's causing the clots...
Uh...
I can't come back to work?
Well, Buck, if we were out on a call and something happened to you -- And then, I would have two paramedics standing next to me.
I would be fine!
(tense music) Bobby, you --you know how hard I have worked for this.
They can't --they can't do this to me.
You --you can't let them take away my job.
Hey, we're not.
You were injured in the line of duty, and no one is forgetting that.
Chief Alonzo thinks that in a few weeks, if you're doing okay on the meds, he can clear you for light duty.
* Light duty?
Uh...
you mean like a desk job?
Now, listen, Buck, I -- Out there, in the world, helping people.
That is where I belong.
That is where I have spent five months fighting to get back to.
And now, you're gonna tell me I-I can't?
Listen, Buck, I know this is hard, but at least light -- No, I don't want light duty, okay?
And --and neither would you.
(soft music) * No, they are not putting me behind a desk.
* I quit.
* BOBBY: Maddie said Buck hasn't left the apartment in a week.
Yeah, she's tried to get him to go out a couple times, but it's always, "Why would I need to leave?
Everyone delivers." He won't even take my calls.
He's just sulking, Cap. He'll get over it.
Hey.
I like to give Buck crap as much as any of you lot, but this was a body blow, guys.
The guy's allowed some time to mourn.
The question is how much time.
I mean, his daily routine of walking from the bed to the couch and back again.
That's not gonna help the situation.
Look, I know it sucks, but that's life, right?
Whenever stuff didn't work out for me, my dad always told me to brush it off, keep moving forward.
It wasn't easy but he wasn't wrong.
But forward to what?
I mean, we all had lives, jobs before we entered the Department.
And we have things outside of it.
What --what does Buck have?
Buck has us.
Even though he may not believe that right now.
So what's Buck gonna do for the rest of his life?
I don't know. I'm not sure he even knows what he's gonna do with the rest of his day.
Although I suspect lying on the couch and bingeing cooking shows will play a small part.
As long as he's binging on the viewing and not the cooking.
I saw this one cooking show where the recipe called for five cans of store-bought frosting to make eight cupcakes.
Ew, I think I just got a cavity listening to that.
(laughter) Honestly, I don't know how to help him.
And he just seems so lost.
I don't know if I should just give him a swift kick in the butt and get him back out there or hug him and tell him that it's all gonna be okay.
Well, no rule says you can't do both.
True.
(sighs) (phone rings) Uh, 911, what's your emergency?
JILL: Help, please.
She took me.
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you.
What's your location?
JILL: Oh, no.
She stabbed me.
A woman stabbed you and took you.
Is that woman still there?
No, bleeding.
Okay, what's your name?
JILL: Jill.
We have a female stabbing victim.
She doesn't know the address and I can't pinpoint the location.
Okay, Jill, you said you were bleeding.
Is there anything you can use to put pressure on the wound?
I don't want to die.
That's right.
You don't want to die. So you're gonna fight.
And I'm gonna help you. Now focus.
Look around. Do you see a towel or anything that you can use?
JILL: Clothes.
Grab whatever it is.
Put it on that wound and press.
Roll over on the wound if you have to.
Just put pressure on it.
It hurts.
I know it does.
But you're gonna press, and you're gonna fight, and you're gonna stay with me.
We're gonna find you, Jill. Do you hear me?
(dramatic music) Jill?
Jill?
* MADDIE: Jill?
* The line's open, but still nothing.
Phone company gave me contact info for the account holder.
It's her husband.
Okay.
(clears throat) RICK: Hello?
Mr. Evans, hi.
This is, uh -- Maddie Buckley.
I am calling you from LA City Services and I was hoping that you could help me get in touch with your wife.
Do you know where she is?
RICK: Uh, not sure.
I think she was running some errands today.
Maybe shopping. Why?
Do you have any idea where she was going shopping?
What's going on? Where are you calling from?
MADDIE: Uh, I work for the city.
Your wife called us earlier with a request and we're just trying to get back in touch with her.
RICK: I can call her cell.
I tried that.
She wasn't answering.
RICK: That's not like her.
I wish I could remember.
She said something about clothes for the baby.
How old is your baby?
Jill's due next week. It's our first.
Jill's pregnant?
(dramatic music) * (sirens wail) (indistinct radio chatter) License, registration, and proof of insurance, ma'am.
Was I speeding or something?
ATHENA: Yep, and you blew through a stop sign.
(soft cooing) * I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
What is going on?
All right, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to take a seat.
ATHENA: Who's blood is that?
I don't -- what blood?
ATHENA: On your hands and your feet.
Did you do something to your baby?
NANCY: She's fine.
My baby is fine.
727-0-30, I have a newborn infant in respiratory distress.
She's turning blue.
(honking, sirens wailing) (dramatic music) * (indistinct radio chatter) BOBBY: Chimney, the NICU is prepped.
They're waiting for you.
ATHENA: Check the hospitals.
See if anyone's missing a newborn.
Williams!
Talk to dispatch.
Tell them to flag any strange calls involving a pregnant woman or someone missing a baby.
Hey, so how's the little one?
She lost some blood, and the umbilical cord wasn't tied off properly.
Baby can't be more than an hour old.
BRANFORD: Sergeant Grant?
ATHENA: Yeah?
So is she gonna be okay?
HEN: This baby wasn't born in a hospital.
BRANFORD: Found this in the trunk.
* ATHENA: And that woman is not the mother.
HOPE: I'm sorry, how did you get my number?
Your brother-in-law, Rick.
He said you and Jill were supposed to meet for breakfast this morning.
HOPE: Yeah, this place near my house.
Jill's become obsessed with their breakfast burritos.
Though I'm not sure how she can actually taste them with all the hot sauce she's been using.
And what time did you leave her?
HOPE: A little bit after 9:00. I had to get to work.
And did she tell you where she was going?
HOPE: She was going to get stuff for the baby.
Uh, clothes, I think.
Okay, where? A store?
HOPE: Did something happen to Jill?
Your sister called 911 and said she'd been attacked.
But she didn't know where she was and we're trying to find her, but I need your help.
HOPE: Oh, my God.
She's been trying to save money, buying used baby things she found online.
She didn't want Rick to know.
She knew he'd freak out.
Well, she was going to meet someone who'd placed an ad online?
Where?
HOPE: It was a public place.
It was supposed to be safe.
Vitals, blood glucose are normal.
No sign of impairment.
Yeah, whatever's wrong with that lady, we don't have a test for it.
Okay, well, dispatch said to stay here.
It's a critical missing.
Or a possible homicide.
Well, Chimney said the baby started to respond when they got to the hospital.
So maybe we'll get lucky twice today.
All right.
* ATHENA: Tell me where the mother is, Nancy.
What'd you do to her?
(chuckles) I'm the mother.
(tense music) Is Aria okay? When can I see her?
We both know that you're not that child's mother.
She's not your baby.
No! No, you don't understand.
She has to be. I-I promised.
Promised what?
NANCY: I promised George there was gonna be a baby.
There has to be a baby this time.
I don't know if you're insane or evil, but neither one is helping your situation right now.
Because if we do not find her in time, if she dies, things will not go well for you.
Now you tell me what you did with that baby's mother.
I'm the mother.
Sergeant, we got something.
Her sister said Jill was meeting a woman in Griffith Park by the pony rides.
All right, I'm two minutes out.
Okay, we checked the call logs.
Nothing from the park today. No reports of people seeing an assault or a woman in trouble.
The park's more than 4,000 acres.
She could've taken Jill anywhere.
Did Jill tell you anything about her location?
MADDIE: She sounded really disoriented.
All she said was it was dark.
There was a weird sound, though.
I heard it after she passed out.
Like a whistle, or maybe a horn.
* (horn blares) (indistinct radio chatter) I'm sorry, I haven't seen her.
BOBBY: I checked all the bathrooms.
She's not there.
Are you sure you didn't see her?
It would have been about an hour ago.
She'd be driving a 1996 burgundy Cadillac.
Wait, the red Caddy?
So you do remember?
No, I remember the car.
We cater to mostly the SUV and minivan crowd.
But that woman wasn't driving it.
It was some other lady. Different hair.
Okay, thank you.
Yeah.
* So Nancy moved the car, but why?
Throw us off?
Nancy meets Jill here, shows her the baby clothes.
They're out in the open, people can see them.
So she can't take the baby here.
She's got to get Jill alone.
Nancy walks Jill to her car, offers to put the clothes in her trunk.
Hits her in the head, throws her in the trunk and moves the car.
Jill did tell Maddie it was dark.
She's still in that trunk.
Nancy couldn't have driven far.
She needed to take that baby and carry it back to her own car.
(train whistle blows) ATHENA: Can you get a car back there?
Yeah, that's where we load the horse trailers in.
Bobby, there!
(dramatic music) * I tried the door. It's locked.
All right.
I got a pulse. It's weak, but it's there.
All right, let's get her out of there.
* MADDIE: Jill, Jill, are you there?
Jill, are you with me? Jill, can you hear me?
Jill, please respond.
Maddie.
MADDIE: Athena, is she -- ATHENA: Alive.
She's alive.
(exhales) I can't thank you enough.
If it hadn't been for all of you...
(soft music) ATHENA: Your wife doing okay?
Yeah, she made it through surgery and the doctors say she's doing well, all things considered.
Jill's a fighter. They both are.
You guys come up with a name yet?
You know, we had a list before.
Somehow, none of those seem right anymore.
You'll figure it out. You have time.
Yeah.
(baby cries) (soft music) You ready to go meet your mom, little girl?
* Oh, she is so tiny and sweet.
BOBBY: Are you and Chimney thinking about -- Well, you two just got married.
Are you?
Point taken.
(laughs) Well, people always say, "they grow up so fast." And they do, sort of.
But I'm not interested in resetting the clock for another 18 years.
18?
Buck is 28 and I still have my hands full.
What now?
See?
They don't grow up that fast.
(baby crying) * (upbeat music) * It's weird, right? Everyone's got baby fever.
Oh, my God, we are surrounded by people with kids, people trying to have kids, people eviscerating other people to get a kid.
(laughter) You know, we never really talked about that.
Is that something that you want?
To eviscerate someone?
To have kids.
I did.
But then, I got married, and it just never felt...
safe in that situation.
What about you?
Still adjusting to the idea that I'm not a kid myself.
No, seriously, uh...
I had a great mom that I lost too soon, a nonexistent father I barely speak to.
I just don't know if I'd know how to be a good parent myself.
Yeah, me, either.
I still feel like I'm carrying around too much baggage.
Okay.
So then, we don't know.
Yeah.
We are a firm maybe, someday.
Someday.
Wait.
Are we the only people we know who don't have kids?
both: Buck.
(upbeat music) (laughter) EDDIE: Get up.
(groans) Why, man? Come on.
(exhales) Because it's morning and you have things to do.
No, I really don't.
EDDIE: You need to get out of this house and take a walk around the block and get some fresh air.
Why? What's the point?
Well, the point is, your life isn't over just because you're not a firefighter.
Says the firefighter.
EDDIE: You know, that blood clot could've almost killed you.
But it didn't.
You have your whole life ahead of you, so why don't you just take it as a win and stop feeling sorry for yourself?
(exhales) CHRISTOPHER: Hey, Buck.
Hey, buddy.
Uh, what are you doing here?
He's hanging out with his Buck today!
Because I have to go work today.
Where's Carla?
She went to Morongo.
Mm-hmm.
So take him out, have some fun.
Maybe you'll learn something.
He never feels sorry for himself.
Love you, buddy.
Love you.
Love you, Dad.
(soft music) * (exhales) So what do you like to do for fun?
("This Is The Day" by The The plays) * Now which one do you want to go on next?
Down here? Come on, come on.
(vocalizes) * Great, right?
(laughs) What?
MAN: * Well, you didn't wake up this morning *
* Because you didn't go to bed *
* You were watching the whites of your eyes turn red *
* The calendar on your wall Mmm!
Good?
Yeah.
MAN: * The days off * You've been reading some old letters * (shutter snaps) * You smile and think how much you've changed * (laughter) MAN: * All the money in the world *
* Couldn't buy back those days * BUCK: This is for all the marbles.
CHRISTOPHER: Buck?
BUCK: Yeah, buddy?
I don't want the marble.
I want the bear!
(laughs) No, it's --it's just a figure of speech.
Now, you ready?
Yeah!
All right. I'm gonna hold here.
(bell rings) All right, all right, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
MAN: * Your life will surely change * Oh, you did it! Give me my high five!
(siren wailing) Oh-ho-ho-ho.
MAN: And we have a winner!
MAN: * And all your friends and family * CHRISTOPHER: Buck!
* Think that you're lucky * But the side of you they'll never see *
* Is when you're left alone Buck!
Oh, here, uh, sorry, I -- I got it.
* Hold your life together Are you okay?
MAN: * Like glue The universe is mocking me.
Let's go feed the fish.
MAN: * This is the day * Your life will surely change * You ever think about what you want to do with your life?
What you want to be when you grow up?
Astronaut or a pirate.
Some good choices.
Cool outfits too.
No, wait.
A firefighter!
(chuckles) Yeah, me too.
But, Chris, if those career paths don't work out, um...
(soft music) I hope you do find something you love.
You know, something you're good at.
That makes you feel like you matter.
Something you could do forever.
Because when you do, it's gonna tell you who you are.
And it's gonna show you the rest of your life.
And that is the best feeling.
* And I hope you get that.
And I hope you get to keep it.
You're gonna be okay, kid.
(dramatic music)
 @@@@@@
(carnival music) * (people screaming) Whoa!
(both yell) * Mmm.
Good?
Uh-huh.
* I'm so proud of you right now, I could not be more proud of you!
Come on, we're so close! So close!
(bell rings) (both yell) You did it! Come on, high five!
Ohh!
(sirens wail) And we have a winner!
(dramatic music) * BOY: Buck!
* WOMAN: He was passing out those fliers and he just collapsed.
Let's get his pulse.
BOY: Buck!
PARAMEDIC: I've got oxygen.
PARAMEDIC 2: Starting compressions.
* Full compressions.
BOY: Buck!
Ventricular defibrillation.
Shock needed. Clear!
Clear.
(electricity zaps) * There we go. Normal sinus rhythm.
All right.
(both chuckle) Ever think about what you wanna do with your life?
What you wanna be when you grow up?
Astronaut or a pirate.
Some good choices Cool outfits, too.
No, wait. A firefighter.
(chuckles) Yeah, me too.
Can you just hold steady for more than three seconds?
How's the sketch?
Will you just hold it steady?
Sheesh.
(whistle blows) (drops pencil) MAN: Hey, Reggie!
Fun police, 2:00.
Morning, Commodore.
No flying drones on the pier. We've talked about this.
Actually, what you said was no unauthorized drone flying on the pier.
But you're the Harbormaster. You could authorize it.
Or I can call a cop.
But we're making art!
Would you have called a cop on Michelangelo for scribbling on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?
If he were in violation of seventeen FAA regulations, yes.
Better do as he says, Charlie.
Your last warning.
Better not catch you doing it again.
Sorry, Reggie. Did you at least get it sketched?
Enough to get me started.
Okay.
Well, I need to get home anyway before my dad finds out I swiped his drone.
(both laugh) Thursday?
I'll be here.
(imitates explosion) Too close.
Charmed Life, Charmed Life, this is the Harbormaster.
Come in.
Charmed Life, be advised, you are too close to the pier.
It'll be an adventure.
It'll be a disaster.
Mom, have you taken a look at this boat?
It looks like you'll barely make it to Catalina, much less around the world.
Part of the adventure.
Oh, I've waited for this my whole life.
Out on the open ocean, just going wherever the waves take us.
(laughs) Wherever the waves take you.
See, that's not a plan, Chuck.
It's called life perspective, kid.
It's something you're too young to have yet.
Where does my mother fit into this...life perspective?
Ah, she's right at the heart of it. (laughs) Are you ready, my love? Padre is waiting.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these beautiful souls.
* (dramatic music) * CHRISTOPHER: Where did all the water go?
* (siren wails) Oh, my God.
Into the cabin, now!
(yelling) Go! Go!
(people screaming) Run!
(shouting) Run, run! Go!
Get off the pier!
Everyone, high ground! Incoming flood, let's go!
Move, move, move!
Let's go!
* (screaming) Get off the pier!
Here.
* (sirens wailing) CHRISTOPHER: Where did all the water come from?
(gasps, panting) Christopher!
Christopher! Christopher!
Christopher! Christopher!
Buck! Buck!
Buck!
Chris! Chris!
Chris, just --just stay there! I'm coming.
(intense music) * Ah.
* Just hang on.
Grab my hand! Christopher, reach out.
Grab my hand! No, Chris!
Chris! Chris!
Christopher! Stay over there!
I can't hold on!
Just hold on, Christopher!
Buck! Buck!
* (panting) Right, I got you!
I --I got you, I got you.
* (grunts) (grunts) * (panting) * (water flowing) (light music) * I'm not gonna lie, Tammy. I live for this.
Me and my baby girl getting treated like the queens we are. (chuckles) I don't lie, either.
I like having two standing appointments every month.
(both laugh) But I am gonna miss this young lady when she goes off to college.
Assuming I get accepted somewhere.
Not this again.
I haven't finished any applications.
I still need two letters of rec, and the U. C. app is a totally different thing.
And I haven't finished my essay.
Don't worry, baby. We'll --we'll figure this out.
(sighs) All these websites say you're supposed to write about something important.
Well, what if I haven't done anything important?
Well, you're 17. No one's expecting you to write about that time you cured cancer.
(laughs) Baby, why are you stressin' about this?
I shouldn't have come today.
You shouldn't have made me.
I should be studying for the ACT.
Well, I thought you could use a break.
Oh, my God.
Baby, you got this.
I know you do.
No, Mom. I don't.
(tires screech) (both gasp) (crashing) Any word on how Operation Buck Up Buck is going?
This was this morning.
"Full stack. Then I think the movies." Good luck.
By now, Chris has come down from a serious sugar high, and Buck is regretting his life choices.
Hey, did someone leave a hydrant open?
I don't think it's a hydrant, Cap.
(dramatic music) (alarm blaring) Baby, are you okay?
I'm okay.
(trying door) (grunts) It won't open.
(both grunting) Where'd you get that?
Your stepfather.
All right, shield your eyes.
(grunts) (alarms blaring) (horns honking) (chatter) * ATHENA: Okay. I am -- LAPD. Everyone okay?
Someone ran the light.
MAN: Whoa, look out! Hey, back up, get away from that.
Everyone, move to the side.
Move to the side! We have a downed transformer.
Steer clear of it.
WOMAN: Something's wrong.
I'm on with 911, but they've got me on hold.
It's a tsunami.
Took out the pier.
* No, keep going. Keep climbing. That -- We'll send a unit as soon as we can get into the area, and it may take a while.
Jonas, how we doing?
JONAS: Ah, I think I may have gotten myself into a situation here.
No luck with the window?
JONAS: Went a different direction.
Up.
You're in the attic.
Yeah. Wow, there's a lot of crap up here.
I thought maybe I could bust open a skylight, but it turns out, from inside the attic, it's just a wall.
Okay, well, let's work with what we've got.
Do you see anything you can use to break through the roof?
Uh -- Not so much.
Oh, wait a minute!
I forgot I had a pack up here.
A pack?
JONAS: Yeah, climbing gear.
My ex always said I was a gear-hoarder, She was right.
(laughs) Thank God she was. Found an axe.
(sighs) JONAS: Looks like I'm chopping through a roof.
(laughs) I kinda wish I had a bigger axe.
Or, better idea: look for a roof vent.
Attics need ventilation and the structure will be weaker there.
How'd you know that?
(sighs) Believe it or not, we have protocols for this.
Talking someone through how to break through the roof.
Didn't know I'd be needing it today, but glad I have it.
(grunts) Me too!
Ohh, all right. (laughs) Found a vent!
Okay, focus on the edges where the vent is attached to the sheathing.
Don't try to muscle your way through the middle of it.
(beeping) Swift Water Command, this is dispatch.
Checking on request for Code Three at 801 North Tenth Street.
SWIFT WATER COMMANDER: Delayed.
Boats haven't been able to get that far west yet.
Too many Code Threes in the water.
Jonas, talk to me. Any progress?
(grunting) (grunts) JONAS: It broke.
I'm not getting out of here.
MADDIE: No, no, no.
We are gonna keep fighting Me and you.
JONAS: I've summited six of the world's highest peaks.
I can't make it to the roof of my own house.
I'm gonna die in this stupid attic.
Come on, you must have had some pretty crazy adventures.
You survived them.
JONAS: I almost didn't once. (panting) K2 is a savage beast.
Horrible, unpredictable weather.
We were near the summit when the avalanche hit.
I got separated from the others.
I thought I was gonna die alone.
MADDIE: Well, you're not alone.
I'm here, Jonas. I'm with you.
JONAS: It was so cold, but bright.
The way the sun was bouncing off the snow, it didn't make any sense.
Dying, surrounded by all that sunshine.
But you didn't die that day.
JONAS: They found my line.
They pulled me out.
You ever make it to the summit?
JONAS: Oh, yeah.
It was like...
looking down on the sky (somber music) It was so beautiful.
Ah -- Jonas?
(beeping) * Jonas.
(beeping) (exhales) 911.
(clears throat) What's your emergency?
* (sirens wailing) (chatter) One wave did all of this?
* HARLAN: We already had two so far.
Expect another four or five before it starts to recede.
We're commandeering everything that'll float to supplement our Zodiacs.
I heard there were four firehouses in the path of this thing.
Yeah, they've all checked in.
Except for the 136.
They were responding to a call at the pier when the surge hit, so -- if you see any blue out there...
We'll holler.
* (panting) You good, Chris?
Yep. I took surfing lessons.
(laughs) Oh, well, maybe you can teach me.
(chuckles, sighs) All right, I'm gonna take a look around and see what I see.
I guess we're gonna have to hang out here a little longer.
We have a firetruck.
Yeah, we do.
WOMAN: Help!
Help me!
* Help!
BUCK: I'll help! Yeah!
I --I'm gonna come for you!
Help!
BUCK: Okay, okay.
Chris, um, I -- I need you to sit right here for me.
You promise me?
Yeah.
Okay, right here. Right here.
Yeah. Yeah.
WOMAN: Help! Help!
* Help! Help me!
* Help!
Here I am!
Hurry up!
(grunts) Hurry up!
MAN: Help, I can't get out.
I can't get out.
I --I'll help you. I will come back.
Okay, I promise you.
Help!
* (panting) (grunts) Help!
Help!
Hey! Hey, you can let go!
Okay? I need you to let go.
You can do it!
* Okay, you're doing great.
* You're doing great!
* Gimme that hand.
Okay, okay, okay.
You're doing so great. You're doing so great.
* Just climb up. You're okay. You got it.
* Buck. People.
(panting) MAN: Please!
all: Help! Help!
WOMAN: Somebody -- Will you watch him?
Okay.
Yeah?
MAN: Help!
MAN: Help!
WOMAN: Help us, please!
WOMAN: Help us! Please help!
(chatter) LINDA: No. The line's still open.
Protocol says we do not hang up.
Not until help arrives or they're safe.
SUE: You said he was in a flooding car.
(Linda sighs) SUE: It's been over 20 minutes since he said anything, Linda.
The line's still open.
I --I can't -- (hangs up) (dial tone buzzes) It's okay. Go take a break.
* I never thought I'd see you disconnect a call.
(sighs) Water-resistant phones.
They can keep working for 30 minutes after being submerged.
Ain't technology great?
How are you holding up?
I have both feet on dry land. I'll be okay.
Good. This day's not over.
Okay, what can I do.
You used to run an emergency room, right?
Well, that's what this is.
I need you on the floor with me doing triage.
Okay, but we have a system in place to prioritize the calls.
Well, not the calls, I need you to triage them.
Make sure they're doing okay.
Identify where we can help and be brutal about where we can't.
Be the bad guy if you have to.
Like you just did with Linda.
Today's gonna take a toll...
on all of us.
* (alarm blaring) Okay, let's work fast, people, in between waves.
* (beeping) WOMAN: Help!
Please!
Help!
Cap!
I see it, Chim.
* WOMAN: Help!
Get into my arms.
Don't move, sir.
We'll be right there.
Be careful, guys. Unstable.
WOMAN: And my sons are inside. Please hurry!
I'll check you out, sir.
* I'm suck.
Gentlemen, can you hear me?
MAN: Yes!
(man groans) All right.
Antenna from the radio station pierced the hull.
Then it pierced them.
(pained groans) They're skewered together from the shoulder...
through the abdomen...
to the bottom of the boat.
And this boat is taking on water.
We need a plan, Cap, and we need it fast.
(pained grunts) HEN: Normally, we'd travel them both with object intact, and let the ER sort it out.
Except for this case, the object is a radio station antenna and a boat.
We need to separate them. Can we do that?
It seems to have missed the kid's heart and lungs.
I'm not sure about the stepdad.
He's got about a half dozen vital organs it could've hit, So as long as we keep both pieces in them, maybe.
That's not a no.
Adele, please.
No, I'm not leaving you -- either of you.
Whatever happened to love, honor and obey?
I never said "obey." We didn't even finish the ceremony.
It's okay, Mom. Please, just go.
He's right, ma'am. Best thing to do now is just let us work.
I love you both so much.
HEN: I got you, I got you.
Let's get you to the boat.
Okay, we have a plan.
Only one plan...you save this kid.
What? No, Chuck, you're already insufferable.
Don't be insufferable and magnanimous.
I can't take it.
CHUCK: She is the love of my life.
He is the love of hers.
Save...save him.
Our job is to save you both, so that's what we're gonna do.
Cover 'em up, Eddie.
Got you.
* All right.
Eddie, Hen, I need you to lift him up.
And Jason, if you can get on your knees at all, I need you to try, okay?
HEN: Careful, it's gonna hurt.
Turn your head away.
(saw grinding) JASON: Oh!
(pained grunts) Okay.
Let's get him up.
(groans) Jason. Oh, shh, it's all right.
What about Chuck?
Abdomen's distended and warm.
I'm pretty sure his spleen's ruptured.
He'll probably lose too much blood if we pull him off this.
We'll have to cut from underneath.
Underneath what?
Always did love Jacques Cousteau as a kid.
You and me, both.
* Cap's in the water.
* BOBBY: Chimney, you seeing this?
* CHIMNEY: We got another surge!
* This is a problem.
Hey, you said you were a cop. Why can't you take a report?
Sir, do I look like I'm on duty?
Well, can you get someone down here who is?
Her insurance needs to pay for this.
What are you talking about?
You rear-ended me!
It's a pile-up!
People, people!
There's some real trouble down by the beach.
Y'all waiting for help to come? It's already here.
And it's us.
Check in with your neighbor. See if anyone needs help.
We're all we've got right now.
* (horn honking) (honking) Hey.
Oh, thank God.
What's your name?
Vicky.
All right, Vicky, can you move?
Yeah.
Just not out of here.
My leg is pinned, and I don't know how much longer I can keep the pressure on this.
Okay, okay.
The blood's not pumping out of the wound.
I think that's a good thing.
Just hold it there another second.
* May!
Come on, I need your help!
* Come here.
I need you to put pressure on this while I go get the first aid kit.
Mom, I --I -- Just for a minute.
Okay.
May. May! Look at me.
Now is not the time for you to be frightened.
So put your hand here and hold it.
Come on.
* Not too much pressure. Okay.
I'll be right back.
* (grunts) * VICKY: Your name's May?
I'm Vicky.
Hi.
Did I hear someone say there was a tsunami, or...
am I dreaming?
There was.
Wow.
MAN: Sewer's backing up.
ATHENA: It's just spillover.
(electricity crackles) MAN: I want that report!
Officer!
Sir!
Officer!
(electricity zapping) * ...unusual, right?
Oh, God!
Oh, my God. Mom!
Mom!
(electricity crackles) May! May! No, stop!
Go back into that van until I tell you to come out.
Do you hear me?
Oh, God.
Vicky, come on.
Okay.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're fine. You're gonna be fine.
* EDDIE: Water's coming faster, Cap!
Copy that, Eddie.
I'll bang three times on the hull when it's done.
Chuck? Can you hear me?
He's not breathing.
How's his pulse?
We gotta do CPR underwater.
CPR underwater?
We can't do compressions unless he's flat.
How's he gonna get air?
He's not breathing anyway.
It's just to keep him from drowning.
At least for a minute.
There's a scuba mask over there.
Grab it, put it on him.
* Three, two, one.
* You got him?
* Nothing.
* Nothing.
* Nothing.
* (clanging) Eddie, antenna is clear.
* I got a pulse!
Free the mask.
(coughs) (sighs) There we go. Welcome back, Chuck.
(laughs) Oh, hell of a save, Hen. Hell of a save.
I can't believe it worked.
Bring in that backboard!
(laughter) Can't believe it worked.
Ready? One, two three.
MAN: If you read, 118, we need backup at the Santa Monica Pier.
Good job down there, guys.
BOTH: Thanks.
CHIMNEY: Copy that. Cap!
The man is asking for available hands down at the Pier.
Okay, Chim, Hen, you transport the patients.
Copy that.
Eddie, you're with me.
BOTH: Copy that.
We'll regroup at the staging area.
* I got 911, finally.
This is Athena Grant, LAPD.
I'm at the intersection of Brockton and Wilshire There's a multi-car pile-up with serious injuries.
We got water in the street and a downed transformer.
I need a DWP crew right now!
DISPATCHER: All DWP crews are engaged.
The power's not out in your area, Sergeant.
I know the power is not out. That's the damn problem.
I got folks out here dying in the street.
DISPATCHER: Nearest DWP crew is at Rose and Granville.
They can be there within the hour.
That's not gonna work.
We got a woman bleeding out here.
* No, no, no. Don't lie down. No, no, don't lie down.
Come on.
Stay on hold.
Who are you calling?
Jacobs. JACOBS: Yeah?
This is Athena.
I need you to find me a black and white.
The closest thing you got to Rose and Granville.
May. It's okay.
* No, no! But -- No, you have to sit up.
There was less blood when you were sitting up.
Come on.
It's okay.
Stop saying that!
It's not okay. It's not.
Help is coming. My mom's out there.
She'll figure something out.
Just keep your head up. Come on.
Keep my head up.
Keep your head up.
Yeah.
Come on, Vicky, you can.
Okay, you're gonna stay awake, and you're gonna stay alive.
I need to rest.
I don't give a damn.
I'm sure there are people who love you, who expect you to make it home to them.
Okay, no offense, but I never wanna have to meet them and tell them how you died in my arms.
I'm 17 years old.
You're not gonna traumatize me like that, got it?
Nobody in this car's dying. Not today.
You're one tough cookie, you know that?
(siren wails) You got someone trapped in a car?
Yeah, two. I got two someones.
We're clear.
(sirens wailing) (horn blares) May, I'm here.
* I tried to keep her awake.
I really tried, Mom.
Come on.
Come on.
(somber music) * PARAMEDIC: Stretcher coming through.
* FEMALE PARAMEDIC: We've got a pulse.
MALE PARAMEDIC: Okay, let's go, let's go.
She's alive.
Yes, baby. She was alive because you kept her alive.
(sobs) Hey, hey. Hey! Who -- I was so scared.
Of course you were.
But you did good. Just like I knew you would.
I'm not you, Mom.
Well, I wasn't always me, either.
It took me a minute to get here.
You'll get there.
(both crying) * Hey, you doing okay?
Yep, still people out there who need our help, so that's what I'm gonna do.
I think Ann needs a break.
Code Three. Tension pneumo.
I sent the ambulance to St. Mary's in Culver, but they're telling me they're tapped out.
Okay, and the three closest hospitals are flooded.
What about UCLA?
They just asked me to reroute three calls.
Playa Vista's gonna be your best bet.
(phone buzzing) Hi, Chimney. You guys okay?
Yeah, we're all fine, but I'm hoping you can help me cut through some red tape.
We keep pulling Level Ones out of the water and we have no place to send 'em.
We're sending victims to every dry hospital we can find.
We have a system in place.
CHIMNEY: Well, whoever's in charge of that system is doing a terrible job.
That would be me.
A terribly good job under extremely difficult circumstances.
So, what, the hospitals recall all their staff?
It's not about staff. They are flooded with staff.
It's about beds and space.
(sighs) What we need is a field hospital.
A triage, closer to the water.
Stabilize and move 'em inland as beds open up.
Wait. The VA hospital on Sawtelle, it's not far from where you are now and it's out of the flood zone.
Why aren't we sending patients there now?
Because it was decommissioned two months ago.
CHIMNEY: It'll be totally empty.
Right.
Right.
See, I told you you were doing a great job.
Uh-huh. I'll talk to Sue and see if we can make this happen.
Okay, sounds good. Oh...
one other thing, how are you?
Honestly?
(sighs) Happy to hear your voice.
And weirdly grateful that my brother has a serious blood clot condition and is nowhere near this nightmare.
(laughs) MADDIE: Is that wrong?
Not at all.
Okay, I spy, with my little eye, something that...moves people around.
Um -- Oh. A scooter.
Ah, yeah. Nice one. (chuckles) Okay, genius. Your turn.
I spy a shopping cart.
What? No, come on.
Hey, that's not how the game works.
You can't just yell stuff out.
But yelling stuff out is the fun part!
You amaze me, buddy.
Why?
I got some bad news at work the other day, and I didn't wanna get out of bed for a whole week.
But you, after the day you had, here you are, with a big smile, bustin' a gut.
(chuckles) You never gave up.
Even when that water was rushing over you back there.
You just kept on swimming.
Like Dory.
(chuckles) Yeah, like Dory.
And not just today. You know, but every day.
You never say no, you never complain.
How --how do you do that?
Well, I complained once, but it didn't work.
So what did you do?
Just kept on swimming.
Like Dory.
MAN: Oh, my God, look over there. Oh.
WOMAN: Do you see that? WOMAN 2: Oh, my god.
WOMAN: Oh, no.
I --I spy, with my little eye, something that is high.
A street sign?
Uh, high --higher than that. Like, whoa -- * Maddie, I just got off the phone with the Deputy Mayor and State Emergency Services.
Everybody's on board with the VA field hospital.
When will it be operational?
Well --thank you. Let's see, generators and cots are being sent over now.
And they said that we can start routing patients in an hour.
That's great.
Oh, can you call ME-Coroner and Red Cross?
Tell them bodybags need to be sent to the VA.
5,000 to start.
(intense music) * You see this, Cap?
Kinda hard not to, Eddie.
Jesus Christ.
* (people clamoring) * (both speaking Spanish) Wait, who's up there?
 La bombera.
Hey, we could use a hand up here.
Fire lady.
I don't know what I'm gonna tell your father.
You know, I take you out one time and, uh...
look what happens.
You saved me.
And you saved them.
No, we did that together.
Me and you make a great team.
Give me a high five. I'm proud of you. Really.
Thank you, Buck.
Thank you.
(alarm wails) NEWS ANCHOR: We're getting reports of another surge Our correspondent -- Oh, my God. Not another wave.
No, same wave. It's going in the other direction.
Back out to sea.
* This isn't over.
* (clanging, metal screeching) KEVIN: No, no, no! (screams) Kevin!
(clanging) (yelling) Incoming! Debris!
* (screaming) Hey, everybody get down!
Get down and hold on! Hold on!
* MAN: Help!
MAN: Please!
WOMAN: Please help!
* Hold on!
(screaming) Ah!
Ah, ah, Christopher!
Christopher!
No! (panting) * Christopher! Christopher!
 @@@@@@
REPORTER: The massive tsunami struck the Southern California shoreline...
(reporters' voices overlapping) REPORTER: First responders search for the many still missing and feared dead.
BUCK: Chris! Christopher!
Christopher!
(dramatic music) (breathing heavily) Christopher!
Has anyone seen a boy in the water?
Come on. Hey!
He's got brown hair, glasses, yellow T-shirt...
have you seen a little boy?
No, I'm sorry.
(panting) * (grunting) * (sirens wail) (tense music) (birds squawking) Really? You wanna do this here?
Might as well end it where it started, right?
Scene of the crime, where you said "yes." I can't tell if your romantic nostalgia is adorable or just sad.
Five years, Stace. We've come full circle.
Literally. The metaphor alone is -- Look, Max, we're here to sign divorce papers.
And we will.
No hard feelings, no drama, but...
(scoffs) Why not remember where it began in the first place, right?
End on a high note.
Yeah.
MAX: This is for all the marbles.
(bright carnival music) * (desolate music) * The view's still amazing.
It certainly is.
And you're still just as bad at flirting as you were back then.
MAX: In the air, it's like nothing's changed, same city, same water...
Different people.
* It's time.
Uh, I forgot my pen.
I've got two.
* STACEY: And just like our marriage, this ride is suddenly going nowhere.
MAX: I slipped the guy 50 bucks to give us a few minutes alone.
STACEY: That's a sweet gesture, but what did you think would happen?
I don't know, some kind of sign, maybe.
Signs are a thing. Signs happen.
In the movies, Max, but not in real life.
(siren blaring) Not the kind of sign I was hoping for.
(ominous music) (crowd clamoring) * Oh, my God, Max.
* (wave crashing) * (glass shatters) (tense music) * WOMAN: Please help over here. MAN: Please help.
STACEY: Help! We're here!
Help! I see boats, Max, rescue boats.
Help's coming.
* I can't feel your hand.
What?
Yeah, I can't feel much of anything.
They'll fix it, Max. Everything can be fixed.
Not everything.
MAN: Multiple calls from the Ferris wheel, Captain.
Okay, we're coming.
* Hey, up here! Help, here!
My husband's hurt. Please!
MAN: Help these guys in front. MAN: Copy.
Move in here.
All right, yeah.
Let's go get them right over there.
* Oh, thank God you're here.
We're save. We'll be okay.
(speaks Spanish) (man speaking Spanish) Wait, who helped them?
(speaks Spanish) Hey, we could use a hand up here!
* Fire lady.
All right, grab an extra harness, rope, pulleys, figure eight plates.
I'll coordinate evac and transport some down here.
EDDIE: Sounds like a plan, Cap.
* Okay.
(clattering) (Ferris wheel squeaking) WOMAN: Oh, my God! MAN: Oh, no!
That's not part of the ride.
No, the spokes are coming off the hub.
This thing's been thrashed.
What about you? Are you hurt?
No, and neither is he.
I'm not going anywhere, not until the water's gone.
Sir, if you don't come with us, this whole thing will be gone.
Don't worry, buddy. I'm gonna get you down safely.
I'm just gonna put this harness around you, okay?
Okay, okay. All right.
Eddie Diaz, 118.
Lena Bosko, 136.
You were on the pit when it hit.
Yeah.
Where's your crew?
LENA: Got separated...
to all the spin cycle.
All right.
Let's get you up. Let's get you up.
There we go.
Okay.
There we go.
Thank you.
Be careful.
(machinery creaking) Don't drop me. Don't drop me.
Oh, God! Oh, God.
(dramatic music) * WOMAN: Oh, my God.
(woman screaming) MAN: Get me in the boat. Get me in the boat.
RESPONDER: We've got you. We've got you, just relax.
We got you, sir. We got you.
* RESPONDER: Watch your step.
When the wave hit, how'd you get back here?
Swam.
You sure did and then you climbed.
Free climb on the weekends, soldier.
How'd you know I was in the service?
You all carry yourselves the same way.
All that spit and polish. My captain served, army.
EDDIE: Must be a good man.
* EDDIE: Ma'am, stay put. We're coming to you.
STACEY: Thank you. We're okay.
LENA: Stay where you are. We're coming.
STACEY: Please hurry. Hurry!
LENA: Hold on. Just a little bit longer.
* Oh, thank God you're here!
What happened here, Ma'am?
STACEY: He hit his neck when the wave came, and he can't feel his fingers.
MAX: My arms went numb.
A couple minutes later, my legs gave out.
Am I paralyzed?
That's too soon to tell.
You said you lost sensation in your arms first and then your legs?
Yeah.
EDDIE: Okay.
Well, that might be a sign of swelling, which means you bruised your neck instead of breaking it.
(metallic scraping) (all yelling) Hey, Cap, we can get one down to you, but the other one's a possible spinal.
We're gonna need a Hail Mary.
BOBBY: I'll order one up for you.
Coast guard, coast guard. This is Captain Nash LAFD.
We need a miracle at the pier. We need one quick.
You should be fine. Help's on the way.
All right.
* (helicopter whirring) * You see, Max? How's that for a sign?
There's hope, so fight.
* Max, you moved your fingers.
I think I'm getting some feeling back.
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.
Give me the pen, Stacey, and those papers.
Max...
We were always a disaster, weren't we?
(solemn music) * What a beautiful disaster we were.
* (dramatic music) * (helicopter whirring) * Incoming, debris!
(metallic clanging) This thing is gonna go down. Let's go.
Go, go, go!
Free climb, how 'bout free fall?
* (motor revving) * Here, here, here, here, here, here.
* (crashing) DISPATCHER: There's a truck on its way, Captain.
Copy that. Nash out.
Our team is still stuck on the other side.
Our trucks can't get through just yet.
Earth movers are still clearing the roads.
118's hoofing it for a while.
It looks that way.
Hen and Chimney are readying some turnout backpacks until we're mobile again.
Bosko, your crew from your house are all alive and accounted for except for Captain Cooper.
He's still MIA.
I'm sorry.
Well, if it's all the same to you, Captain, I'm gonna stick around and look for him.
Why are you holding yourself like that?
It's nothing, bruised rib.
Let me take a look at it.
I said it's nothing.
Clearly, it's not.
Are you gonna drop this?
BOBBY: Hey, Bosko, let him have a look.
I'm not asking.
(tense music) * Yeah, that's not a bruise. It's broken.
Must be hurting like a bitch.
Yeah, well, breathing isn't super fun.
I'm calling it. You're off the field.
Sir, I said I'm fine.
* USAR Command is setting up the VA hospital on Sawtelle.
I want you to stick with her just in case her desire to track down her captain causes her to lose her way.
I'm gonna meet up with the 118.
Rendezvous with us when you can.
EDDIE: Copy that, Cap.
* Who you calling?
EDDIE: My son.
Lost his mother a few months ago, don't want him to worry.
Hey, Buck, it's me.
I just want you to tell Christopher I'll be a little late picking him up, got our hands full here.
It's good thing you're missing it.
Hope you guys are having fun.
* (engine puttering) (suspenseful music) WOMAN: Hey! There's a kid under here!
BUCK: Christopher? Hey!
Hey, guys...hey, hey, big guy! Me and you, come on!
All right, three, two, one. Go!
* Ah.
MAN: Oh, my God. WOMAN: I got you.
MAN: Yeah! Yeah! (applause) WOMAN: Okay. Ooh, you're okay.
WOMAN: Got you.
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me.
I'm looking for an eight-year-old boy.
His name is Christopher.
He's always smiling, and he's got CP, Cerebral Palsy.
He's got brown hair, yellow shirt.
Yeah, yeah. I think I saw him.
Where?
He was headed with a group to that Cupcakery place.
I heard they're handing out water.
Cupcakery, what is that?
You know, cupcake bakery.
It's about six or seven blocks south of here on Strand.
Thank you. Thank you.
* Dizziness, mild seizure, in and out of consciousness -- Tell the responders they may be treating a subdural hematoma and to mark it as a Code Three on the priority list.
Before or after the guy with the fishhook in his eye?
(sighs) Dealer's choice.
Whoever they get to first.
911, what's your emergency?
LOUISE: Yes, I'm calling from Kenosha, Wisconsin.
My daughter is missing -- Ma'am, I don't know how you got put through to me, but this is Los Angeles.
LOUISE: I know that.
Joanna was texting me from her place near the beach, but her texts became, like, gibberish.
And now, I can't reach her at all.
Okay, I understand. Can I get your name?
LOUISE: Louise Hickey.
Louise, do you know if your daughter is on any medications?
LOUISE: She's a health nut.
I don't even think she takes aspirin.
I know you're worried, but before you assume the worst, there are a number of reasons Joanna's phone may have stopped working, water damage alone.
LOUISE: No, she was texting after the tsunami.
She and her neighbors were all safe in the lounge on the 10th floor.
Can't you send somebody over there?
I'll see what I can do, but understand that our first responders and emergency crews are already stretched to the brink.
LOUISE: Please, whatever you can do.
She's at the Ocean Plaza Apartment Complex on Ocean Avenue.
Ocean Plaza, right.
Okay, you stay strong, Louise, and let us know if you hear from your daughter.
Hey, Linda, didn't I hear you taking a call a little while ago, something about the Ocean Plaza Apartment Complex?
Yeah, a caller was having trouble reaching his boyfriend, said their phone conversation cut off mid-sentence, then nothing.
(tense music) * I checked the Red Cross and social media to see if anyone from Ocean Plaza had marked themselves as safe.
Not one mention of it anywhere.
Let me see if I understand this correctly.
With everything we've got on our plate, you wanna send help to the only building in the area that isn't asking for any?
Yeah, I guess I do.
Please don't take offense, but are you okay?
Yes, Sue, I'm fine.
But if something bad happened at that address, and I didn't -- I get it, but unless we can confirm an emergency with someone on site, our hands are tied, Maddie.
We don't have the resources.
* (drone buzzing) WOMAN: Charlie, what are you doing?
Looking for Reggie.
WOMAN: You're not planning on going outside?
No.
WOMAN: It's still not safe out there.
(dog barks distantly) (dramatic music) Oh, sick.
Maddie, I've got this kid on the line, but I can't tell whether or not I'm being pranked.
* Hi. Who am I speaking with?
CHARLOTTE: Why do you need to know that?
So I know what to call you.
I just wanna know if you guys know about the frogman.
Say again.
CHARLOTTE: Frogman.
He might be dead.
He's in a tree, but you can't see him from the street.
Then how did you spot him?
CHARLOTTE: With my drone.
I'm looking for my friend. His name's Reggie.
He's an artist -- So you have a drone?
CHARLOTTE: DX-Black Bird R20.
If you want, I can send you a link to a live feed.
Yes, please.
I'm in. There's movement.
Dispatch a ladder crew down to Rose and Third.
Thank you, Charlotte.
You may have just saved a man's life.
Wait, what? How did you...
MADDIE: We've got Caller ID, a really good one.
"Charlotte Rain Fingado," that's your name, isn't it?
CHARLOTTE: It's Charlie. Wow.
You're like Big Brother's big sister.
Something like that.
I think we can help each other out.
How far can your drone fly?
(dramatic music) (drone buzzing) * Keep going, Charlie. We need to find an opening.
* I don't think these windows open.
No, but maybe there's a vent or...
There.
Can you move in closer or zoom in?
CHARLOTTE: Zooming.
What are we looking for, again?
* I think we found it.
* ATHENA: All right, y'all have your assignments.
Fan out, make your presence known.
Might take the national guard more than a minute to get on the stick.
Until then, we are the first line of defense against looters, all right?
If you see anything that looks like more than a misdemeanor, call for backup.
We are not looking the other way on this.
Arrests will be made.
Understood?
All right, move out.
Be smart, stay safe.
(sirens whooping) Hey, everything okay, Suze?
Sergeant, they're asking for help finding their people.
I tried to tell them -- Folks, for your own safety, we need you to clear the streets.
Make your way to the emergency shelter.
My wife is missing, and you're not gonna do anything?
We are doing everything that we can.
Now, there are people at the shelter who can take your name and reconnect you with your wife or whoever is missing.
DISPATCHER: 7-2-7-L-30. 7-2-3-L-30, come back.
Muchas gracias.
Dispatch, 7-2-7-L-30.
DISPATCHER: Multiple reports of possible burglary suspects.
MAN: Hey, everyone, fresh water to your left, first aid and blankets to the right.
(baby cries) (foreboding music) * Christopher.
(relieved sigh) Christopher! I'm here.
Hey, Christopher!
(somber music) * (panting) * BOY: Mister, are you okay?
You're bleeding.
* (Buck grunting) BOY: Can I get you something for that?
(ominous music) Sword of Damocles at 12:00, Cap.
I see it.
John, can you get some caution tape up around that streetlamp before somebody gets nailed by it?
* Okay, until we know what's what, masks go on and they stay on.
* (door thuds) * HEN: Schematics put the stairs over...
(device beeps) CO.
CHIMNEY: A hell of a lot of it, 212 PPMs.
BOBBY: Okay, Hen, Geary, check building maintenance, central heating units.
Find the source and shut it down.
Everybody else on me. Dispatch to tenth floor.
MAN: Copy that. HEN: Copy that.
* CHIMNEY: PPMs at over 300, Cap.
Probably being vented in all -- RAFI: Ah!
Ah, I'm not falling for it...who's the mess about?
Sir. Sir, we are here to help.
Try to calm yourself.
You're suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.
Need to very much...nomenclature.
(sniffs, retches) CHIMNEY: Did he just say "nomenclature"?
BOBBY: All right, get him outside.
Residents must have taken higher ground as the water rose.
CHIMNEY: Unfortunately, the gas did too.
Concentration is highest here at the top.
Let's hope we're not too late to the party.
* Okay, let's go, go, go.
(gas hissing) Got a pulse here, it's steady, but her face has discoloration.
BOBBY: All right, we gotta get some fresh air in here ASAP.
(glass shatters) HEN: Building's backup generator got damaged by the seawater.
We managed to put it out of its misery.
Okay, start bringing them down, get 'em on O2.
This is Ladder 118, Captain Nash requesting medical transport at Ocean Plaza Apartment Complex, nine-nine Ocean, north entrance for -- 17 minimum, Cap.
At least 17 patients, acute CO poisoning, ASAP.
DISPATCHER: Copy request, Ladder 118.
All ambulances currently engaged.
Stand by.
Standing by.
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. You shouldn't get up.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just need...
Hey, okay. Hold on, I got you.
I need to call my mom.
I need to call...
did you take my phone?
What's your name?
"Jonana." Joanna?
Yeah, that's it.
Okay, Joanna, I'm Hen.
You can call your mom once you get settled at the hospital, okay?
Okay.
Right now, you should sit down.
I just wanna sit over --ah!
Okay, all right. Okay, are you okay?
What's hurting?
My ankle.
I cut it yesterday at the gym. The water's making it sting.
(suspenseful music) * (electricity zapping) Bobby?
Yeah.
* Bobby, we gotta find a way to move all these people.
Already on it, just gonna take some time for the ambulances to get here.
We don't have time.
That gas truck down the street, it's leaking gasoline into the water.
* We're standing on top of a bomb.
DISPATCHER: Be advised, full evacuation in effect in national park.
Looters reported in the prospect.
ATHENA: Copy that.
(tense music) (dog barking distantly) * (sirens wail, helicopter whirs distantly) * (car door slams) TITO: Did you get 'em all?
Yeah.
We should check next door.
Saw a couple of silver bowls through the window.
TITO: We're hauling as much as we can carry already, man.
I don't think we can fit no more.
ATHENA: LAPD.
Both of you, put your hands in the air.
(anxious music) You wanna drop that box, Boss?
Uh...I can't.
Oh, I bet you can.
I don't wanna scare 'em.
ATHENA: Scare who?
* (cats purring) * (cat mews) * (dog whines) You're looting animals?
TITO: Looting?
No, eh, we're saving 'em.
Look, check it out.
See? Yeah.
We reunite owners with pets who get separated during natural disasters, fires, those sorts of things.
We call ourselves The Raiders of the Lost Barks.
TITO: No, we don't.
Ray, we talked about this. Come on.
RAY: I'm just trying it out.
TITO: Yeah, it's lame.
ATHENA: You two have ID on you?
* Much as I appreciate your cause, I can't let you just break into people's houses.
You see, technically, we're not really breaking in.
You'd be surprised how many homeowners leave their windows and backdoors unlocked.
Yeah, you should see Ray here navigate himself through the occasional doggy door.
I'm double-jointed.
Yeah?
Well, technically, it's still a felony.
Okay, I tell you what.
Overheard you say you got more than you can fit.
I think it's best if you boys just take care of your present cargo.
Leave the rest for the ASPCA.
TITO: Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
TITO: You too. RAY: Yeah.
TITO: Come on, man. "Raiders of the Lost Bark." You lost your mind, think I'm gonna walk around with a shirt...
RAY: It's a good name. TITO: It's not.
(metallic clang) (suspenseful music) (metallic clanging) * EDDIE: Hey. Hey!
My friend's got at least one broken rib and showing signs -- NURSE: Can I get your names for the list, please?
You have a list?
Excuse me.
EDDIE: Lena.
Lena.
First we get you fixed up, then you can spiral out.
I'm Eddie Diaz. This is Lena Bosko.
Have you seen a Ronnie Cooper on the list?
Fire captain, station 136.
I haven't.
Head on inside and someone will be with you.
(solemn music) * (machine beeps) WOMAN: Don't be scared, baby. I'm fine.
It doesn't hurt.
I'm gonna need more gauze.
Okay, Diaz, you got your wish. I'm here.
You don't have to babysit me.
Yeah, I get it. If my captain was out there -- Coop's not just my captain, okay?
He believed in me. He made me who I am.
(machine beeps) He remind you of your son?
I guess a little.
(Kyle coughing) Sorry about his mom. That's rough.
(Kyle coughing, gagging) WOMAN: Kyle, what's wrong?
He's drowning.
WOMAN: What?
(Kyle gasping, coughing) (tense music) (gurgling) WOMAN: What's in his mouth?
(gagging) WOMAN: Oh, my God.
(gasps) Kyle, baby, I'm here.
Short breaths, Kyle. Nice and easy.
Nice and easy. All right, on three.
One, two, three.
MEDIC: Get him to X-ray.
See which pulmonary specialist is available.
(peaceful music) WOMAN: Thank you.
Delayed secondary drowning.
I've never seen one of those.
Good catch.
Paramedic?
No, but I was a medic in the service.
In case you couldn't tell, we are severely shorthanded.
Any chance that you could -- Yeah, sure, just point me where to wash up.
Sorry, looks like you're not getting rid of me anytime soon.
* ATHENA: Hello?
(man moans) (metallic clang) ATHENA: Is someone there?
Hello?
(suspenseful music) Hey.
MAN: Yes?
Here.
Hey, hang in there. I'm coming to you.
(clanging, clattering) (grunts) Hold on, hold on.
* I got you.
Captain.
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?
(gasps) Who says there's never a cop around when you need one?
Okay, you hang on.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
7-2-7-L-30 requesting immediate medical assistance near the corner of 18th and Wellesley Drive.
DISPATCHER: Copy request, L-30.
Be advised, EMTs approximately 30-35 minutes out.
Too long, too late.
Do what you can to shave down that estimate, Central.
* We'll see if I can find a jack to free your arm.
COOPER: My arm's gone.
I belted if off hours ago.
It's already gone numb.
You carrying any kind of knife, cutting tool...
maybe in your car?
Not unless you count a nail file.
(half-hearted laugh) I'm afraid that's not gonna do it.
What are we talking about?
You're gonna have to finish amputating my arm.
* (foreboding music) BOBBY: Okay, what's our current status?
About a third of them are semi or unconscious.
Picked up arrhythmia in four, others are coming around.
There's a lot of complaints about headaches and dizziness.
Casualties?
Two so far.
Any word on our ride?
No, it's been 20 minutes since I sent Chimney and John on a bus hunt.
I think it's time we start walking some of these people out of this area.
And what about the seven or so that aren't ambulatory?
I'll stay here with 'em.
Uh-uh.
That's for me to do.
(electricity zapping) (flames roar) Why don't you get these people up, get them ready to move?
This is Nash for Chimney and John.
Have you found us a bus?
Chimney, we need transpo right now.
CHIMNEY: Copy, Skip. Coming in.
(car horn honks) * (honking) * Neither rain nor snow nor heat nor tsunamis stays this couriers from their appointed rounds.
Tell me you didn't steal these mail trucks just so you could say that.
CHIMNEY: Hey, these were the only things that weren't swamped, parked in the PO garages, safe and dry.
Careful.
Okay, everybody in back.
Geary, Forrest, let's load 'em up.
* LAPD. Anybody home?
Hello?
Lord, forgive me.
(glass shatters) (dramatic music) * (Cooper grunts softly) * You weren't specific.
It's bad enough I looted somebody's house.
I wasn't about to come back here with the wrong thing.
Use the shears.
Bone's already broken, so you're just cutting through soft tissue.
Maybe a tendon or two.
Don't say "just." There's nothing "just" about cutting off somebody's arm.
I'd have thought somebody who reached the rank of sergeant would have seen worse than this.
Seen? Yeah.
Contributed?
That's more my husband's domain.
What is he, a doctor?
Fire captain like yourself. Bobby Nash, station 118.
No kidding. What's your name?
Athena. Athena Grant.
Ronnie Cooper, station 136.
You may wanna get started.
This arm's not gonna amputate itself.
That's not funny, Ronnie.
(suspenseful music) Is there somebody you wanna call before we do this?
Your wife?
No, Ellen already knows I'm missing by now.
If something went wrong, it'd be like I died on her twice.
* (gasps) Here. Bite down on this.
* (exhales) * (Cooper moaning) * (moans) * (body tissue squelches) (muffled Cooper yelling) (tense music) * We gotta go!
One minute!
We don't have a minute.
Chimney!
Copy that.
John!
* (ignition turns over) Okay, let's hit it!
* (explosion booming) * Hey, Cap, you all okay back there?
Yeah, we got kissed a bit, but we're fine.
That was way too close.
Wait, watch out!
(tires screech) (dramatic music) We're gonna need a bigger mail truck.
* (coughing, sobbing) It looks like you're gonna have to get used to being a southpaw for the time being.
Best time to work on your change-up and curveball.
(siren whoops) So you a pitcher too?
Class A regional all-star, two years straight.
Naturally. You all fixed up?
All taped up, pain killed, and rarin' to get back out.
You gotta be kidding me.
My captain's still somewhere out there.
And there are already people looking for him.
There's gonna be one more.
Man, you're stubborn.
You can try to stop me, if you wanna know exactly what two broken ribs feels like.
* (siren wails) EDDIE: Hey, Athena.
It's not my blood.
It's his.
Coop?
Ronnie, can you hear me?
Bosko.
(sighs in relief) You're okay.
LENA: Yeah, the crew is too.
(emotional music) (sirens wailing) (dramatic music) * Hey, excuse me. I'm looking for a kid.
He's got brown hair. Chris --Christopher.
How old?
Um, eight, maybe nine.
Christopher Diaz. He has CP.
Christopher Diaz.
No, not here.
You may wanna check over there at the black tent.
* Isn't that the...
The morgue.
Excuse me.
* (somber music) * SUE: Maddie.
That name you had me looking into, Reggie -- Reginald Simmons.
Yeah, Charlie, the girl with the drone, she was just hoping we could locate him.
His body was identified by a recovery crew.
He drowned.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
No, um...it's okay.
(phone buzzing) Thanks. Excuse me.
Hello?
BUCK: Hey, it's me.
Buck? Where are you?
I don't know this number.
I borrowed someone else's phone.
Maddie, I need your help.
Okay, tell me what's wrong. Are you hurt?
BUCK: Eddie dropped Christopher off with me.
He thought, you know, doing some activities with him would get me out of my apartment...
out of my head.
Maddie, I brought him to the pier.
Oh, my God, you were there?
BUCK: And I had him. All right, Mads?
I had him. I kept him safe.
We were --uh...we were on top of the ladder truck, then the water receded...
MADDIE: Okay, you're not answering me.
Are you injured, bleeding?
BUCK: No, it doesn't matter.
Don't you hear what I am saying?
Christopher is gone.
I've checked the emergency refugee camps at the Promenade, at the high school -- Okay, did you check the VA hospital?
The Command Center, you know, on Sawtelle?
I'm here now and he...
(dramatic music) * Oh, God. God, God, no.
MADDIE: What?
(exhales) Eddie's here.
MADDIE: Does he know what happened?
* Evan, you have to tell him.
BUCK: How?
How do you tell your best friend that you lost his son?
No, no, no. He's his father.
Okay, you have to tell him that Christopher's missing.
No, Maddie, I need to keep on looking for him.
I need to find him.
Look, you are in no condition to go looking for Christopher by yourself.
I'm coming down there.
BUCK: No, no.
Maddie! Maddie!
(tense music) * Need some help here!
* Buck? Wait, what are you doing here?
Are you okay? Wait, where's Christopher?
Eddie...
MAN: We need a gurney over here.
Why do you have his glasses?
(solemn music) We, um...
(stammering) me and Christopher, we were...at the beach, and --um...and listen to me, okay?
I swear to you...
okay, I tried...
* And I just...but I...
Eddie, I just don't know how to say it.
He --he just --he...
he just vanished.
Christopher?
Hey.
* EDDIE: Christopher?
CHRISTOPHER: Dad! EDDIE: Oh, my God!
(emotional music) * Thank you. Thank you.
You're Buck?
No, I'm his father, Eddie.
He was looking for Buck.
(exhales) CHIMNEY: Make a hole!
Buck, what happened to you?
* Hey.
* You two okay?
Yeah, we're great.
CHIMNEY: Oh. HEN: Wait, hold up.
(Buck grunts) BOBBY: Come here.
Hang in there. Hang in there, bro.
* (Ed Sheeran's "Photograph") * ED: * Loving can hurt * Loving can hurt sometimes BUCK: There are a lot of ways to be lost at sea.
ED: * Only thing that I know BUCK: It's not the same as being abandoned or stranded.
Those things happen beyond our control.
ED: * Hard, you know it can get hard sometimes * BUCK: Sometimes, we just take a wrong turn too close to the tide.
ED: * It is the only thing BUCK: The waters rise and sweep us away.
ED: * Alive * BUCK: We fight the currents for a way back to dry land and solid ground, to each other...
May, sweetheart.
BUCK: To normal.
Come on, baby, join us.
BUCK: And when we catch our breaths, we search the shore for all the we lost and everything we loved, for our families...
ED: * Holding me closer till our eyes meet * I do.
ED: * You won't ever be alone * BUCK: For our dreams and our futures...
ED: * Wait for me to come home * BUCK: Our friends and loved ones...
* ED: * Loving can mend your soul * BUCK: And for the ones who couldn't swim.
ED: * And it's the only thing You know, there could have been a lot more faces on that wall if it weren't for you.
* ED: * I swear it will get Thanks for being here.
ED: * That with every piece of ya * I'm Big Sister. It's what I do.
ED: * Only thing we take Come here.
ED: * With us when we die *
* When I'm away * I will remember how you kissed * BUCK: Sometimes, being lost is not knowing how to get from where we are to where we wanna be, where we need to be.
ED: * Wait for me to come home * (knock at door) Hey, Buck.
Good morning, Buck.
Hey --hey, buddy.
Okay.
There's a morning snack and midday snack, two coloring books and a bunch of Legos.
Between us, he's never built anything that kinda looks like anything.
He just likes sticking things together.
It's right there, buddy.
There's 20 bucks for pizza, and if I were you, I'd eat a couple extra slices.
You look like you're wasting away to nothing.
Eddie -- EDDIE: I will say, honestly, you being laid up is working out for me.
I mean, you're no abuela, and you're half a Carla, but you'll do in a pinch.
You want me to watch Christopher?
It's easy. He's not very fast.
After everything that happened?
A natural disaster happened, Buck.
I lost him, Eddie.
EDDIE: No, You saved him.
That's how he remembers it.
(tender music) And now, it's his turn to do the same for you.
* I was supposed to look out for him.
And what, you think you failed?
I failed that kid more times than I care to count, and I'm his father.
But I love him enough to never stop trying, and I know you do too.
Buck...there's nobody in this world I trust with my son more than you.
Okay, buddy.
(sighs) I gotta go.
CHRISTOPHER: Ooh.
(Eddie smooches) Love ya, have fun.
Maybe try going to the zoo this time, something inland.
(chuckles softly) Oh, um...
thank you for not giving up.
(door closes) * BUCK: A few choice words can sometimes be the life raft that gets you home.
To be seen...
to be found...
isn't that what we're all searching for?
Hey, Chris.
Oh.
(laughs)
 @@@@@@
(intense music) (sirens wailing) (truck honking) (tires squealing) * MAN: Everyone, please keep moving to the designated safe area.
(fire alarm ringing) * My God, that's the biggest damn fire I've never seen.
* I hate fire drills.
City mandates we do 'em every three years.
Can't fight city hall.
BOBBY: First alarm was triggered at 12:20.
Call came in 30 seconds later.
Boots down, hoses out by 12:43.
That's what?
Four minutes over our allotted response time.
Ouch, that's gonna cost us some points.
HEN: Somebody's gonna have to explain that to the new fire marshal.
BOBBY: There was a stalled bus blocking both directions on Grand.
Vehicles couldn't clear a path, which delayed our arrival.
And yet the 144 managed a response time in under six minutes.
That's a full 17 minutes ahead of the 118.
The 144 is five block away.
I hear you, Bobby, I do, and --and --and I wanna help.
I gotta be impartial here, you know?
Look, if I'm gonna do this kind of light duty, I gotta take it seriously, gotta be strictly by the book, just how you would want me to be.
For what it's worth, I'm proud of you.
I'm glad you didn't throw away your career just 'cause you had a little setback.
I learned one thing from that tsunami: it's that I don't quit. I fight.
I'm gonna keep on fighting until I get back to where I belong: with my team putting out fake fires like this one.
You're enjoying this way too much.
Be careful not to logjam at the stairwells.
I have to -- oh.
MAN: Why do they always do these things during lunch?
My carbonara's gonna turn to mush.
(chuckles) I don't know.
You okay?
It's not a real fire.
You expecting paparazzi?
This is a fake fire. Why can't we use a fake hose?
Hey, Buck, how we doing?
You don't wanna know.
(loud explosions) (ominous music) (music swells) Alan?
Think Alan's having a seizure.
Oh!
(intense music) * (people gasping and moaning) MAN: All right, let's get you up first.
(quirky bass music) HEN: These things are unpredictable.
Epileptic seizures could be triggered by strobing lights, even sounds.
ALAN: I'm just so embarrassed.
HEN: No need to be.
The event seems over.
Just to be safe, we're gonna get you to the hospital, okay?
Thanks.
CHASE: Hey, there.
Chase Mackey, tenth floor, Mackey, Gaskin & Whitmore.
I want you to know I saw everything and I have reason to believe this building is not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
There's several legal options you might wish to consider.
HEN: Sir?
CHASE: Hmm?
You might wanna wait until they're in the ambulance before you start chasing it.
Okay.
BUCK: Well, it's a good thing this wasn't an actual five-alarm fire.
Yeah, that is a good thing.
Probably doesn't help that you're a man down.
You know, I will be sure to mention that in my report.
Thanks.
No problem.
(phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) You've had it twice as long as me.
It's not even your game.
HEN: Denny, let Harry have a turn.
Why can't he play with his own stuff?
Cut it out.
Play nice, or I'll take the game away.
KAREN: We have one more round of tests, and then we do the trigger shot to induce ovulation.
36 hours later, we go in for the egg retrieval.
Doctor's hoping to grab 15.
15 eggs?
(chuckles) I thought you two wanted a baby, not a baseball team.
(laughter) No, we're expected to lose half at every stage of the process, so we start with 15 in the hopes of getting 2 or 3 viable embryos.
Oh, oh, okay.
Well, I've always been an overachiever, so my money's on the baseball team.
(laughter) DENNY: Give it back!
HARRY: It's my turn!
DENNY: It's my game!
HARRY: It's my house!
DENNY: Give it back!
HARRY: It's my turn!
ATHENA: Kids!
(gasps) (slurps) (laughs) You need to teach us how to do that.
(laughter) What if Denny doesn't like having a sibling?
What's not to like?
Kids are better with siblings.
It makes them better people.
Wait a minute. (scoffs) Both Athena and I are only children, and we turned out just fine.
Yes, you are both wonderful adults, but I just --I don't know who I'd be without my brothers.
They made me kinder, more understanding, more willing to share.
Yeah, well, our little one is struggling with the concept of "sharing is caring." What if they're at each other's throats all the time?
ATHENA: Oh, they will be.
Mm-hmm, May, she loved having a baby brother, right up till that part where he started walking and talking and getting into all her stuff.
(chuckles) Oh, I'm not sure we considered that part.
Our family's not just growing; it's changing.
It'll be an adjustment, but you two will do just fine.
Denny'll love having a brother eventually.
(laughter) CHIMNEY: Your brother is driving me crazy.
You weren't there.
Okay, he was enjoying it.
I never seen a man make check marks with such enthusiasm.
Give a guy a little power, he goes mad.
Hmm, said the pot about the kettle.
Hey, Captain Chimney is safely behind us.
I'm a wiser kettle now.
Actually, you were the pot in that scenario.
(plate shatters) (ominous music) Hey.
(gasps) Oh!
What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm fine.
I --I just, um -- I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, just leave it. I'll grab a broom.
No, I got it, okay?
I just --I --I didn't realize, um -- Maddie, are you okay?
I didn't realize how -- that --I didn't realize that it's late, and --and so I should -- I should go.
(door slams) CHIMNEY: Really wasn't sure what to say after that.
"Hey, Maddie, you know I'm nothing "like your psycho ex-husband, right?
I'm not the kind of guy you need to be afraid of." Because she was.
I mean, it was just for a second, but...
she looked scared.
Not really sure what to do with that.
(yawns) Oh, I'm sorry, is my crisis boring you?
Sorry, uh, didn't get much sleep last night.
Christopher's been having nightmares ever since the tsunami.
He and half the city.
That's gotta be expected, though, right?
Ah, he's waking up screaming and crying.
Tried talking to him about it, but he won't open up to me.
Says he's fine.
Yeah, lot of that going around.
HEN: Careful, guys. Hall monitor's here.
BUCK: You guys paint?
Why does the place look smaller?
I think your head just got bigger.
(all chuckle) BOBBY: So Fire Marshal Buck decides to drop off his report in person.
Is that a sign of maturity?
Or is it just revenge for all the times I've written you up?
Actually, uh, you passed.
I bumped up the numbers, got fancy with the math.
You don't know math.
Which will be my excuse if anybody calls me out on it.
Uh, speaking of, did any of you guys get a call from that lawyer?
The ambulance chaser?
He wants to talk to me about the building violations.
Think somebody might be suing them.
Yeah, he was passing out cards like candy.
LENA: Hey, Diaz, I need a spot over here.
Got you.
Hey, good to see you, man.
Uh, who --who's that?
What?
Her name is Lena Bosko.
Her station was smack in the middle of the impact zone and her crew was temporarily reassigned, so I brought her over here.
You replaced me?
What? No.
Then what's that right there?
Buck, relax.
I promise you your place will still be here for you when you're ready.
Cap, I'm ready now.
Buck, listen to me -- (fire alarm rings) We will talk soon.
(fire alarm ringing) (doors slam) (engine turns over) (sirens wailing) (somber music) * CHRISTOPHER (echoing): Dad!
(ominous music) Christopher.
* CHRISTOPHER: She was drowning. She was drowning.
She was drowning. She was drowning.
She was drowning.
EDDIE: Hey.
(gasping) She was drowning. She was drowning.
Oh, it's okay, buddy.
I'm here.
It was just a dream.
It's just a dream.
You're safe.
(ominous musical sting) Has he talked about the tsunami at all?
I'm still not sure what he saw that day.
We're getting there.
Christopher talked about being at the pier with Buck, how they played games.
That part isn't the reason he's waking up every night screaming.
His subconscious is still processing the trauma.
He's working his way through it.
I know it's hard.
You love your son. You wanna fix this.
But it'll take some time.
Just wish he'd talk to me about it.
Maybe he's trying to communicate in other ways.
(tender piano music) * A drowning woman.
Yes, he does seem to be fixated on her.
Lot of people died in that tsunami.
I know Buck tried to shield Chris from most of it, but -- I'm sure your friend did the best he could.
They were separated a long time.
Who knows what else he saw.
Or who this drowning woman was.
He'll tell us when he's ready.
In fact, if the opportunity's right, he might tell you first.
Is there anything I can do until then?
Just keep loving him.
(computer beeps) 911, are you there?
WOMAN: I --I'm --I'm here.
(ominous music) Ma'am, are you all right?
WOMAN: I hear a -- (shakily) I think -- I think I might need -- Are you injured?
WOMAN: No, no, not -- not really. I just -- MAN: Hey, who the hell you on the phone with?
WOMAN: I'm sorry, you've got the wrong number.
(phone clicks) (sighs) (tense music) (computer beeping) * (keyboard clacking) * (computer beeping) (line trilling) MAN: Hello?
(pulsing tense music) MAN (angrily): Hello, who is this?
Uh, good morning, sir.
I'm calling to inform you that starting as low as $49.95, our cleaning service -- MAN: We're not interested.
Take us off your list, and don't call back.
(computer beeps) (dramatic music) * (pounds desk) Multiple calls, multiple hang ups.
Now, according to the call logs, no one ever said anything.
She never said anything until today, and I think that she was about to ask for help but he came back.
Okay, we'll send someone out, do a welfare check.
No, that'll make everything worse.
(sighs) Look, I know that you think this is triggering something personal for me, and...maybe it is.
But it doesn't mean that I'm wrong.
I don't think you're wrong.
You identify with her. You want to help her.
I get it.
But if she's not ready to accept that help...
Yeah, there's nothing we can do.
Been doing this eight years.
I wish I knew the magic words to make someone realize they can get out.
Still haven't found 'em.
But maybe they just don't work over the phone.
911, what's your emergency?
CHASE: So we could agree there was some negligence during this fire drill.
(scoffs) Nah, I wouldn't agree with that, no.
Your after-action report says the LAFD exceeded the evacuation time requirement by 12 minutes.
That's actually a pretty decent time for clearing a 35-story building.
Look, all your questions seem to be about the department.
I thought your client was suing the building.
Clients, 42 injured people the LAFD failed to protect.
This is a class action against the city on all of their behalfs.
You're suing the city?
Mm-hmm.
And you think I'm gonna help you with that?
I find disgruntled employees often make the best witnesses.
Uh, I'm --I'm not disgruntled.
I looked into you.
I know about the accident, how you've been fighting with the LAFD to return to full duty because of the blood thinners.
They're just trying to protect the department.
And who's protecting you?
Yeah, I can take care of myself.
Watch.
You know, the city that you're trying to make look bad is not some corporation.
Those city employees, those firefighters that you can't wait to smear, are heroes, so you wanna know who's got my back?
They do.
See, there' more than coworkers or friends.
They're my family.
There's nothing stronger than family.
(upbeat music) CAMDEN: Don't touch me, scuzzbag.
JESSE: You're the scuzzbag, tool!
CAMDEN: Nobody likes you at school.
Ma, he's doing it again.
Camden, I told you not to say things like that about your brother.
CAMDEN: I can't help it if it's true.
JESSE: Mom!
Jesse, there's nothing I can do right now.
There's never anything you can do.
Ow, quit it!
Mom!
Camden.
CAMDEN: I'm not doing anything. He's lying.
JESSE: I'm not lying. You're lying.
(tires squealing) JUDY: Don't make me have to stop this car.
CAMDEN: Mom, he was asking for it.
JESSE: No, I'm not. You're just a big, fat jerk.
(horn honking) Stop!
Here's two for flinching.
Mom!
Camden, I am not gonna warn you again!
You understand what I'm saying?
BOTH: Mom!
Oh, my God!
(horn honks) (tires squeal) (boys laughing) Why are you laughing?
It's not funny!
You shoulda seen your face.
JESSE: She was all like, "Ah!" (all laugh) Oh, so now you're on the same side.
Fine. (laughs) Whoa!
CAMDEN (whispering): The road is gone.
(dramatic music swells) * Driver's name is Judith Spivey.
She and her two sons are trapped inside the vehicle.
Mom's unconscious, but the kids seem to be okay.
It looks like they tumbled a bit before catching on the brush.
We better get to work before we lose any more ground.
Eddie, set up the winch.
Lena, I want you to get down there and anchor that vehicle.
Take it slow.
Too much weight and this cliffside can come down.
We don't want that car to go along with it.
(tense music) Hey, Cap, I'm worried about the mom.
Maybe the crash just knocked her out, but she's still not awake.
All right, harness up.
* (intense music) * CHIMNEY: Guys, I'll be right with you.
I'm gonna check on your mother.
* (wind howling) * Cap, pulse is steady, but she's out like a light.
We're gonna need the basket.
On it, Cap.
(radio beeps) How the kids doing?
Terrified.
LENA: Hey, I'm Lena.
What are your names?
I'm Camden.
He's Jesse.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
The car started shifting!
Get clear!
(line clangs) (metal creaking) (wind howling) (boys scream) (glass shatters) (intense music) Lena, Chim, what's your status?
LENA: All good, Cap.
CHIMNEY: All good, Cap.
The damn car dropped another 20 feet.
BOBBY: Ground's too soft. It's not gonna hold.
Hop in the cab.
Be prepared to bug out of here if this thing goes south.
We need to clear that ambulance and all nonessential equipment, pull back as much weight as we can from this cliffside now.
(dramatic music) * You guys okay?
(truck horn honks) That's our signal to move.
Camden, we're gonna -- Take Jesse first.
I'm not leaving mom.
I'm not leaving you.
Jesse, listen to me.
You need to go with her.
I'll be right behind you.
It's gonna be okay.
Go now.
LENA: Come on, Jesse. Grab onto me.
Passengers secured. Green light.
Copy. Bring him up.
(intense music) * CHIMNEY: Cap, we gotta get the mom up.
Is she dead?
No, Camden, she's not dead.
Good, Jesse's only nine.
He's too little to not have a mom.
(tender piano music) (car creaking) (sighs) * All right, how 'bout we make a deal?
You do exactly what I tell, I get you both out of here, and no one loses their mom today.
* HEN: Hey, let me take a look at you.
(radio beeps) Lena is coming down with the basket.
Hey, Bosko, hold the basket steady while I get Mom in it.
Here we go.
One, two, three!
Cam, stay with me.
Your mom's gonna be good.
All right, Lena, she's all yours.
(suspenseful music) Come on, kid, you're riding with me.
* Come on, kid, you're riding with me.
Okay?
Yeah.
BOBBY: Okay, get her loaded up.
(rocks clatter) EDDIE: Cap, we're running out of time.
Get ready to cut her loose.
(rocks clattering) Chim, you gotta move.
CHIMNEY (over radio): Get us out of here, Cap.
Green, green, green!
Now.
(metal clanging) (glass smashing) Safe and sound.
BOBBY: Cutting it kinda close there.
I wanted to make an entrance.
JESSE: Cam!
(gasps) LAFD, ma'am. You were in an accident.
(moans) We're gonna take you to the hospital now to be checked out, okay?
(weakly) But my -- I've got --I've got kids.
(sentimental music) They're taking care of each other.
* I looked for priors on that name you gave me, Vincent Dagastino.
Couple D&Ds, drunk and disorderly, a few years back.
Uh, one speeding violation about five years ago.
So no arrests for battery, assault, anything violent?
ATHENA: Nothing that made it into his record.
I mean, if you're not sure, I could, um -- I could do a little more digging, call some friends.
MADDIE: No, that's okay.
I'm not really sure about anything.
I feel like maybe I'm chasing shadows here.
(insects chirping) Um, but thanks for your help.
ATHENA: Anytime.
Uh, yeah, I really appreciate it.
(death metal blaring from radio) Bye.
ATHENA: Bye.
(loud death metal continues) (sighs) (tense music) * MAN: Hey, I'm home. What's for dinner?
(timer beeps) ATHENA: Mmm, mmm, do I smell candied yams?
I still can't believe that you invited him without talking to me first.
I just wanted him to know that no matter what, he's still family.
Thought dinner would give you two time to work things out.
Athena, I didn't tell him.
I thought you said he came by the firehouse.
He did, but then we had to go out on a call.
(doorbell rings) I'll get the door.
Hmm.
I'll get the wine.
(chuckles) BUCK: So I told that lawyer off big-time.
You know, I said, "You're not gonna get me to sign any affidavit that blames the 118 for anything." Appreciate that.
BUCK: Please, the nerve of that guy to think I would turn on my friends? Uh-uh.
(chuckles) Whew, I missed your cooking, Cap.
Well, I miss your eating.
Never have to worry about leftovers.
Collard greens?
Oh, no, not for me.
Uh, I can't eat those, not while I'm on the blood thinners.
Too much vitamin K.
Oh, it sounds like you're taking your health very seriously.
I figure the better I manage this, the sooner I can go back to work.
That's very mature of you, Buck.
BUCK: Thank you.
Hey, that --that lawyer, uh, he did get me thinking.
There's strength in numbers, right?
Maybe I could get everyone to sign a statement of support or something, show the higher-ups that --that you guys don't think I'm liability.
Buck -- They'd have to listen, right?
I want you to listen to me.
BUCK: If you told them that I was ready, I mean, these --these dumbasses, they would --they would have no right to keep me -- I'm the dumbass.
Uh, what?
You're not ready.
That's what I told them when they asked.
Would anybody like any corn bread?
BOBBY: Thank you.
You're the reason they won't let me back?
The medication is the reason.
Bobby is just worried about you, Buck, that's all.
We all are.
I thought you were on my side.
I thought you were my friend.
I am your friend.
I am also the captain of almost 20 other firefighters whose lives and safety depend on decisions I make, and I can't put them at risk.
If you're not operating at 100%-- (pounding table) I am at 100%!
I -- May --maybe even more, you know?
I --I --I've never f -- felt so good.
Buck, I know that you went through a lot in that tsunami and maybe you feel like you can survive anything.
Anything.
Like a knife in my back.
Um, Athena, I just wanna say thank you for inviting me.
I'm sorry. I --I --I --I gotta go.
BOBBY: Okay, Buck, hold on.
ATHENA: You don't have to leave.
BOBBY: Buck.
(somber music) * (dramatic musical sting) (insects chirping) (woman shouting indistinctly) TARA: You have to listen to me.
He's just a friend.
(glass shatters) (ominous music) VINCENT: Tell me the truth, damn it!
Don't make me do something you'll regret.
TARA: That is it, Vincent! That's it!
VINCENT: You really think I'm gonna believe that?
TARA: Yes!
VINCENT: Get over here!
TARA: No, no, Vincent, stop, stop!
Just let me go!
Vincent, where are you going?
VINCENT: I just told you!
I'm getting something out of the car.
(ominous music) * (engine turns over) (tires squealing) Watch where you're going, moron!
(crying) (dramatic music swells) CHASE: If you go down this road, I need you to know suing the city is not a small matter.
Look, all I want is my job back.
But if you don't win, not only will you never work as a firefighter in Los Angeles again, I doubt any department in the country will hire you.
(tense music) They'll see me as a...
a squeaky wheel.
Or worse.
You see, once a potential employer perceives you as litigious liability, it is impossible to unring that bell.
Not if I win.
Then I'm back with the 118, a --a firefighter.
You should also be aware that during this process, it's best to have no contact with anyone from or tangentially connected to your station house.
That means no texts, no calls, nothing that could compromise our case.
(somber music) I'm not sure we have much to say to each other right now anyway.
* I'm alone in this fight.
LENA: "Keep loving him." Did he write that on a prescription pad?
Doesn't sound like you're a fan.
Hands up.
(sighs) The headshrinkers have their place.
It's a very touchy-feely place, but that works for some people.
Oh, not you?
I went to one once...
When I was a kid after my dad died.
This lady had hand puppets.
(scoffs) Did that help?
I made her cry, and then I told my mom I didn't wanna go back.
Oh, great, I feel encouraged.
Look, everyone deals with trauma differently.
I don't know your kid, but I know what worked for me.
It was when my mom told me how she was feeling, that she was sad and that it was okay.
However we felt, we were in it together, no matter what.
Sounds like good advice.
She's a good mom.
(Jimmy Buffett's "Margaritaville" playing) CYNN: You bitch.
MOIRA: Who are you calling a bitch?
CYNN: Who do you think, bitch?
You said that we were gonna sell all of Mom's stuff and we were gonna split the profits 50/50.
I'm sorry, it's not as easy for me as it is for you.
I told you, you can't be overly sentimental.
It's just things.
I know. I'm trying.
You're trying?
Yeah.
What about the lamp?
I was the one who gave that to her.
You know what?
If you wanna walk around and just pick up all the cheap crap you bought her, go right ahead.
Oh, that filled with vodka got Mom through her book club meetings.
She loved that cup.
I'm sure she did.
What the hell are you doing over there anyway?
Are you gonna help me with this or not?
I'm making margaritas.
You didn't think I was gonna get through this little reunion of ours sober, did you?
You know what? I bought her this blender too.
Oh, my God, why is everything a competition with you?
(blender whirs) What?
I said -- (blender pulses) I'm sorry, what?
Okay, are you gonna -- (blender whirring) Are you gonna offer me some of that?
I guess.
But try not to get too hammered.
I don't need you puking all over Mom's house.
I was 14 years old.
Why do you always bring that up?
Because somehow I was the one who got grounded.
Oh, yum.
You know, actually, I could use a blender.
Haven't you gotten enough?
You still pissed about the ring?
Of course I'm upset.
The favorite daughter gets the family heirloom, the one -- (sighs) That should have been mine, but she left it to you, so...
No, you can't have the blender.
Hold on. Why should you have gotten the ring?
She bought you a condo.
That was a loan, and I paid her back with interest.
Of course you did.
Yes.
'Cause you're Little Miss Perfect and I'm the screwup. You know what?
This was Mom's apology, and I'm accepting it.
(Jimmy Buffett's "Margaritaville" continues) Just promise me that you won't let anything happen to it, okay?
* That you keep it in the family.
(cheerful tropical music playing) * (sighs) For safekeeping.
Okay?
* Hey.
To mom.
* I blew out my flip-flop *
* Stepped on a pop-top CYNN: (snoring) * Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home * (snoring) * But there's booze in the blender *
* And soon it will render * That frozen concoction that helps me hang on *
* * Wastin' away again in Margarita -- * The thief is out here.
BOBBY: Thief? I'm sorry.
Uh, dispatch said it was a medical emergency.
CYNN: It's both.
(dramatic musical sting) Why is this happening?
Divine retribution, Moira.
HEN: Hmm, or more likely, it's an allergic reaction.
BOBBY: All right, ma'am, is there anything in the house that you're sensitive to, medications, foods?
She used to break out in hives when she was stressed.
I'm not stressed?
Our mom just died, so I'm --I'm a little stressed.
Stress wouldn't do this.
Which one of you played bartender?
I did, why?
Phytophotodermatitis, it's a fancy name for margarita burns.
Citrus over a certain temperature and UV light conditions can trigger a chemical reaction.
Ma'am, this ring finger, can you feel it?
No.
HEN: An Epi should bring down the swelling, but we're gonna have to cut this ring off.
No! Uh-uh! No! You cannot cut that ring.
That is my ring, and I do not give you authorization to cut it.
Your sister's finger is turning blue.
That's the step before black, when it's dead.
Her whole finger could fall off.
That sounds horrible.
Can't you just cut the finger off now before that happens?
BOBBY: Ma'am, I understand that it's a sentimental object, so we'll save you the pieces.
I'm gonna give you the shot.
Oh! (gasps) BOBBY: All right, hold still.
(saw whirring) Wait!
I sold it.
The buyer's already paid me a lot.
MOIRA: I knew it.
You are, without a doubt, the worst person...
Hey, hey, hey.
I have ever known!
Come on, aren't you sisters mourning your deceased mother?
Aren't you supposed to be teaching each other empathy instead of setting each other off?
Only child, right?
Obviously.
BOBBY: Okay, just hold still.
(saw whirring) Okay, Hen.
(ring snaps) All right.
(ponderous music) * Remember, sharing is caring.
JOAN JETT: * I hate myself for loving you *
* Can't break free from the things that you do *
* I wanna walk, but I...
MADDIE: Excuse me.
Do you know how this works?
(laughs) Yeah, it's, uh, not very intuitive, but once you know all the routines, it's really easy.
I could show you.
Oh, no, I wouldn't want to put you out.
Oh, it's no trouble. I'm a trainer.
Of course you are. I'm sorry. I'm new. I -- I'm Tara.
Maddie.
Um, do you, by any chance, have any openings in your schedule?
Actually, I'm free right now.
So is the first session.
Oh, okay, well, why not?
Let's get you started on...the treadmill, get you warmed up.
Awesome.
Okay, I'm already sore.
(both laugh) Well, that's scientifically impossible, but if you get that recovery drink I recommended, that should help.
I will.
Thanks.
So we're on again for next Thursday night?
Are you sure 9:00 isn't too late?
I do shift work, so I'm used to the crazy hours.
(phone buzzes) MADDIE: Ah.
So what do you do?
I'm a nurse.
(car honking frantically) Look like my ride's here.
(ominous music) * Maddie, this is my husband, Vincent.
* Nice to meet you.
* You too, Vincent.
* Maddie's a --a new client of mine.
* We're gonna get stronger together, right, Maddie?
Yeah.
TARA: See you next Thursday.
(car door slams) * (elevator dings) (curious music) * Wow, this is a surprise.
What are you doing here?
Hey.
Thought I'd try and catch you before you started your shift.
I wanted to talk to you about the other day, the plate or what happened after the plate.
Oh, that was nothing. You just -- you startled me, that's all.
Uh...
It wasn't nothing, Maddie.
Not exactly sure what to call it. Uh...
Okay, I swear it had nothing to do with you.
I know.
At first, I didn't, but we had this call today...
uh, yesterday, I guess.
This car fell off the cliff Oh, yeah, I heard about that, the mom and her two kids, right?
Yeah.
Well, the older kid, he was probably 12 or 13.
I could see him trying to be strong for his brother and his mother, and it just took me back to when I was a kid trying to be strong for my mother while some doctor explains cancer to us, and it just triggered all these emotions in me.
You never told me about that.
Well, I had never really thought about that in years, but all of a sudden, there it was.
You know, I didn't plan it, couldn't control it.
It just happened.
There's gotta be a word for that.
I'm sure the Germans have something.
It's probably 27 syllables long and completely unpronounceable, but whatever it is, it's a part of us, who we are, and I just never want you to ever feel like you have to hide that from me.
Okay.
(tender music) No more hiding.
* Okay.
I'm gonna call you later.
Can't wait.
* (gentle music) * (timer beeping) (whispers) Hey.
(whispers) Hey, you awake?
It's time for the shot.
Oh.
You could flirt with a girl a little before you knock her up.
(chuckles softly) It's also a beneficial activity when trying to induce pregnancy.
* Are we still doing this?
This is not just about what I want.
It's about what we want.
When I was a little girl, I was lonely.
Not all the time, but after my dad left and my mom was working two jobs, I felt very alone in the world.
* I don't want Denny to feel that way.
He may not like the idea of a sibling right now, but there'll also be wonderful times filled with love.
Hell, they can commiserate about their crazy mothers.
(both laugh) They'll never be bored.
No. (chuckles) I'm ready if you are.
Ah!
Bah!
Tuck these feetsies in.
Okay.
Let me see those pearly whites.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, very pearly.
Good job.
Hey, buddy, you know if there's anything bothering you, you can talk to me. You know that, right?
I know, Daddy.
(tender music) * Love you. Good night.
(sighs) * (sentimental music) (papers rustling) * Christopher.
Is this Mom?
Hey.
Is that who you've been dreaming about?
Why didn't you tell me?
(whispers) I don't wanna make you sad.
EDDIE: Oh, my.
Hey, hey.
There's nothing wrong with being sad.
I loved your mom and I miss her, probably always will.
But...
we still got each other, which means we're gonna be okay.
(whispers) Okay.
Okay.
* I love you, Daddy.
* (doorbell rings) Buck, is everything all right?
I'm sorry to come by so late.
ATHENA: Who is it?
It's Buck.
BUCK: Just wanted to apologize to the both of you for walking out on dinner.
ATHENA: Oh, things just got a little heated.
No need to apologize.
Why don't you come on in?
BOBBY: Yeah.
Sorry, I can't do that.
Uh, this will be the last time we can talk for a while.
Buck, what is going on?
(ominous music) * I thought you should hear it from me.
I figured I should be the one to deliver this.
I'm suing the city, the department, and you for wrongful termination.
Come again?
I told you I wouldn't stop fighting until I got my job back, and I won't...
Even if it means fighting you.
 @@@@@@
(The Pretenders' "Precious") (people screaming, laughing) (grunts) A rage room? Denise, this is silly.
Come on, it'll be fun.
We get to smash a bunch of junk.
I don't know.
Oh, Emily.
We are doing this.
When is the last time you allowed yourself to feel angry?
I mean, really angry. Never.
Even after Eric asked you for the divorce.
Just think of his face every time you smash something to pieces.
Okay, I'm in.
(bell rings) (glass shattering) Hm.
Shall we?
(bell ringing) (grunts) Whoo! You're up!
I don't think this is working.
Come on! You gotta reach down deep and find your rage!
(laughs) Okay.
Remember when you made that big anniversary dinner and Eric didn't even show up?
Didn't that piss you off?
Yes, I spent $400 on a sous-vide and boiled meat in a plastic bag.
Yeah, you did.
Oh. Okay.
That a girl!
What about the time when he took that boys' trip up in Big Bear and he left you home alone with a sick two-year-old?
I was covered in puke and poop and he was at a ski lodge sipping bourbon and smoking cigars!
And what about that thing he does where he barks like a seal when he's having sex?
I mean, what is that about?
I never told you about that.
Sure, you did. Ahh -- I mean, you must have. You tell me everything.
Oh, my God.
I knew there was someone else.
And it was you!
No, no, it's --it's not.
(screams) I mean, not recently.
You're supposed to be my best friend!
(screams) (grunting) (screaming) (whimpering) EMILY: (screaming) I'm sorry, I can't hear you. What is that noise?
DENISE: Friend! I've unleashed a monster.
She's gonna kill me.
Ma'am, can you tell me where you're calling from?
DENISE: Happy's Rage Room, downtown!
HEN: Apart from a blowout bar, this is the dumbest thing people in L. A. pay money for.
I think it's genius.
Your victim's in there.
Where?
(sighs) There. Your victim climbed into the barrel after her BFF started chasing her with a sledgehammer.
I thought the point was to smash things, not each other.
Wife. Mistress.
Adulterous slut!
Does the adulterous slut have a name?
Denise. She can't hear you very well in there.
Ears ringing.
BOBBY: Denise, are you hurt?
DENISE: What?
Ah, looks like she's sledge hammered in there pretty good, Cap.
Lena, Eddie, saws and jaws.
On it, Cap.
Denise, we're gonna cut you out of there.
DENISE: What?
(saw whirring) (dramatic music) * (metal groaning) You have the right to remain silent.
Wait, excuse me. Please, don't arrest her.
This is all my fault.
You wanna be a better friend? Bail her out.
I'd rather rot in jail than have her do another thing for me.
EMILY: I should've never trusted you!
Consider this the end of our friendship!
I hate you! Next time -- So much anger in the world these days.
I can see why this place is all the rage.
See what I did there?
(scoffs) Oh, I see it.
(laughter) (phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) I'm really sorry about this.
I thought I was gonna have the day off.
Oh, it's fine.
Pretty sure I'm gonna have an easier day than you are.
(chuckles) A root canal would be more fun.
(chuckles) (phone chimes) (gasps) Six -- Six embryos made it.
They're sending them for testing, and then -- HEN: We can schedule the transfer.
(both laugh) I guess we have to start deciding exactly how many little pairs of feet we want stomping around this house.
(both laugh) Mom, have you seen my phone charger?
Why am I the lost and found?
In the kitchen. Next to the coffee maker.
And hurry! Let's go!
What time are you and Bobby leaving?
We're not.
What? I thought you guys were going to that B&B up the coast.
Canceled, on account of a lawsuit.
Buck's suing the city to get his job back.
Bobby has to go in for an arbitration hearing today.
Wow. Last time I saw Buck he was coughing up blood on the patio.
Oh, yeah. He's a sweet kid, but I need to stop inviting him over.
Chaos inevitably ensues.
That sounds like a great idea.
None of this would've happened if you hadn't invited him over for dinner.
Excuse you.
And that would be my cue.
Hey, Harry! Come on, let's go, man!
You know your grandmother's expecting us for lunch.
And if we're late, I am definitely blaming you.
It won't matter. It's genetically impossible for GG to get mad at me.
(laughs) Bye, Bobby.
You two be good.
Don't give your dad too much trouble.
Give GG a kiss hello for me.
I will.
Have fun!
* So, what is that about this Buck thing being my fault?
I think I'll exercise my right to remain silent.
I love you.
(laughs) ARBITRATOR: This is not a trial, and I am not a judge.
This arbitration will address Mr. Buckley's claim against the Los Angeles Fire Department for wrongful termination.
Buck wasn't terminated. He still has his job.
CHASE: It's our position that Firefighter Buckley, while not technically fired, has been constructively terminated from all components of firefighting duty.
A defacto firing.
Which is a direct result of a pattern of discriminatory and unequal treatment on the part of Captain Nash.
Unequal treatment?
I don't treat Buck any differently than I do any other firefighter under my watch.
Really?
Really.
See, I was hit from behind with a construction truck and the rebar entered the back of my skull and went right through my brain and exited my forehead.
See that little scar?
Yeah.
It's all I ended up with.
That's miraculous.
And how long did it take before you returned to work?
Uh...
several weeks.
No, you know what? It was more closer to a month.
I'm a quick healer, evidently.
CHASE: Evidently.
And your more recent medical trauma -- after you were stabbed repeatedly by your girlfriend's ex-husband -- How long before you were back with the 118?
That was also about a month.
CHASE: Hm. So it's fair to say Captain Nash has followed a pattern of allowing firefighters with serious injuries back after less than a month.
No, I don't think it is fair to say.
Every patient is different. Every injury is different.
The blood thinners that Buck has to take right now makes it very dangerous for him to be in the field.
Tell me...
do you recognize this brochure?
Yes.
Can you tell us what it is?
HEN: It's a commercial brochure for anticoagulant blood thinner medication.
Medications that you yourself sold in your former career as a pharmaceutical rep.
Is that right?
Yes.
And in your sales pitch to your doctor clients, was it your contention that these medications would allow patients to resume their normal lives?
I was a sales rep, not a doctor.
But you were a field medic.
Doesn't qualify me to comment on Buck's medical status.
It does make me understand the chain of command.
And if Cap says he's not ready, he's not ready.
Were you ready, Firefighter Diaz, to return to work after your wife's death?
That's my business.
CHASE: It's also your Captain's business.
He never suggested you take some time?
See a counselor?
He wasn't there at the time.
'Cause he'd been suspended.
Captain Nash's suspension was adjudicated.
I don't see how it is relevant to this proceeding.
It's relevant because it illustrates how everyone except Mr. Buckley is allowed to return to the job, no matter the injury or infraction.
Buck has a chronic medical condition.
And what about your own chronic medical condition, Captain Nash?
I believe the National Institute of Health classifies alcoholism as a chronic brain disease.
I'm clean and sober.
You are now, and you were before.
But isn't it true that just about a year and a half ago, you did have a relapse?
I did.
After the Liberty jet crash, I drank.
I was not on duty.
But it was you and Mr. Buckley who found Bobby passed out in his apartment.
Yes.
That happened.
I did not know about that.
That was before I got here.
You asked my client for his help that day.
That's exactly what he did, without hesitation.
He helped you get sobered up, and then you returned to your full duties as captain of the 118.
Yes, that's all true.
So isn't the only difference between your off-duty relapse and Mr. Buckley's is that he actually did everything in his power to help you return to your job.
CHASE: Well, I thought that went great.
I'll let you know what I hear. Okay? You did good.
* CLAIRE: Come on, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
We're here at the McDouglas duck farm where countless innocent duck lives are being snuffed out on a daily basis.
If the law won't shut 'em down, we will.
If you want to support our mission, please, go to our website.
Get mad!
TOBY: We're right here. We're here for you guys.
We're coming.
(ducks quacking) We're here in the slaughterhouse where these defenseless will get clamp to these hooks and conveyed to their deaths.
Mechanized murder!
Not on our watch.
(metal clanging) CLAIRE: Over there. Under the machine. Let's go.
The hell are you people doing here?
Exercising our First Amendment right to protest.
Like hell.
You're trespassing!
We're making sure no more innocent ducks die today.
Oh, don't do that!
Don't do that!
Rage against the cage.
ALL: Rage against the cage! Rage against the cage!
Rage against the cage!
Hey, hey, hey!
ALL: Rage against the cage!
Oh, no, no, no! Now that's just vandalism.
(alarm blares) CLAIRE: Oh, my God!
Oh, crap.
CLAIRE: Oh, my God! Turn it off! Turn it off!
Turn it off!
(screaming) (shouting) CLAIRE: Turn it off!
Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!
(choking) The damn fools locked themselves to the belt and the motor got kicked on.
Now it seems to be stuck.
BOBBY: Can you cut the power?
RICK: I do that, I got 1,400 duck carcasses starting to rot.
Toby, where is the key to your lock?
I can't find it.
I swallowed it.
You swallowed it?
We didn't say anything about swallowing the keys!
Oh, you withheld information from your team.
How's that working out for you?
Lena, bolt cutters!
Sir, try not to struggle.
Coming in hot!
(grunts, coughing) I got some bruising, possible swelling of the trachea.
We're gonna get you to the hospital.
They'll check you out there.
I'm fine. I don't need to go to the hospital.
He needs to go to jail.
(machinery winds down) Hey, did you just shut that off?
So?
So you could've done that the whole time, and you just let it run?
Ah, man, they were trespass -- They're just idiot kids! They could've died!
Bobby!
(coughing) It's gotta be that key. Keep coughing, buddy.
HEN: Toby? Toby? What's wrong?
Starting the Heimlich!
He's not breathing.
All right, get him on a backboard, now! Let's go!
Ready?
CLAIRE: Something's not right.
Toby? He's not -- He's dying.
HEN: I got a pulse.
CHIMNEY: Let's ventilate.
CLAIRE: Oh, I'm scared. I'm scared, Toby.
He's dying, guys. This is not -- (coughing) The key must've torn his trachea.
We gotta try to get it out.
CHIMNEY: Lena, my bag. Magill forceps.
Oh, God. Please don't let him die on my property.
* CLAIRE: (breathing heavily) Oh.
HEN: Stable.
CLAIRE: Oh!
He never told me he was gonna eat that key.
HEN: He's still not breathing.
Two more rescue breaths.
* Chest is rising.
He's breathing.
You still wanna press charges?
I think we're good.
CHIMNEY: All right, let's get him on a gurney, on three.
NICK: * I'm a sucker for you * You know, I thought that we agreed to be technology free on this trip.
We just passed L. A. city limit.
Oh, God.
(laughs) Could you at least check on your brother and make sure he's still breathing.
I think he's in a food coma from GG's cooking.
Ohh, that's the only way to go.
(both laugh) Ooh!
Mm, call your mother and tell her we'll be home in about half an hour.
Okay.
(siren chirps, horn blares) Or not.
(siren continues) Come on!
(radio chatter) * Hey.
License and registration.
It's in the glove box. You mind if I reach for it?
All right.
(opens glove box) All right. Here you go.
This your car?
It's on the paperwork.
Step out of the car, sir.
What? Why?
Ah, it's fine, baby.
Sit tight.
Where you coming from?
Visiting my mother.
Do you mind if I ask why you pulled me over?
Expired tags.
Wait here while I run your information.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait. I --I actually have the tags in my car -- Don't move.
Turn around, put your hands on the hood and wait here while I run your plates.
Excuse me? Hold on for a second.
I said don't move!
Oh! Okay, okay, okay!
Hands on the hood!
(phone beeps) REYNOLDS: Our friend here is having trouble listening to directions.
Please, miss.
What are you doing to my dad?
Get back in the vehicle.
May, get back in the car!
Do what he says.
No, they can't just treat us like this.
REYNOLDS: Take her phone.
Stop.
Back seat!
No, no, no!
Dad!
Hands in the air!
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
No!
Hands in the -- Get off me!
(all shouting) Back in the car, now!
Do not move!
Please don't shoot my son! Don't you shoot my son!
Look, my wife is a sergeant.
Her name is Athena Grant. LAPD.
Please.
* (somber music) * It's just a kid.
Come here. Come here, come here, come here.
Okay. It's okay. Harry, sit tight, man.
REYNOLDS: It's all good. You got this.
Yeah.
You folks have a nice night, then.
* Come on.
Come here, man. Ahh.
Ahh, okay. We're good.
MICHAEL: We're good. You get in the car, now.
Let's go. Let's go, yeah? All right.
* (engine starts) (siren chirps) * Shoot first, and then ask questions later.
That's how they're trained.
But they didn't fire their weapons, thank God.
All right? It was just a bad stop. They happen.
They pulled their guns, Athena.
It wasn't just a bad stop.
We will file a complaint. There will be an investigation.
And what do you think the determination will be of that?
Let me save you the paperwork.
We'd be lucky for a slap on the wrist.
Is Dad gonna get arrested?
What? No, man. Come here.
Hey, listen, my man.
Daddy's not going anywhere. It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
They could've killed Harry, and they could've killed you.
May. Please, now.
What? It's the truth.
Why do they do that to us?
'Cause they were afraid, honey. And they overreacted.
They were afraid because they saw me as a big, scary black man.
Well, arguing with the police probably wasn't the best choice.
Wait a minute. Are you blaming me for this?
No.
Well, you're giving them the benefit of the doubt.
Because I am them!
Right.
All right, I know what it's like.
You're walking up to a car, all right?
You're out in the open, exposed.
You don't know what's waiting for you when you walk up to that window.
It's a father and his two kids.
So you don't think that maybe that was the moment that they should've stood down?
Yes! All right?
And the idea of what could've happened terrifies me.
So it's not as simple as pick a side.
How can you be a cop when they treat black people like this?
It is not all cops, May.
The good outnumber the bad.
Not when the good choose to look the other way when the bad do stuff like this.
No one is looking the other way.
Really? Because those cops will go home tonight and they'll probably sleep easy.
Business as usual for them.
But our son and daughter are sitting here, traumatized.
You know what?
They're not gonna forget what they did to us, okay?
I have it all on my cell phone. I'm posting the video.
You will not.
We do not need that kind of attention.
This family doesn't.
You and Harry's face online, just forever associated with that incident.
I do not want that for you.
You're right, you're right, you're right.
Your mother -- your mother's right.
Besides, nobody got shot, right?
Probably wouldn't get that much of a reaction anyway.
Michael, the police are not the enemy.
All right? It's not us versus them.
I do not wanna teach our kids that.
Then tell your colleagues that.
Because that's how I felt when they pulled a gun out on our son!
(sighs) Okay, bud.
Let's go.
All right, strong legs. There we go.
Are you sure about this?
I'm gonna have Carla pick you up after the party.
No, Dad. I --I wanna go.
Hey, guys! You made it!
Dillon is so excited!
Maybe now he'll stop talking about it.
Wait, who am I kidding? No, he won't.
(laughs) You got my emails, right?
I did. Very detailed.
All right. Be good, have fun.
Call me if you need anything, okay?
Okay, Dad. I love you.
I love you too, kid.
All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
(laughing) Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
He's going to be okay, Eddie.
EDDIE: I know. He hasn't had a nightmare in a week.
The doctor says a sleepover will be great for him.
I'm not sure how good it's gonna be for me.
Listen, don't worry.
Dillon's got this whole camping situation set up in the backyard, and Ron'll be in the tent next to them.
Okay, we'll call you if there's any problem.
Now, go relax. Recharge.
I will return him to you in one piece tomorrow.
Thanks, Tasha.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, that's a handicapped spot.
I know.
Oh, you know.
(laughs) Oh, that's rich.
I had knee surgery and had to park three rows in, but, uh, look at you.
Must be nice to own the world.
Look, I'm not doing this with you, man.
My kid has CP, and I just dropped him off.
Yeah, I'm sure. Like those guys that put dummies in their passenger seats so they can use the carpool lane.
Did you just insult my kid?
I ain't insulting anybody.
I'm calling you out.
You got something to say about that?
(siren wails) (gate buzzing) Thanks for coming to bail me out.
I was surprised to get your call.
I didn't realize we reached the bail each other out of jail phase of our friendship.
EDDIE: Well, there's no way I was gonna call my abuela or the 118, and I'm not allowed to talk to Buck.
Look, I don't mind the bailing, but I'm a little concerned about the jailing part.
I guess I just snapped.
You punched a handicapped guy.
He wasn't handicapped.
He had a bad -- he had a bad knee, there's a difference.
It won't happen again.
Lesson learned.
Hope so.
I also hope this guy doesn't have a lawyer.
* (knocking) Yeah, I got a client meeting. I'll call you back.
Boy, you got here fast.
Hope you didn't break any laws on the way here.
Though, I do know someone.
You, uh, you said you had big news?
The biggest.
Uh, what --what is this?
That is the city's offer.
They wanna settle. Now, it's only a jumping off point.
We can counter.
Th --this is all they're offering?
(laughs) Did I, uh -- did I forget a zero?
No, I got it right.
You do understand they're offering you millions of dollars.
I don't want millions.
I --I want my job back.
That was the whole point in us doing this.
But you'd be a millionaire. Congratulations.
You never have to have a job again.
Yeah, I didn't do this for money.
I did this so that I could go back to doing what I love.
To be back with my team.
(chuckles) Uh, you really think they're gonna welcome you back, kid?
I mean, not to toot my own horn, but I raked your friends over the coals pretty hard.
Wait, I told you that stuff, not so that you would use it, it was just information.
What happened to attorney-client privilege?
Okay, that doesn't work how you think it does.
But I did exactly what you asked me to do.
We won. Maybe not how you wanted, but -- Well, this doesn't feel like winning.
But it's probably as close as you're ever gonna get.
So what do you wanna do?
MAY: What are you doing to my dad?
MARTIN: Miss, get back in the vehicle.
MICHAEL May, get back in the car.
Okay, do what he says.
MAY: No, they can't just treat us like this.
REYNOLDS: Take her phone.
MAY: No.
MARTIN: Back seat.
MAY: No, no, stop!
MARTIN: Hands in the air!
(shouting, struggling efforts) MAY: Stop! Stop!
MARTIN: Get back in the car, now!
MAY: Leave us alone!
MICHAEL: Don't shoot my son!
Don't you shoot my son!
Look, my wife is a sergeant. Her name is Athena Grant.
You sure you wanna watch that?
I needed to see it for myself.
I'm gonna recommend suspension without pay while the department conducts their investigation.
I'm gonna push for disciplinary action.
Most likely, there'll be no real consequences for their actions?
None that will feel satisfying.
Reynolds has a long list of complaints.
Excessive force, unlawful search and seizure, violation of civil liberties.
Yeah, the problem is he always stops just short of doing something truly awful, so none of it sticks.
Well, maybe it has something to do with who's making the complaints.
Almost every incident on that list involves a black or brown suspect.
I'm aware of the pattern.
But I'm not gonna lie to you, Athena.
This is probably gonna go away, too.
Yeah, for them. But not for my family.
Certainly not for me.
(shouting, clamoring) (rock music) * (grunting) * (grunting) (cheering) * Stock market's closed you don't need to check your portfolio.
I'm making sure Christopher didn't text.
He's not gonna text.
He's having the time of his life.
You, on the other hand, are so amped you can't see straight.
What am I missing, anyways, besides fake fight club.
This is your idea of helping me.
You're a powder keg.
You beat up a guy over a parking space.
But a place like this could be a healthy outlet for your issues.
(laughs) What are you, my therapist now?
Just the chick who bailed you out of jail.
I thought we weren't talking about that.
FIGHT ORGANIZER: Bosko! You're up!
(laughs) Wait, wait. You're fighting.
I'm not the only one with stuff to work out.
Hold my beer.
(Bikini Kill's "Rebel Girl") KATHLEEN: * That girl thinks she's the queen *
* Of the neighborhood * She's got the hottest trike in town * (cheering) * That girl, she holds her head up so high *
* I think I wanna be her best friend, yeah *
* Rebel girl, rebel girl (grunts) (grunting) (cheering) (grunts) (crowd clamoring) (grunts) (both grunt) MAN: Whoa!
(fighters grunting) (cheering) MICHAEL: Thanks for dinner, Bobby.
I really needed to see my kids, you know?
How are you doing?
Ah, I'm still mad as hell.
Me too. I thought the world had changed.
Or I guess I wanted to believe it had.
No, it's not just you.
I got too comfortable. You know, architect, nice house, nice car, married to an LAPD sergeant.
(chuckles) Formerly married.
I thought I was exempt.
And then I was reminded that I'm not.
And neither is my son.
And that's the part that I'm really struggling with.
Because that's the promise that we make, right?
When we have kids -- that their lives are gonna be better and easier than ours were.
Yeah, but Harry's ten.
He shouldn't be worried about anything, except for school, sports and just being a kid.
And now I have to sit him down and talk to him.
The talk.
I have to prepare my son for something that shouldn't even be his responsibility.
I'm sorry. I wish I could say that I know what you're feeling.
No, brother, I'm so glad that you don't.
If it had been worse, if something would've happened to me, I am so happy that they have you because I know you love them like they're your own.
No, Michael. You can't let yourself think like that.
Yeah.
Somehow, I can't seem to stop.
(somber music) * MICHAEL: I need to talk to you about what happened the other night.
Do we have to?
I know it was scary.
But we need to talk about what I could've done differently.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Well, it's not about being right.
Sometimes when you deal with the police, it's about being safe.
Aren't they supposed to keep us safe?
They are.
But not all officers are like your mom.
There are some bad ones.
And there are some that aren't so bad.
But some of them will still treat you like you're different than the other kids.
Because I'm black?
Yes, because you're black.
So you need to know what to do when you come in contact with the police.
Be respectful.
Do what they say.
And don't ever make them feel nervous or panic.
But they're the ones with the guns.
What if I'm more scared than they are?
You probably will be.
But they might not understand that.
So you can't yell or argue with them, even though you think that you're right.
And always keep your hands where they can see them.
No sudden moves. Don't reach for anything. Ever.
What if they ask me for something?
I don't have a driver's license, but -- Right. Well, then you ask them for permission.
Okay?
And then you move very slowly and you tell them what you're doing as you're doing it.
Why are we different?
We are not.
But you just said -- I said that some people will see you differently.
They will look at you and judge you.
But those people will never know who you are.
You are a smart, kind, beautiful black boy who's gonna grow up to be an amazing black man.
Be proud of that.
Don't you ever forget. Promise me.
I promise.
Good.
I love you, Harry.
I love you too, Dad.
* (siren chirps, wails) (radio chatter) I'm a cop, I was ju -- leaving your favorite watering hole after shift?
O'Neil's, right?
License, registration and proof of insurance.
You gotta be kidding me.
Turn off the engine. Step out of the car for me.
(grunts) How much you have to drink tonight?
A couple of beers.
What's a couple?
Two? Twelve?
I'm afraid we're gonna have to do a field sobriety test.
Legally, I can refuse that.
And legally, I can throw you in jail.
Objective symptoms.
Glassy-eyed, smell like alcohol -- since we being all by the book now.
Follow the pen.
You don't give a damn about a DUI.
Careful, now.
I've heard talking back to an officer is liable to get someone slammed up against the hood of a car, even cuffed.
Listen, Sergeant, I didn't know that was your family when we made the stop.
Oh, they were lucky, then.
Somebody else's family, and they could be making funeral arrangements right now.
Walk and turn. You know the drill.
(radio chatter) * It was all a big misunderstanding.
I'm sorry if your family got -- Keep your weak apology.
Stand on one leg.
Humiliating, isn't it?
Being treated like a criminal.
Singled out for no good reason.
Harassed by a police officer with questionable motives.
I can report you.
This is retribution.
If it was retribution, I would've done it when your kids were in the car.
I really am sorry, Sergeant.
You have a nice night, then.
*
* Okay, listen up.
Last couple times we were here, mistakes were made.
That is not gonna happen again.
That is why I am pairing you up on your assignments.
Eddie, Lena, you are on meats and deli.
Nothing leaner than 92% Hen, Chimney, baking aisle.
Unrefined flour this time. Thank you.
I will cover fruits and vegetables.
Once you have everything on your list, we will reconvene at the dairy case.
Let's move!
This must be what the invasion of Normandy felt like.
(laughs) What do you mean he just dropped the charges?
You make it sound like you're disappointed.
Just surprised. Pleasantly.
Apparently, that wasn't the guy's first illegal fight.
And they weighed that against my service record -- Captain America wins a Get Out of Jail Free card?
And anyway, that jackass' knee surgery was three years ago.
But not letting it go. 'Cause that's healthy.
I just think Bobby needs to let go of being pissed off at Buck.
I know that, and so does Bobby.
How you figure?
What do you think this whole shopping trip is all about?
Buck.
Exactly.
It's just a distraction to keep our minds off -- No, no, no. Buck.
Whoa, hey, uh, you guys. What's up?
What are you doing here?
Me, I'm just here to -- to do some -- some shopping.
Eight miles from your apartment?
Yeah, well, this is the only place that has...
Happy Cat laxative powder.
You're buying cat laxative?
Yeah, I've been thinking of, uh, of getting a cat.
And you're anticipating your new cat will be irregular.
Um -- Listen, I --I came here to apologize.
Okay, I --I never meant for things to get so out of hand with the lawsuit and -- Yeah? What'd you think was gonna happen?
The lawsuit's bad enough, but you told your lawyer everything about us -- personal things.
You're supposed to be truthful with your lawyer.
Why are you so pissed at me?
Because you're exhausting.
We all have our own problems, but you don't see us whining about it.
No, somehow, we just manage to suck it up.
Why can't you?
That's kinda harsh. It's not like the guy asked to be crushed by a ladder truck.
No, but he filed a stupid lawsuit, and now I can't even talk to you because of it.
You know how much Christopher misses you?
How could you? You're not around.
(people arguing outside) I --I didn't realize that.
Maybe I can come and visit Christopher.
You know the lawsuit doesn't prevent that.
(arguing continues outside) No, it prevents me from reaching out to you.
I couldn't even call you to bail me out of jail.
MAN: You took my spot, man!
If that was something that happened.
What --what? What are you talking about?
Look, man, why can't you see my side of this?
'Cause that's all you see.
(shouting, crashing) (crashing) WOMAN: What's happening?
Someone should stop her.
These two or those two?
Let's go!
(horn blaring) (crashing) (tires squealing, horn honking) MAN: Hey! Get back here!
(siren wails) (thrilling music) * (shouting) (horn honking) Eddie, Lena, get the tools.
Hen, Chimney, check on the drivers.
(horn honking) (shouting, honking) MAN: I'm gonna die, man!
Hey.
Karen? What's wrong?
The doctor called...
and none of the embryos are good.
Wh --What? We had six. None?
(clears throat) It's just that they had, uh, chromosomal abnormalities or defects.
They have to be discarded.
She did say we can try again.
Maybe do better next time.
Okay, so -- so we'll try again.
But what if it fails again?
I should've frozen my eggs when I was younger, but I just kept thinking there was time.
No, don't --don't do this.
Don't put this on yourself, Karen.
But it is on me.
I'm so sorry.
No, no.
No, this is not your fault.
You did everything exactly right.
Every test, every treatment.
Every doctor's order, you followed it to the letter.
Yeah, and my body has been fighting me every step of the way.
Fighting me.
The IVF, the IUI, the complications and the side effects, and -- It's --it's trying to tell me something.
Give up.
Maybe I should listen.
No.
(sobs) I'm sorry.
No. No.
KAREN: I'm so sorry.
HEN: Don't be.
Don't be.
Sergeant Grant?
I --I'm Officer Andrew Martin.
I was on the scene the other night for your family's traffic stop.
Oh, yeah.
I'm familiar with your work.
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
I --I didn't see your son in the backseat.
And then it was instinct.
A bad one.
When we say "protect and serve," we mean the community, not ourselves.
I remember being a rookie.
The nerves, not knowing what you're walking up on, not sure what to do when you get there.
It's natural to follow your partner's lead.
Just don't follow it off a cliff.
* Do better.
* (rock music playing) So this is your idea of a team-building activity?
BOBBY: Well, trust falls are part of the job.
I can't fix the world. I can't offer some sage advice that's gonna make everything better.
All I can offer is this.
I cannot believe you came.
Rough day.
I really need to break something right now.
What's that?
Cap sprung for the deluxe package.
Full minibar!
They serve alcohol in this place?
Oh, yeah. I'm surprised we don't get more calls from here.
Well, it looks like you have some more team building to do.
(glass shatters) Yeah.
Hey, uh, hey, Bobby.
Thank you for...inviting me.
Look, I --I just wanted to apologize.
You're gonna get a call tomorrow from the Chief.
You're being reinstated to active duty.
The brass didn't want the headache.
They're afraid of the bad press.
Well --(laughs) That --that's awesome.
Yeah, maybe not.
They gave me the option to transfer you.
They understood how I might not want you back after everything you put us through.
But I said no.
You're coming back to the 118 where I can keep an eye on you.
Thanks, Captain.
You won't regret it.
You might.
My house, my rules. Remember that?
* EDDIE: Rage is defined as an intense or violent type of anger.
(screams) SINGER: * Ohh EDDIE: Road rage, office rage, even airplane rage.
SINGER: * This time I won't let go EDDIE: Seems like the whole world is on the edge of snapping lately.
But it's not the only way we use that word.
A raging fire.
A raging storm.
A rager of a party.
All things that are out of control.
And maybe that's where our rage comes from.
A feeling that our world, our lives are out of control.
REYNOLDS: I said don't move!
MICHAEL: Okay, okay!
EDDIE: When we feel helpless...
powerless...
weak...
(panting) Hey, where's Eddie?
LENA: He said he had other plans.
(cheering) (grunting) (grunts) (cheering) SINGER: * Ohh (grunts) SINGER: * This time I won't let go
EDDIE: The rage starts to build, and it needs an outlet.
So what happens when we let it take over?
Do we regain control by unleashing our fury?
Or have we crossed a line we can't come back from?
 @@@@@@
(Stevie Wonder's "Superstition") BECKERSON: All right, everyone, enjoy the harvest festival.
But remember the rules.
Let's play nicely out there, and do not wander off.
We'll meet back here at noon and not one second more.
Really, Ms. Beckerson?
Did you bring a stopwatch?
BECKERSON: We may not be in a classroom, but this is still a school outing, And I will still give you a detention.
You won't need to, Ms. Beckerson.
Yeah, we're here to celebrate the harvest and all the cornucopia it provides.
Go. And behave.
STEVIE: * Very superstitious *
* Writing's on the wall * (roars) (kids screaming) * STEVIE: * Ladder's about to fall *
* 13-month-old baby *
* Broke the lookin' glass * (both hollering) * When you believe in things * That you don't understand * Then you suffer (crow cawing) * Superstition ain't the way *
* Yeah, hey * 26, 27, 28. We're missing two.
Of course we are. I'll be right back.
(crows cawing) (dramatic music) (crows cawing) (panicked yelps) (sirens blaring) (horn honking) (wings fluttering) Two of my students, they were attacked by crows.
They're trapped in there.
I think I've seen this movie.
Okay, let's gear up.
Turnouts and head protection. Let's go.
Damn clasp.
It's fine, Chim, forget the nametag.
We all know who you are.
EDDIE: This is weird.
You see crows all over the city.
Never heard about them attacking anybody.
And that's because crows are very docile.
They don't attack unless they're provoked.
No sudden movements, and we should be good.
CHIMNEY: Damn it.
Just leave it, Chim.
Copy that.
Everybody stay calm.
(eerie music) * Over here. Dean's cut up real bad.
How 'bout you, you okay?
RILEY: Yeah, I think so.
Eddie, check him out.
CHIMNEY: All right, kiddo, let's get you up, so we can take a look.
All right, let's get those irrigated, and make sure no major arteries were hit.
Major arteries? Am I gonna die?
Look, she was just kidding, buddy.
So, Dean, tell me, those crows just attacked you guys from outta nowhere?
It was crazy. Tell 'em Riley.
Uh, yeah, it was like they were possessed or something.
You sure it didn't have anything to do with those rocks you guys threw at them?
He did it.
Liar!
RILEY: I tried to stop him!
Shut up.
Cap.
(crows cawing) (whispering) They know we're in here.
HEN: No, they know they're in here.
Crows are smart.
And they hold grudges.
You think they're waiting for these boys to come out.
They've been known to remember the faces of their tormentors years later and still attack.
Oh, they're bye-crows, great.
How do we get these guys past them?
Well, they're looking for two kids.
We give 'em something else.
(eerie, desolate music) * So what happens if they fly over here?
Well, if you make eye contact with a crow, it could change its behavior.
For better or worse?
Unclear.
Whoa, guys.
(caws) Okay, he's making eye contact with me.
He's not attacking. Go. (whispering) Go, go, go, go.
(playfully tense music) Hey, little buddy.
You hungry, pal, huh?
(whispering) How about a nice, delicious granola bar?
Yeah?
Here you go.
Nice little birdie.
Nice...
(engine starts) Symbol of death and pestilence.
(Stevie Wonder's "Superstition") * STEVIE: (vocalizing) (crow cawing) * When you believe in things *
* That you don't understand CHIMNEY: Hey, Hen.
I think they're on to us.
HEN: Who?
There was a -- * Nothin'.
STEVIE: * Now, now, now (phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) BOBBY: All right, how's that? Is that where you want it?
Yeah, just center it up with the chairs.
All right.
(dog howls distantly) A house full of teenagers alone on Halloween.
That doesn't feel like a bad idea to you?
ATHENA: Eight responsible young adults just watching scary movies and ordering pizza, it'll be fine.
Well, I would just feel better if one of us was here for it.
(chuckles) Doubt that.
What, you think I haven't noticed?
You haven't gotten a full night's sleep in over a week, and there are seven different kind of baked goods in our kitchen.
Just looking for something to do at 3:00 in the morning.
You're worried about tomorrow.
Buck's first day back.
Well, he has signed every liability waiver and release form the department threw at him.
Pretty sure we could drop a piano on Buck's head and he wouldn't be able to sue the city for it.
(laughs) Is that something you planning on doing?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Well, he just --he doesn't think things through.
He acts, reacts, and that leaves the rest of us to have to deal with the fallout.
Yeah, and the hurt feelings.
Look, you are allowed to be angry with Buck and worried about this decision that he's made, but you care about the kid.
Don't let the other stuff make you lose sight of that.
Hmm, all right.
(bright music) * H-hey, how's it going?
Hey --um. (chuckles) (melancholy music) * Welcome back.
You are the first person to say that to me.
Starting to feel like I should have brought a sweater 'cause I am definitely catching a chill.
You got friends here, Buck.
But they all feel like they gotta follow Cap's lead.
He's still -- Not in a congratulatory cake and banner place yet.
Hey.
Red velvet.
It bleeds when you cut it.
(laughs) I missed you guys.
Hey, how is the, uh, baby-making going?
You and Karen knocked up yet?
Mm, it's a long process.
It's more twists and turns than you might expect.
It's good to have you back.
BUCK: Thanks, Hen.
For this and...
for not feeling like you need to follow Bobby's lead.
I march to the beat of my own drum.
Always have.
You should too.
(chuckles) Whew, dude, are you okay? That's a monster.
Just roughhousing with my kid.
Were you playing with hammers?
Nothing you need to be concerned with.
CHIMNEY: Welcome back, Firefighter Buckley.
Thanks, Chim, glad to be back.
All right, now that we've got that out of the way, morning briefing...
(alarm bell ringing) Buck, you're man behind today.
Uh, wh --I'm not going with you guys? Cap.
My house, my rules, remember?
You stay put.
(horn honks) * TARA: Okay, yeah.
That's --no. I don't know.
The dealership said they'd call when they figure out why my car won't start, again.
Maddie, my client, you met her.
Okay, okay, I know.
Everything all right?
Yeah. My husband bought me a car that "looked cool," but now it's my fault every time it breaks down.
Oh, here, you can just drop that on the curb, I don't wanna keep you.
It's enough that you drove me home.
No, don't worry about it. Wasn't gonna leave you in a parking lot with a car that didn't start.
I wasn't expecting all the luggage.
Yeah, I would have left it all in my car, but I have some appointments tomorrow, private clients.
Thanks again. I owe you.
You know, I just, uh -- I just thought of a way you could repay me.
Can I use your bathroom?
Sure, yeah. Come on in.
(cell phone ringing) Uh, bathroom's over there.
Hey.
No, Vincent, it's not like that.
Vincent, I --I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.
(whispering) Just listen to me.
I tried, I really -- but they wouldn't let me -- (suspenseful music) * Thought you needed to use the bathroom?
You walked right past it.
I am sorry. You caught me.
The view up here is amazing, and I just had to see it.
Do you want a drink?
Sure.
TARA: I'm afraid I don't have anything to go with that.
We don't entertain much.
Vincent hates having people over.
Ah.
My ex was a lot like that, too.
Always wanted it to just be the two of us.
Ugh.
Me, I needed friends, family, you know, a life outside our home.
Right, I mean, he just doesn't get that.
And that is why I love my job.
I get to meet new people and actually talk to them.
I'm sure you have other people to talk to.
You know, people you trust?
Of course, yeah.
(mellow pop music plays over speakers) So is that why your ex is...an ex?
(sighs) Part of it.
I spent a lot of years trying to be the perfect wife.
Then I realized one day that I deserved better.
So you left him.
Good for you.
I, um, can't imagine that was easy.
Yeah, leaving is always scary.
But I am proof that there's always a way out.
(Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers'"American Girl") * TOM: * Well, she was an American girl * WOMAN: No, I got it.
I printed the list out before I left work.
It was multiple pages.
WOMAN (over phone): I thought the party rental people were coming at 8:00.
Turns out it's a window, 8:00 to 2:00.
Six hours?
Ugh, fine, I will run the errands while you wait for the delivery guys.
WOMAN (over phone): Thanks! It's gonna be an epic party.
Bye.
(phone beeps) I'm not even gonna have time to get a costume.
(gasps) (screams) TOM: * Make it last all night * She was an American girl * Uh huh huh * (ominous music) Why did I always think that she was his sister, and that's why he was trying to kill her?
Because she is but you don't find that out until Halloween II.
Truthfully, I've always thought that was a bit of a retcon.
So what happens in the third movie?
Nothing that has anything to do with Michael Myers.
Right.
(laughter) Maddie?
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Um, we just caught a movie.
Vincent, you remember Maddie.
Good to see you again.
Hi.
(chuckles) (music plays indistinctly over speakers) Hi, I'm Howie, but everyone calls me Chimney.
Sorry, Tara is my trainer at the gym.
Oh, I didn't realize you were working with a trainer.
Uh, that's a very nice place that you work at.
It's very clean.
Oh, are you a member?
I'm an occasional visitor in the line of duty.
I'm a paramedic.
I've responded to a call or two at your place.
Oh, that's so great. A nurse and a paramedic.
I mean, it must be nice to have someone who totally gets your job.
Yeah, um, actually we have to go because Chim has an early shift.
Tomorrow's Halloween, big day.
Sure, yeah, see you at the gym.
Nice meeting you.
Yep.
Okay, you wanna tell me what that was all about?
What?
With your trainer, that I didn't even know you had, and why does she think you're a nurse?
It's complicated.
Maddie, that is not an answer.
She called 911, five times in two months, which is a pattern with -- Abused women. Maddie.
You sought her out?
I was worried about her, okay?
So I went to the gym where she works.
You're lying to her.
You're pretending to be someone else.
You're inserting yourself into her life under false pretenses.
You're overreacting.
And you are acting just like Doug.
This is exactly what he did to me before he literally stabbed me.
He invented a reason to meet me, he pretended to be someone else, then he tricked me into thinking he was my friend.
Okay, this is not like Doug.
All right? I am trying to help her.
You can't help someone by lying to them, Maddie.
You already know that, otherwise you would have told me about this creepy stalker plan weeks ago.
That's not fair.
Wait, okay, maybe.
But what you're doing to that woman isn't either.
You need to tell her the truth.
Yeah, I will, okay, I just need a little bit more time.
You know what, we should go.
I have a shift in the morning, remember?
At least you didn't lie about that.
Halloween. Big day.
BOBBY: Think you could handle it?
Teal bucket is for kids with food allergies.
Everything in there is nut-free, dairy-free, egg-free, soy-free, and gluten-free.
And who are these for?
Kids allergic to fun?
Those are for the parents.
Also there should be some pamphlets about basic fire safety that should be in the closet.
Exactly how long are you gonna keep on punishing me?
You know, Buck, some day you're gonna figure out when to stop pushing and learn some patience.
I hope we're both alive to see it.
CHIMNEY: You know, being stuck here isn't actually the end of the world, it just feels like it, Buck.
Trust me, I know.
(chuckles) No, I do.
My first few months here, only time I saw the outside of this building was at the start and end of my shift, on my way in, on my way out.
How'd you cope with it?
Cleaned every inch of this place.
Learned where everything was, how all the equipment worked.
Set a new world record for getting in my turnout gear.
And then eventually, someone took pity on me, and they let me outside.
So basically, um, suck it up and be patient.
Just like Bobby said.
You know, Cap's not always wrong.
Though he is about these smoke detectors.
Nobody's gonna want these tonight.
No, but I am gonna hand them out anyway.
Captain's orders.
See?
It can be taught.
In fact, I'm gonna go find those pamphlets.
Hey, uh, have you talked to Maddie today?
No, I think she's working.
Why?
Nothing, just wondering.
(crow caws) (funky music) (caws) Okay, are you a good omen or a bad omen?
'Cause, you know, I Googled you, and the old wives are kind of divided on this question.
(caws) Is anybody else seeing this?
Seeing what?
(ominous music) * Oh, God!
The list, you forgot the list.
(upbeat instrumental music) * (mariachi music) * That one's so cool. Right there.
Oh, that's pretty convincing, if a little bit twisted.
It's sick is what it is.
It just perpetuates a culture of socially acceptable violence and desensitizes -- Oh, my God!
Whoa.
That level of violence is totally acceptable to me.
Did you -- I did.
Was that -- I don't know.
MAN (over phone): Yes, hello, I think there's a body sticking out of somebody's car windshield.
I'm sorry?
MAN (over phone): There's a woman driving around in a gold, mid-sized sedan with a man stuck in the windshield, like, through the windshield.
Are you sure it wasn't a Halloween decoration?
That's what we thought it was at first, but it moved.
So we're pretty sure he's alive or was.
They just turned off onto the 101 at Western.
It was a California plate.
The first two digits were Q7.
I'll alert the police and let them know.
Okay, all units be on the lookout for a gold, mid-sized sedan, California plate partial number queen seven.
Eyewitness reports a man in the windshield.
MAN (over radio): Dispatch, is this a real thing?
Find the car and get back to me.
Okay, so far today I've had three suspected hangings, two possible decapitations, and one truly convincing evisceration.
Hmm, let me guess. All fake?
Thank God, or L. A. is having a seriously weird crime spree.
(laughs) Nice costume.
Did that take 12 whole minutes to put together?
Ew, no, it took 45 minutes to go to the drugstore and get these ears.
Mm.
9-1-1, what's your emergency?
BUCK: That's it, get your candy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry, buddy, two-piece limit.
Those are the rules.
That's a stupid rule.
Yeah, not the world's greatest defense strategy.
What are you supposed to be, anyway?
I'm firefighter.
So how come you're not out fighting fires?
(truck horn honks) Mom, look, the real firefighters are here.
Oh, my gosh. Is he trying to get more candy out of you?
Uh, no, no, he's fine.
In fact, here, why don't you take a smoke detector.
Keep him safe until his parole hearing.
BOBBY: Nice work, Buckley. Keep it up.
Oh, Eddie, um, you wanna give me a hand with all this?
Nah, you got this. You're 100%.
Lawsuit proved that, right?
(melancholy music) (Oingo Boingo's "Dead Man's Party") (together) Trick or treat!
Hello, we got a big crowd, here. (laughs) Nice costumes.
(doorbell rings) (together) Trick or treat!
(doorbell rings) (together) Trick or treat.
(doorbell rings) Whoa.
Are you --let's see, are you -- Hey, are you all right?
(dramatic music) Honey, call 911!
You took your costume off.
I barely recognize you without those glasses, Clark Kent.
Shouldn't you be off walking a plank or something?
More like three parties to hit before midnight.
Jealous?
No, I'm exhausted even thinking about that.
Oh, Sue was here a minute ago looking for you.
She was talking to someone in the conference room, so maybe she went back in there.
Okay, I'll check. Thanks.
Sue?
Tara, um -- I'm here to file a complaint against the 9-1-1 dispatcher who's been stalking me.
How did you -- I shoulda known something was up when you conned your way into my house, but I thought I was being paranoid.
Then I met your boyfriend, and he doesn't have a very good poker face.
Does he know you're a psycho?
Or should I swing on by the firehouse and fill him in.
I was gonna tell you.
Okay.
I was, I just hadn't figured out how to do it, you know?
How to explain everything to you and help you understand.
You lied to me. You pretended to be my friend.
No, I am your friend.
Or, at least, I wanted to be.
I have been you, Tara.
Trapped in a marriage with an abusive man, needing to ask for help -- I don't need any help.
You called 911 five times.
I am not one of those women.
Yeah, I used to tell myself that too.
I didn't wanna admit what was happening because I felt ashamed.
But I had nothing to be ashamed of.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Just tell me the truth, and I will leave you alone.
I swear.
There is nothing to tell!
Stay away from me and my husband.
I know I'm right about him.
Look, I know I'm right!
Maddie, we need to talk.
NURSE: Someone mistreated her. Badly.
She's severely malnourished.
I'm not talking about missing a few meals; this is systemic.
But until she regains consciousness and can consent to a more thorough exam, we can't know for sure what she's been through.
What about her injuries? The cuts on her arm?
NURSE: Appears to be from broken glass.
We found tiny slivers of it inside the wounds.
Significant bruising on both wrists and ankles.
Most likely, she was shackled.
Anything about the soles of her feet?
Something to indicate how far she's walked.
No bruises, no blisters, no lacerations, they were just dirty.
Sorry I can't give you more.
No, you gave me a place to start.
Now, missing persons is checking reports, looking for a match on our girl, hasn't found anything yet.
Fan out, do a grid search, knock on every door, talk to every person you see in the street.
Then ask them what, see anything unusual?
It's Halloween, Sergeant.
(sighs) (spooky rock music) * Maybe the idea's not to be seen at all.
Let's find out which of these houses isn't feeling the holiday spirit.
(indistinct radio chatter) (ominous music) * There you go.
* (knocking) LAPD, anybody home?
LAPD!
(suspenseful music) * (door creaks) Hello, anybody home?
(insects buzzing) (coughs) Anybody home? This is the police.
Hello?
(girl coughing distantly) (water trickling) (gags) Holy Mother of God.
(eerie music) * (dramatic music) * They're all in various stages of dehydration, malnutrition, any number of infections, probably have diseases we invented the cure for 100 years ago.
No gas, no running water, God knows how they bathed or cooked food.
Give it a hard enough kick, the house would fall down.
All we found was canned food, bibles, textbooks, all from the 1950s.
I just got one of the kids to talk.
You're not gonna believe this.
These kids weren't abducted. They live here.
They're siblings. Their parents did this to them.
(car horn honking) Hey, stop, you can't drive through here.
(tires screeching) Those are my kids.
What the hell are you doing with my children?
Did you find her? Where's Bethany?
Who?
Our daughter.
We've been looking for her for hours.
She's lost and alone.
Alone, right, just like you left the rest of your children.
They were secure. They were safe.
Chained up, you mean.
Your daughter's in the hospital.
Which is where we're taking the others until children and family services gets there.
You two, however, are going to jail.
Read 'em their rights.
MAN: You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I reviewed all five of the calls that were placed from the Dagastino home.
The first four times, she claims that she dialed a wrong number.
The fifth one, the one that you took, That area's a little gray.
Yeah, I knew that something -- I'm gonna stop you there.
Here's what I, as your supervisor, can prove.
This dispatch center received several calls from Mrs. Dagastino.
You took one of them.
Shortly after that, you joined a gym, hired a personal trainer who happened to be Mrs. Dagastino.
We can call that a coincidence but there are not going to be any more, Maddie.
Do you understand me?
I do, but I just want you to know the -- No, we're done talking about that woman.
Now we're going to talk about you and your future here.
I promise that this will never happen again.
(sighs) You've been through a lot, personally and professionally.
This job --we experience the same trauma that all the other first responders do and sometimes we burn out.
Okay, that's --that's not what this is.
Well, I'm gonna have to have someone confirm that for me.
I'm scheduling you for a psychological assessment.
But I'm not --I'm not due for another one until next year.
And you will not go back on that floor until it's done.
Also, schedule a session with our counselor.
That's not a suggestion.
NEWS REPORTER: A couple was arrested tonight on charges of reckless endangerment and child abuse and are being held without bail.
Children were found -- HEN: You know, Karen and I make jokes about locking Denny up.
For his protection.
But the truth is, protecting him like that, it wouldn't be for him.
It'd be for us.
You know, we'd be robbing him to give ourselves some peace of mind.
(somber music) * That's not very subtle.
It's really late, and I'm really tired.
You think I'm being too hard on him?
I think Buck makes everything hard on Buck.
The boy has two settings, zero and shut up before I smack you.
I can see that he's trying.
It just still seems like he doesn't get it.
Like this is all a game to him.
Cap, the city offered him a huge settlement.
He could be jumping out of planes or swimming somewhere with sharks if he were looking for a game.
But he made his choice. He chose this job.
So I should let him do it.
Or let him go somewhere else that will.
So that's how it's gonna be now.
You're just gonna keep on ghosting me.
'Cause Halloween is over, just so you know.
I don't know what you want from me, Buck.
Forgive, forget, make you feel better about what you did?
I just want you to talk to me.
(chuckles) Even if it's just to say that you're still mad.
I'm not mad, I'm -- (somber music) When you decided to sue the department, to make Cap the bad guy, did you ever stop for a minute to think what that could do to us?
Look, I just needed my job back.
I missed --I missed being here.
Being part of the team.
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.
Lotta "I"s in there.
Your actions, your choices, they impact the rest of us.
That's what it means to be a part of a team.
You're right.
I didn't think about what could happen.
I was mad at Bobby for not letting me back.
I was mad at you guys for moving on without me.
I was mad that there was nothing I could do about it.
And I just --I just wanted to -- Punch someone?
Yeah, a little.
But I get it.
And I really am sorry.
Whatever it takes for you to forgive me -- I forgive you.
Also what it means to be part of a team.
This...
just don't do it again.
(laughter) BOBBY: Buckley.
Candy detail's all wrapped up, Cap, and I gave away all the smoke detectors.
Listen, Buck, I've been thinking.
Why don't you go home?
Home?
I still have a couple hours left on my shift.
I don't wanna overtax you your first week back.
I stood behind a table and got bullied by children.
So you earned a few hours off.
Good work today.
(somber music) (car engine revving) Oh, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey! Lady, lady!
Ah, damn it. Come on.
(dramatic music) (tires squealing) MAN (over phone): 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
This is LAFD firefighter Evan Buckley.
I'm going south down Vermont following a gold, 4-door sedan.
There is a man embedded in the windshield.
MAN (over phone): Sorry, did you say in the windshield?
We had a report about that yesterday.
Is that real?
Uh, yeah, it's definitely real, and I think he's alive.
I'm gonna approach the vehicle right now.
Ma'am! Ma'am, pull over your car!
You are a horrible driver.
You are right in my way.
Ma'am, I'm a firefighter.
Really? Well your costume sucks.
Okay, can I just take a look at your -- Did you hurt yourself?
What? What do you mean?
(groaning softly) Uh, hey --you just stay right here, okay?
Ah.
Sir, sir, it's LAFD.
Help is on its way.
(siren whooping) Want us to check you out?
Oh, nah, it's not mine. I have another shirt in my -- (dramatic music) Maybe.
You should know, I'm --I'm on blood thinners.
MADDIE: Hey.
Hey.
I was just gonna call ya.
I feel like I should apologize. I know I was a little harsh.
You were right.
Tara found out who I am.
She came to the call center; I almost lost my job.
And I'm starting to think that, maybe, I'm losing my mind.
No, you're not. You're still healing.
It doesn't happen overnight.
What Doug did to me, to you -- he was a monster.
And when I think about what I'm doing to Tara, what does that make me?
Someone who cares.
I mean, maybe too much or maybe in the wrong way, but you saw someone you thought was in trouble and, you know, you tried to help her.
I really thought I was right.
I mean, I thought I could save her, that I could get her out before it was too late, before she'd have to -- Save herself?
The way you did?
(somber music) I might be a little crazy.
(laughter) That's nothing.
You wanna hear something really crazy?
(whispering) I see crows.
(laughter) No, I'm serious, ever since that call at the pumpkin patch, I keep seeing this one bird, like, everywhere.
The one on the ambulance?
Yes, on the ambulance, on the fire truck, outside in the parking lot.
No, on the ambulance.
(funky music) CHIMNEY: (whispering) Okay, you see it, right?
Like, you actually see it?
(chuckles) (cawing) (laughs) I'll be damned.
He brought it back to me.
(laughter) Except now he knows my name.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient brought in not long ago. Evan Buckley?
Bobby?
Hey.
BUCK: Hey.
Said you were injured, that you cut yourself.
(scoffs) Yeah, I just got some shallow cuts from the broken windshield glass.
I told the paramedics I was on blood thinners and they sealed the wounds.
But they brought you here, to the ER?
Right, no, they just thought I should get checked up.
I just finished giving the police my statement.
But what happened?
It was crazy, this lady hit this guy two days ago.
She must have hit her head pretty bad, 'cause they found a brain bleed.
Probably why she was so confused.
And what about the guy on the windshield.
In surgery, docs say he's got a fair chance.
It's cause you jumped in there and saved him.
Probably didn't even occur to you to worry about yourself.
Yeah, I know, I know, I didn't think, just rushed in like I always do.
I guess it's like the uniform is my costume.
You know, I put it on and suddenly I'm brave, and I'm strong, I make a difference.
Feels like without it I'm not much of anything.
Buck, you saved two lives without the uniform.
It's not a costume, it's who you are.
Does this mean that you're ready to let me back for real?
Doesn't matter if I'm ready. You are.
It's time for me to get out of your way.
Hey, Bobby.
Are you hungry?
Maybe I could buy you breakfast.
Be nice to catch up.
Yeah, it would.
(uplifting music)
 @@@@@@
(tense music) So Darius...
May tells me that you're not going to college next fall.
No, Ms., uh, Ms. Grant.
Mrs. Nash.
Um, I'm taking a gap year and then hopefully Stanford.
Stanford is a great school.
What do you plan on studying?
Well, both of my parents are doctors -- What does one do in a gap year?
Bounce around Europe with backpack and a rail pass?
(laughter) Mom, be nice.
I'm not being nice?
No, you're being Grandma Bea.
So what kind of doctor do you plan on being?
You know, just working with, um...
Darius, I didn't even go to college.
Wait, that's an option?
ATHENA: No.
MICHAEL: No.
(door bell rings) BOBBY: I'll get it.
Oh. Um, we should get going.
We don't want to miss the movie.
Come on, Darius.
Wait, May, I thought the movie started at 9:00.
Well, you know, traffic and parking and we need time for the bathroom and ticket booth and all that, so we're probably already late.
Dinner was great. Pleasure meeting you all.
Yes, I'll see you soon at 11:30 when you drop May off at the door.
At the door.
Okay, all right.
Have fun.
Elaine, hey. What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
Didn't mean to interrupt your dinner.
Oh, no, we just finished.
You want something? Come on in.
No, no, um...
I had some unexpected news today, and...
I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else.
Okay.
We found the gun that killed Emmett.
(dramatic music) Athena?
Are...
are you sure?
Yeah, I had them check and double-check before I came here.
Who's Emmett?
I have no earthly idea.
Who's Emmett?
Uh, Emmett Washington.
He was my fiancé.
(phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) Found it during a traffic stop.
Tomas Alma. 19.
Too young to be Emmett's killer and currently not speaking to us.
Gun has probably gone through a lot of hands since '91.
I'm putting a lot of guys on this one.
You don't have to worry.
Look, I may have to take a few days off.
I'm sorry if I stepped in it the other night.
I didn't know that -- That I haven't talked about Emmett in 20 years.
There's no way you could've known.
Yeah.
If I hear anything, I'll call next time.
Thanks.
SINGER: * All you've got to do now, express yourself * DR. DRE: * I'm expressing with my full capabilities *
* And now I'm living in correctional facilities *
* 'Cause some don't agree with how I do this *
* I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist * Waste of time.
It's not a waste of time, Athena.
We're opening ourselves up to the world of possibilities on offer.
Please. What kind of person upends their whole life because someone handed them a flyer?
Cheryl.
(laughter) Ladies, can I interest you in an exciting career opportunity?
LAPD's looking for the best and the brightest to join our ranks, and you three seem like prime candidates.
Appreciate the sales pitch, but we're already on our career paths.
Lawyers and police are all part of the same system.
We just get to the bad guys first.
You seem cool, but the only people folks hate more than lawyers are cops.
Okay?
At least we're paid better.
That's right.
True.
EMMETT: People only hate police until they need us.
No, sometimes they hate you after.
(laughing) Let's go.
Wait.
I'm Emmett.
In case you decide to give us another look.
SINGER: * All you've got to do now, express yourself * GABI: Wouldn't mind giving him another look.
Wow.
Hmm.
"Where's that soap you put in the dishwasher?" "Which dry cleaners has my blue suit?" (laughs) I swear that phone never stopped ringing.
Aww, Daddy's lost without you.
I can't believe he let you come out here by yourself.
Well, he knew better than to try to stop me.
(laughter) It's been hard, you so far away from home.
I am half a mind to make your father move out here so we can see you more often.
You couldn't get Daddy here for five days.
How you gonna get him here for the rest of his life?
That's where you come in.
Grandbabies.
Mama.
We've talked about this.
I have to finish law school and get a good job, then I will find a good man, and I will give you grandbabies.
You do not get to shuffle the order because you're bored in Florida.
(laughter) Oh, Athena. I didn't tell you.
Your daddy said Mrs. Kingston passed away last night.
What?
She's you age. What happened?
They're saying cancer, but I think it's more like heartbreak.
She never got over losing that girl.
Did they ever find out what happened to Tanya?
Who took her?
Not sure how hard they looked.
You know, Mrs. Kingston went to that police station every month begging for help, searching for answers.
Maybe she has them now.
(somber music) * YOUNG MC: * Bust it (Young MC's "Bust a Move") * This here's a jam for all the fellas * EMMETT: Well, the department's goal is 20% female officers.
We're about halfway there.
10%? Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be outnumbered nine to one?
What? That's --talk about sticking out in a crowd.
I imagine you'd stick out in any crowd, regardless of the demographic makeup.
Well, now I'm starting to wonder exactly what you're trying to recruit me for.
All right, all right, look.
I can spout off facts and figures all night.
It'll be boring, not to mention a terrible way for you to decide what to do with your life.
Yeah, well, how did you figure it out?
Hang up the classifieds, throw a dart?
Sixth grade.
Two narcotics detectives came to my class.
They had a slide presentation for us.
Reasons to join the LAPD?
Nope. Crime scene photos.
Pictures of people who died because of drugs.
The way those guys talked about our world, our community, how broken it was, it opened my eyes.
That's when I knew I had to do something to make it better.
SINGER: * Baby, you got it ATHENA: Quit law school six weeks later.
HEN: Wow.
I had no idea. I never even suspected it.
Athena, you are good at these secrets.
Don't be mad.
You know, you once told me that it's the not knowing that haunts us.
You were talking about yourself.
Well, I've seen what comes from living with ghosts, the toll it takes.
I mean, the man who fired that bullet had already taken so much from me.
I wasn't gonna let him have the rest.
I just put all my grief, my pain, locked it in a box.
That's the only way I knew how to move forward.
So how does it feel now?
Now that Pandora's cracked open that box.
Feels more like I'm the one who's cracked open.
I mean, I know they have a million questions.
I'm just not ready to answer them.
So that's why you're here with me?
You're hiding.
I...I don't know how to talk about...
him without talking about what happened after him.
I mean, I threw myself into my job.
Just focused all my efforts on trying to make a difference, you know?
In the world, the department, my way of honoring him.
Okay, so...you got the gun.
That's a big break in the case, right?
Yeah.
Can you track it?
Well, technically, I can't do anything.
I mean, everyone from my captain to my husband has made me promise not to go near it.
Just let the detectives do their jobs.
(laughs) Athena.
You have never been one to be hung up on a technicality.
(dramatic music) * Hey.
Hey.
Thought you could use a pick-me-up.
Thanks.
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep.
Me, either.
You've been keeping tabs on the case?
Emmett was my partner.
Never sat right that we couldn't solve it.
Wasn't much to go on.
Just a bullet and this guy.
I mean, I stared at him so many nights, I could probably draw him from memory.
Oh.
I'm sorry. You like it with sugar.
It's fine. I'll be right back.
(laughs) * (sighs) Ugh.
I gotta go and pick up the kids.
I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, okay.
All right, thanks.
Hey, Athena, wait.
I know we've both been waiting for this a long time...
but I promise you, we're gonna find him.
Yes.
We will.

Franklin, you ride with Sanchez, and, Morris, you're with...
Morris. Okay, well, that's a typo.
Just...come and see me. Okay, that's it.
Pool assignments are on the board.
Don't get dead, and don't dent my cars.
Go.
(indistinct chatter) Hi, Officer McCluskey?
Hi, Athena Carter. It's a pleasure to meet you.
No, it's not. Look, for whatever reason, I keep getting shouldered with schooling you people.
Oh, hell.
No, I don't mean it like that, so don't go there.
So you don't think women can do the job?
I think you don't want to.
Or at least not for very long.
I've been doing this for 28 years.
I've passed down my knowledge to five female rookies, all who fell in love, got married, and left the force to have kids, so I got...
what do you call it?
Abandonment issues.
Hmm. I'm serious about this job, so I'm happy to take any wisdom you want to send my way, but you should treat me the way you would any other officer.
SINGER: * Ooh, ladies first * Ladies first CHORUS: * Ooh, ladies first * Ladies first * Ooh, ladies first (Queen Latifah's "Ladies First") * QUEEN LATIFAH: * The ladies will kick it * The rhyme that is wicked * Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted *

(knocking at door) So how was the first day?
Oh.
(siren wailing) MONIE LOVE:* Pleased with all the beats and rhymes *
* My sisters have employed, slick and smooth * I need you to turn around, put your hands up now.
MONIE LOVE: * To my sister, can I get some? * QUEEN LATIFAH: * Sure, Monie Love * Grab the mic and get dumb, yo * (both grunting) MONIE LOVE: * Believe me * When I say being a woman is great, you see *
* I know that all the fellas out there will agree with me * WATCH COMMANDER: Finally, I'm told the LAPD is on track for the fewest number of officer-involved shootings since 1981.
Now, let's try not to shoot anyone until the '90s, okay?
EMMETT: Ma, this is Athena.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Washington.
Emmett was right. You are a beauty.
(laughter) Hope you brought protection.
Ma'am?
From the girls at church.
When they see you with my boy...
ooh.
(laughter) ALL: Four, three, two, one.
Happy New Year!
(cheering) So that happened.
Come on, after midnight's when the real crazies come out.
I don't want to miss it.
You're just excited you get to shoot people again.
Oh, that's right. I forgot about that.
QUEEN LATIFAH: * You never catch me at my worst *
* You get the drift?
* It's Ladies First (sirens wailing) (indistinct radio chatter) (dramatic music) Damn, bitch. Watch the cuffs!
Exercise your right to be silent before I force it on you.
McCluskey, we got another one for processing.
EMMETT: Excuse me, prosecutor, but I object.
This is not your sector.
But it is my collar. You know Mack.
He doesn't believe in being confined to sectors.
EMMETT: Yeah, but he sure knows how to find primo crime scenes.
ROMERO: Emmett.
Escorting our wounded friend to Mercy West. Meet me?
EMMETT: Right behind you, Rick.
So you working Sunday?
No, I'm off. Why?
EMMETT: You'll see.
Okay.
We better call the restaurant, tell them that we're gonna be late.
Or we could just stay in.
Order a pizza.
Where's the phone?
Found it.
(exhales) This wasn't how I thought it would go.
I had a whole speech planned.
I was gonna do it when they brought out the tiramisu.
I love tiramisu.
I know.
(exhales) So...
Athena Carter...
will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes.
(squeals) (heartfelt music) * I love you.
I love you, too.
Oh, my God, I can't believe you said yes!
(laughter) BOBBY: I'm back.
ROMERO: You forgot the sugar? You played me.
ATHENA: I wanted to keep you out of it.
Why? You don't think I want a crack at this guy too?
Emmett was my best friend.
Whatever you're up to -- You can't be a part of it, Rick.
Look, I don't know what's gonna happen, but there's a pretty good chance I'm gonna be out of a job when it's done.
I'm not taking you down with me.
I'm willing to take that risk.
I'm not.
Here.
This is everything we have on Emmett's murder, including background on the gun's most recent owner.
I've highlighted some interesting ATM withdrawals.
Hey, Bobby.
BOBBY: Rick.
What's going on?
Nothing. Rick's just upset.
That you're investigating Emmett's murder on your own?
The thing you told me you were not gonna do?
Look, Athena, just talk to me.
I know what it's like to lose someone.
I did not lose someone.
He was taken from me.
Now you may understand my pain, but you do not understand struggle.
I need to do this.
Bring his killer in? On your own?
Oh, no one else has gotten the job right.
Why not me?
I'm more than capable.
Well, there is a man who has gotten away with murder for almost 30 years.
You think he's gonna be happy to see you show up on his doorstep?
Don't much care about his feelings.
No, I want you to care about our safety.
There's no backup.
Nobody knows where you're going or who you're talking to.
It's reckless, dangerous.
It's necessary.
He needs to pay for what he's done.
And I need to make sure that that happens.
I have to do this. It has to be me.
Why?
Be...
(sighs) Because I'm the reason that Emmett was killed.
I'm the reason he's dead.
(dramatic music) * MICHAEL: Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
She didn't say anything else?
Completely shut down.
Oh, come on.
I know I shouldn't be mad at her, but -- Wait, let me skip right to the end, brother.
You should be. We both should be.
Well, my hands aren't clean here.
I've...
hid things too, from a lot of people.
Which she knew before she even walked down the aisle.
Look, we told her our secrets.
We spilled our guts, man. And she told us nothing.
Well, she did forgive us.
Well, I'm gonna forgive her, too, right after I finish this bottle.
(laughs) Moved my things into Harry's room.
Why'd you do that?
So you'd have a place to sleep of this bottle.
(laughs) A guest in my own damn house.
Hey, you know what, man? I built this patio.
And you did a great job.
I know. And you're welcome.
Wait, still no word from Mom?
No.
MAY: You know I could text her.
Say I'm in the hospital, or something.
She'd come running.
Then kill us all.
Yeah.
MAY: She'd still come.
She's my mom.
Hey, May, can you keep an eye on your dad?
I'll be right back.
MAY: Where you going?
Calling reinforcements.
(indistinct radio chatter) MCCLUSKEY: 12 Adam 30, we are Code 6.
I repeat, we are Code 6.
Out of car on investigation?
Except we're neither.
What central don't know won't hurt 'em.
Okay, so what are we looking for?
Him. Police 101.
Follow the money.
How do you know he bought it here?
The guy made multiple ATM withdrawals to pay for it.
Last one? From the ATM cross the street.
An hour later, he's in his car with this gun on his way to kill his boss.
How could I know that would happen?
It's called a 10-day waiting period.
I got a lot of friends who can do me a lot of favors, but I won't help you if you don't help me.
Tell me where you got this gun.
Come on.
Couple came in a couple of weeks back.
Said they found it in the attic.
Name and address is probably fake.
But the thumb print is real.
It's the girlfriend's.
Marianna Petrossian.
LAPD. I'm looking for your boyfriend.
Which one?
The one who used your fingerprint to pawn a murder weapon at Ray's Loan and Collateral.
MCCLUSKEY: (chuckling) Come on. Criminals are dumb.
They won't ever admit that.
I mean, they all think they're geniuses.
Smarter than us for damn sure.
Sounds like you admire that.
MCCLUSKEY: I find it useful.
Always let them think they have the upper hand.
Right until you take them down.
Modest little number.
Not your standard stock and trade.
Where'd you get it?
Are you sure I did?
Because I have been having quite the day.
The most recent owner led me to a thumb print, which got me to a girl whose father bought it from a co-worker who took it in a divorce.
The ex-wife picked it up at a gun show from a dealer who got it from a collector who claimed he bought it on the street.
Check this...your street.
I did a favor for a single mom.
You're a detective?
LAPD, ma'am.
About the gun?
My ex gave it to me.
For protection.
I always kept it in the gun safe.
I locked and unlocked that thing a million times.
Be careful.
Never realized the kids saw me doing it.
That they knew the combination.
(gunshot echoes) I just...I got rid of it.
Do you know where your ex got it?
His cousin.
Maurizio.
I didn't get it from anyone.
I found it.
You found it?
Yeah. My first big job.
A motel.
I was prepping one of the rooms.
Took off a vent cover, and...
ATHENA: Remember which motel?
They may still have records.
I doubt it.
It was the Crestview on Crenshaw.
(sighs) They tore that down ten years ago.
Said they were building a shopping center, and they never did.
The lot's just dead.
(dramatic music) Something smells good.
Mama?
Heard your life blew up again.
* (footsteps approaching) Hey, hey.
Don't be too hard on Bobby.
You worried about him? (laughs) That's new.
He showed more sense than you ever have.
Calling me.
Admitting he needed help.
You can't help with this, Mama.
All these years I respected your wishes.
I never spoke of Emmett.
Thought it would let you heal.
But you never did.
It sounds silly.
But I thought maybe if I could find the man who killed him, Emmett would finally be at peace.
Baby.
He's been at peace for decades.
You're the one still battling this.
It was not your fault.
He was there because of me, Mama.
Because he loved you.
And you loved him.
Wherever he is now, he knows what I know.
You would have taken that bullet for him.
(melancholy music) * I just don't know how to tell them.
I don't even know where to begin.
Maybe you can start there.
Wow.
BEATRICE: So handsome.
The son I always wanted.
HARRY: Wow.
So I could've had a completely different dad.
No. No, you couldn't.
You'd be a completely different person.
You are who you are because of your dad and me and who we were when we had you.
I have regrets about Emmett and how he died, but...
I do not regret this family.
I love you all, and I could not imagine my life without you in it.
We all love you, too.
(poignant music) * I'm sorry, Mom.
I wish we had known about him sooner.
Oh.
MICHAEL: Hey, but we know now.
And we do not want you to put this in a box for another 30 years.
BOBBY: Go get your answers, Athena.
We'll all be here when you're done.
I really appreciate your helping me with this.
I know it's a long shot.
Of course.
How long of a shot are we talking about?
(laughs) '91? We don't keep calls that far back.
Uh, not the audio.
You know what? We'll still have the logs.
Okay.
Wow, that is a lot of calls.
Can you filter by location?
Crestview Motel on Crenshaw.
Just under 2,000 calls from '91 to '96.
2,000? I thought the motel was in L. A., not a war zone.
Early '90s, a little hard to tell the difference sometimes.
Okay, all I'm seeing here are date, time, address, and some code.
How can we get more information?
I put in a request.
They bring it up from the warehouse.
Bring what up?
So do you want to start at the beginning or the end?
Both.
We can meet in the middle. Okay.

February 17, 1991.
Does that date mean something to you?
Yeah.
Uh, okay, 10:22 p. m., a noise complaint.
Report of a man screaming and banging on the walls.
Caller didn't leave a name.
It was a low-priority call, so I'm not sure a unit was dispatched.
And then 11:14 p. m., call came from the motel manager.
Overdose.
Uh, victim?
African-American male, early 20s, police and medical were dispatched to the scene, treated subject for suspected heroin overdose and hand lacerations.
(camera shutter clicking) Did he -- Transported to King General.
Alive.
(melancholy music) * I found him.
Hey, you think your mom would be good with that Chinese place on Slauson, or should I be thinking fancier?
No, I'm sure that's fine.
Okay, I'll see you in 20.
ATHENA: Wait, no. Uh...
I forgot to get cream for Mama's coffee.
Could you stop by on your way over and pick some up, please?
EMMETT: And rack up some future son-in-law points?
Absolutely.
(both laugh) I'll see you soon.
That bought us some more time.
BEATRICE: I'm not sure we need it.
The fit is perfect.
Ah.
Oh, he's a good man.
You're gonna have a wonderful life together.
Emmett should've been here by now.
(phone rings) Hello?
Yes, this is Athena Carter.
(sirens wailing) (dramatic music) (indistinct chatter, echoing) * Athena?
Yeah.
I'm Elaine.
I'll, uh, walk you in.
Looks like he walked into a robbery.
Wrong place, wrong time.
* I can have someone drive you home.
No.
Someone needs to tell his mother.
* (dog barking) (footsteps approaching) DENNIS: Boy, don't you open that door.
Get out of here. Can I help you?
Sergeant Grant, LAPD.
Uh-oh.
Which one of my kids is in trouble?
I work with at-risk kids.
I see a lot of you guys.
I figured that's why you're here.
I'm here about the night of February 17, 1991.
(melancholy music) * DENNIS: I remember when the police released this.
I was panicked.
Convinced someone would recognize me.
For months, I was terrified to walk down the street.
I thought they'd send more of you.
I'm not here for them.
I'm here for me.
(sighs) You're her.
Officer Washington is survived by his mother Tina...
and his fiancée Athena Carter.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?
That you memorized his damn obituary?
No. It just...
I wanted you to know that I never forgot about him.
And I never forgot about what I did that night.
Me neither.
You spent months afraid you'd be recognized?
I spent years searching every face I saw.
Wondering was that man the one?
Was his face the last thing that Emmett saw before he died?
(sniffles) You have no idea what decades of not knowing does to a person.
I'm not here for your excuses or your apologies.
I'm only here for your knowledge.
What happened that night?
I was out of my mind.
I was consumed with no thought beyond getting my next fix.
It seemed easy enough.
The store had money. I had a gun.
But he was moving too slow, and my brain was moving too fast.
I didn't even remember pulling the trigger.
He was dead before I knew there was another person in the store.
I woke up in the hospital four nights later.
And that's when I found out I had killed a cop.
I thought they would come for me, but they never did.
You could've turned yourself in.
I told myself that God had given me another chance.
And I took it.
I got clean, and I went to church...
And I tried to live a life of service.
I tried to live a life in service.
For the life I took.
And I know this don't mean much -- It doesn't mean anything.
He was trying to help someone, and you killed him for it.
But you didn't take just one life.
For his mother...
his friends, for me, you were a wrecking ball, tearing through our lives.
But we managed to put the pieces back together.
But there will always be cracks.
I'm sorry.
You claim you're a good man...
now.
But Emmett was always a good man.
Oh, he believed in second chances, too.
He'd be impressed with the life you've built.
But you built it on the back of a dead man, and I, for one, can't get past that.
(sniffles) You have carried my burden for almost 30 years.
It's time you let me take it back.
(static, indistinct chatter) (Beatrice grunts) Oh, God.
Ooh.
Athena.
Ooh.
I talked to that moving company today.
They're coming by tomorrow to give us a quote.
(dramatic music) Oh, my God.
What is this?
Traffic stop gone wrong. Someone got it on video.
They're gonna kill him.
No. Reporters said he's alive.
BEATRICE: I'm glad you're coming home.
I'd hate to have you out there.
I'm not.
I'm not going with you, Mama.
I'm staying here. I'm going back to the job.
What are you talking about?
I joined the force for a reason.
You joined for a man who's dead.
Don't follow him into the grave!
You have no idea who I am, do you?
You're my daughter, and you are not staying here to be a part of that.
That is why I need to stay here.
So there can be more officers like me and less like them.
What difference does that make?
Those cops...
they think they're doing the right thing.
Someone needs to show them that they are wrong.
You're a fool, and I cannot allow you.
It is not your decision, Mama.
And it is not your business.
Okay. We'll be there soon.

Space rocks do not just fall out of the sky onto anybody.
You are gonna be famous.
Okay, instant backboard on three.
One, two, three.
* BUCK: All right, guys, watch your step.
Watch your step.
* I can't believe Hen missed this.
(phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) (solemn music) FRANK: Still not sleeping?
Couple hours here and there, but...
* Every time I-I close my eyes...
You see her face.
I relive the moment.
Last night, it was like...
* I was crashing into her in slow motion...
her injuries happening while the car was crumbling around her.
Wha --what is that?
EDDIE: It's not normal, right?
I have these moments that are good.
We save someone from dying, my kid does something awesome.
It's moments where I should be happy or proud or both.
I know that.
Just don't feel it.
There's no one right way to deal with trauma.
All the first responders I counsel process it differently.
MADDIE: And yet you all ask the same questions and press the same buttons.
I mean, this is my third session...
You're not finding therapy helpful?
I used to.
After Doug died, I did it all: talk therapy, group therapy, cognitive processing.
Spent six months just talking about my feelings.
I'm sorry none of it helped you.
What makes you think it didn't?
'Cause you're sitting in that chair.
I don't wanna be.
I'd rather be at home with my kid, enjoying the one good thing I have going on.
FRANK: So why do you keep coming back?
I was ordered here by my boss.
I know I need help to process this.
I don't want my kid to be like me.
I mean, Chris is always this happy, open kid, ready to share every thought in his head.
But he was in...pain.
He felt like he had to hide that from me, pretend he was okay.
* (sniffles, clears throat) I don't want that for him.
I violated Department policy, violated a woman's trust, and I am really sorry.
I almost killed a guy with my bare hands.
I killed a young girl in the prime of her life.
I survived. Doug didn't.
* (light music) So you still haven't heard anything from the chief about Hen?
I would tell you if they'd made a ruling, Buck -- they haven't.
But shouldn't the investigators be done by now?
We all know it was an accident.
EDDIE: Saw her yesterday.
I was on my way into Frank's, ran into her outside the building.
She seemed okay, just sad.
You can't blame her for that.
Or for anything. BUCK: How's therapy with Frank?
Haven't seen him in a while.
EDDIE: Seems good.
Though I'm not really sure he and I are...clicking.
You should try talking to Rosemary.
I went to her after the stabbing --she was great.
Is that the one I slept with?
No, she doesn't work for the Department anymore.
You slept with your therapist?
I was, uh, going through a phase.
Hey, didn't you just go through one of those?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, everybody.
BOBBY: Hey.
Well, look who's back on the beat!
Just thought I'd stop by, see if there's any word on our girl, Hen.
CHIMNEY: You talk to her?
(cell phone bleeps) No, I try, but all she wants to talk about is -- The girl, yeah, I got that too.
Ooh, ooh, May just sent me a copy of her college essay.
She emailed it to you?
I guess she was too nervous to watch me read it in person.
I remember the drama when my sister was applying to college.
Think that's half the reason why I decided to join the army.
Well, you tell a 17-year-old kid that their future depends on writing 600 perfect words, the pressure's gonna get to 'em.
I don't remember what my college essay was about.
Why don't you call Maddie and ask her what she wrote for you?
(Bobby laughing) I am gonna kill this child.
BOBBY: "Living with the Enemy." I thought her essay was about the tsunami.
So did I. It's not.
Wait, uh, who's the enemy in the essay?
Me.
(solemn music) BOBBY: It wasn't your fault.
System logs show that you pushed the button.
Your light was green when you entered the intersection.
Her light never changed.
Looks like it was the circuit board on the streetlamp.
One of the relays was fried.
You did everything right.
And she's still dead.
But not because of you. I know it doesn't feel that way, that you feel responsible -- Bobby, I'm the one that drove into her.
You can show me a million pieces of paper that --that --that says it's not my fault, but it's still gonna feel like it is.
Did you know she played the cello?
It was an accident, Hen.
* You've been cleared by the Department.
You can return to duty whenever you want.
Um...I don't know when I can come back.
Karen and I are going away for a few days, and, uh...
* I think I'ma need some time.
Take as much as you need.
We'll be here when you're ready.
* ATHENA: "My mother is a police officer.
"It's what's she's been my entire life.
"I never questioned it.
"But lately, answering the question, "'What does your mother do?', fills me with something that feels like shame." Shame? My daughter's ashamed of me?
Um, that's not what she's saying.
You haven't read it.
What?
You did read it.
Well...
You knew she was writing this about me.
(sighs) We discussed it.
She wanted to write about something that mattered to her, but she was worried about your reaction.
Oh, yeah, so she just tells the whole world that her mother is a good-hearted but misguided cop who has wasted her entire life trying to fix a system that's broken beyond repair.
Oh, she also said that she admires you for everything that you've done, everything that you try to do.
What am I supposed to say to her?
The truth.
Now you tell her that you love her.
You're proud of her, even if you don't agree with her.
Come on, Athena, this is the promise that we made.
When we had May and Harry, we promised ourselves -- we agreed that we were gonna raise our children to be strong, smart, and independent, you know, give them room to be their own people.
This essay proves that we have done our job.
That's easy for you to say, 'cause you're not the enemy.
* So how's everything at home?
Better, I guess.
I mean, ever since the crash, Karen has been a rock.
It's like that IVF stuff never even happened.
Well, that's something.
My wife's a project manager.
Looks like I'm her new project.
(laughs) She wants to take me to this new-age-y wellness spa.
She says it'll have healing influences.
Are there gonna be crystals? 'Cause sounds very crystal-ly.
Listen, as long as there's a comfortable bed and nobody trying to talk me into getting a colonic...
(laughs) I'll give it a shot.
And I'll try anything that'll make me feel less awful.
You know, make me feel like I can do this job again.
* You know, someone once told me that the world is full of patients, but what it really needs is more caregivers.
Hen, you are the best caregiver that I know.
So go do whatever you need to do to heal you, because the world needs you back and so do I.
Eh.
Yeah.
Gotta love an early shift.
See ya tonight.
I'll see ya.
Maddie, bunch of us are headed out on the town.
We're thinking karaoke and wings, not necessarily in that order.
You should join us.
We can toast to your triumphant return.
I'm gonna have to pass.
I have plans with Buck.
You sure? He could join.
No, you do not wanna hear Buck sing "Eye of the Tiger." It is painful, even with the one-armed push-ups.
Copy that. Bye.
Bye. (cell phone rings) Tara?
TARA (over phone): Maddie?
(sobs) Maddie, oh, God.
I --I don't know what to do.
What's wrong?
TARA: Can you come over?
Are you hurt? Did Vincent hurt you?
TARA: You were right.
You were so right.
I --I really need your help.
Please.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
(suspenseful music) * (knocking) * Thank God you're here.
(whispers) What happened?
We --we fought.
He --he came after me.
(shaky breath) He was so mad.
Okay, where is he?
I didn't --I didn't have a choice.
(breathing hard) I had to.
You killed him.
I thought I did, but he's still alive.
(gasping) (softly) She --she shot me.
(gasps) (dramatic music) Vincent, can you hear me?
(Vincent gasps) No!
Tara!
You can't. That's why I called you.
To do what?
To stand here and watch him die?
He can't die.
I don't know, I don't know. Should he die?
I can't --I can't think straight.
I need --I need to think.
(gurgling, gasping) Why?
(Vincent gasps) What are you doing?
I'm saving him.
And I am saving you.
Everything in your life gets worse if he dies.
(groans) (Maddie panting) It was --It was self-defense.
It was...
That is what you're gonna tell yourself a million times, but you will never completely believe it.
(panting) Look, I killed my husband.
(wheezes) And I wish that I didn't.
I --I wish I didn't have to.
But you --you survived, though.
I mean, you're --you're free.
* I killed someone I used to love.
I will never be completely free of that.
(Vincent gasps loudly) (groaning) Tara, please, call 9-1-1.
(Vincent gasping) Hey.
(cell phone clicks) WOMAN: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
This is Maddie Kendall, dispatcher badge number 873951.
I have a male in his 30s, GSW to the upper torso.
Don't ask me any protocol questions and don't route me to an EMD.
Be advised there is a loaded firearm at the scene.
WILLIAMS: Police!
Hands up. Hands up, hands up!
Gun.
I need both of your hands up.
(panting) I can only give you one.
SINGER: * Shivers running down my spine *
* And you keep whispering * It's like you're listening (solemn pop music) * To me when I'm asleep * Secret chambers of my heart *
* Carve your name in there * It's like you're always there *
* * With me when I can't breathe * (sirens wail) * I'm a stranger to myself * Becoming someone else * Mm *
* I'm not in control * I'm not in control *
* I'm not in control * I'm not in control *
* I'm out of control * (tranquil flute music) * KAREN: See? I told you it was nice.
Yeah, well, I don't see any crystals, so that's a bonus.
(scoffs) Look, we don't have to stay.
You know, if you just wanna go home -- No. No, no, no.
It's okay.
Honestly, it'll be nice for us to spend a few days away from everything and everyone we know.
You know, just me and you. (chuckles) STACEY: Henrietta?
Henrietta Wilson?
It is you!
Stacey?
Yes!
(Stacey sighs) How are you?
Alive and well, thanks to you.
Stacey Mullins.
I'm --I'm Hen's wife, Karen.
Nice to meet you.
Delighted.
I can't believe you're here.
You have to let me buy you drinks --no, dinner.
Please let me buy you dinner.
Well, uh, you know, we just got here, and, uh, we haven't even checked in yet.
So why don't you give us your room number, and we'll call you when we get settled.
Wonderful. I'm in 209.
(sighs) I can't believe you're here.
Wow.
* Who was that woman?
She's the reason I became a paramedic.
(dramatic music) KAREN: I mean, you don't think it's serendipity running into the life coach whose life you saved?
HEN: You don't believe in serendipity.
KAREN: All right, what else would you call it?
A coincidence.
Yeah, a coincidence that offered to buy us dinner.
We should take her up on it.
Wha --do --you just want me to sit there and have small talk with her?
"Oh, Hen, how's life as a paramedic?" "Oh, well, you know, I saved your life.
"I'm out here, you know, long hours.
I have a great team. Oh, and I killed a girl." You did not kill her!
It was an -- Accident.
(solemn music) That's what everyone keeps saying.
Or maybe that was serendipity too.
Hen.
I'd love it if it was.
If someone could give me a reason why that poor girl is dead and why I just walked away without a scratch.
Please.
Tell me how that fits inside some grand design.
I don't know.
Okay?
But I do know that you did not mean to hurt that girl.
You did everything right. The report said -- I don't remember pressing the button.
The report says I did, but I don't remember doing it.
Okay.
Well, do you remember putting on your seat belt?
Every day, we complete a million tasks just like the day before and the day before that, and we don't remember them.
I don't remember brushing my teeth this morning, doesn't mean I didn't.
But I should remember.
That was an important moment.
Only in retrospect.
When you pressed that button, it was just another day.
No.
I gotta be able to trust myself and my instinct.
That's the only way I'm gonna do the job.
* Finger thoracostomy.
(laughs) It's, uh --it's kinda badass.
Come on, Mads, you saved a guy's life, you know, one who seriously did not deserve it.
No. Nobody deserves to die.
WILLIAMS: Ms. Kendall, sorry to keep you here so long.
You can head home now.
Wait, you don't wanna take my statement?
Detectives talked to Mr. Dagostino before he went into surgery.
He said he shot himself by accident.
An accident?
WILLIAMS: Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I thought too.
You folks have a good night.
(dramatic music) (sighs) I --I don't get it.
Why would he lie for her?
Maddie, I'm so glad you're still here.
I wanted to thank you.
Thank you so much.
Tara, what is -- what is going on?
The officer just said -- He said he could forgive me if I would forgive him, if we could --if we could make things work.
What? No.
It can be different now.
We can be different.
He --he promised.
* You wanna stick around in case she needs you?
No.
I can't help her anymore.
* So she shoots him and then takes him back?
Yeah.
And I thought my marriage was complicated.
How's your sister taking it?
It's, uh --it's kind of rough on her.
You know, I think she thought she could save Tara from Vincent, but, you know, she's realizing that you can't save someone from themselves, not if they don't want it.
Ain't that the truth?
Especially if you aren't around to see that they need saving.
(somber music) Look, I'm sorry I wasn't there, Eddie.
You and Chris needed me, and I had my head so far up my own behind with that stupid lawsuit -- We're way past that, Buck.
I'm not.
I should have been there.
Maybe I could have...talked some sense into you.
(snorts quietly) You talk sense into me?
That'd've been interesting.
I told you not to buy that truck.
Yeah, you'd have talked me into buying something more expensive.
Yeah, fair point.
Look, things got a little out of hand for both of us.
Don't beat yourself up about it.
Why, 'cause you'd rather do it?
Excuse me?
Come on, Eddie.
If you're not gonna be honest with Frank, at least be honest with me.
Who said I wasn't being honest with Frank?
You said you two weren't clicking.
Maybe I'm just not a therapy kind of guy.
Right, right, you, uh --you prefer to work it out in the ring.
There was no ring, Buck. There was a fence.
(chuckles) Come on.
You don't think while you were going through your phase, just maybe, you were throwing your punches at the wrong guy?
Seriously?
You're gonna make it about you, again?
Look, I'm just saying, you were pretty pissed.
Now I thought for sure that day in the grocery store you were gonna take a swing at me.
Not that you didn't deserve it, but I wouldn't do that.
You're on blood thinners.
Well, I'd still take you.
You think so?
I know.
(bright music) You wanna go for the title?
(rock music) Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
ANNOUNCER (on TV): K. O.!
(all shout) (laughs) Yeah! This is my kind of therapy.
(both laugh) One more round. Pick 'em up.
(whooshing on TV) (romantic music) KAREN: I was in the wrong bar.
I spent 40 minutes thinking that my date had stood me up.
(laughs) But then Hen came in.
Serendipity.
I know, I know.
It sounds really woo.
But I gotta say, after my brush with death, I'm kind of open to that.
So you had a near-death experience?
Did you...see anything?
Well, um, nothing supernatural, but I have definitely seen things.
Six years ago, I saw my daughter walk down the aisle.
Four years ago, I saw my first grandchild, last year, my second.
I've seen the world.
I have visited everyone who's mattered to me, and I've told each and every one how much I love them.
KAREN: That's amazing.
STACEY: It is.
And every day, I wake up grateful, grateful for my second chance.
I'm grateful to God, but most of all, I'm grateful to you, Hen.
Thank you for saving my life.
(emotional music) You're welcome.
(truck horn honking) (bell dings) ERNEST: Anticipate. You gotta learn to anticipate.
You gotta have everything in your hand when you hit the ground.
When you hit the ground, you gotta be ready to go.
Time is the enemy. Don't ever forget that.
Yeah, they drilled that into me when I took the job.
The faster the run, the happier the client.
And the happier the bottom line.
Don't ever forget that either.
Hey, protocol says we gotta inspect the cargo on this stop.
I got it. I got it.
Pump the gas.
(mutters) Get the gas.
Young people always get on my nerves.
(tense music) * What the...
Oh, my God.
* You do realize what this run is about.
Company's cutting corners, kid, a lot of 'em.
Take a look at that manifest.
Tell me what you see.
What am I looking for here?
You see any steel drums?
(construction worker yells) Ernest. Ernest, look out!
(tires screeching) * (crashing) ANKUSH: Ah!
(tires screech, truck horn blares) (explosion booms) (people yelling) (bleeps) Which tunnel, sir?
CALLER (over phone): 2nd Street, downtown.
The whole place is filling up with smoke.
Okay.
Can you safely exit your vehicle and get out of the tunnel?
CALLER (over phone): We're trying to help out one of the drivers right now.
Holy crap, there's a combustible sign on the burning truck.
Is this thing gonna blow?
MADDIE: Our concern is your safety, sir.
Let's just get you both out of the tunnel.
JAMAL: No, we have no indication that it's a terrorist attack.
A lot of calls coming in from downtown.
Okay, uh, everybody listen up.
I need you all to initiate traffic rerouting for the area around the 2nd Street tunnel.
Until we know exactly what's burning in there, we're not taking any chances.
Did you say the fire is white?
CALLER: Yeah, It's crazy.
I've never seen anything like this.
(suspenseful music) * (sirens wailing) (horn honks) * BOBBY: Dispatch said two victims and a hazardous materials recycling truck.
I want you to grab the CO2 detection equipment, and I want everybody in full turnouts and BAs --go!
* (dramatic music) * (gasps) BUCK: Cap, that's a bright one.
EDDIE: Put my money on magnesium.
BOBBY: Chim, you're on him. Eddie, Buck, check the driver.
Everybody else, this entire tunnel is an exclusion zone.
Keep people away. Go, go, go!
* EDDIE: Cap, he's pinned. I gotta go to the other side.
BOBBY: Okay.
(radio interference) This is Captain Nash on scene at 2nd Street.
We have a magnesium fire that is reactive to water.
I need a liquid nitrogen truck dispatched immediately.
Copy that, Captain Nash.
Liquid nitrogen en route.
BOBBY: Chim, how's he doing?
CHIMNEY: He's bradycardic, pupils are uneven, GCS 12 and falling.
BOBBY: Smoke's gonna get bad in here.
Get him out of here. Go, go, go!
CHIMNEY: I lost his pulse, starting compression.
(Chimney grunting) (Ankush wheezes) * BOBBY: What are we looking at, Eddie?
EDDIE: He's not impaled or anything, but we're gonna need a jackhammer.
BOBBY: No time for that.
(metallic scrape) (clangs) (saw buzzing) BOBBY: This magnesium's starting to burn real hot.
We gotta get him out of here soon.
(saw buzzes) Saw's not gonna cut it.
Ah! Oh, God!
Oh, my God.
BOBBY: Sir, try to remain calm.
Tell me your name.
Ernest. Ernest...
oh, magnesium.
It's burning.
You need to get out of here.
BOBBY: Sir, it's okay.
We are gonna get you out of this truck.
ERNEST: No.
That's not the only thing there.
BOBBY: What else is back there, Ernest?
Cobalt-60.
You were transporting radioactive waste through the middle of downtown Los Angeles?
Company's cutting corners.
(tense music) This is Captain Nash.
Be advised, be advised.
This truck contains cobalt-60.
Start evacuating this area in a three-block radius and order all nonessential personnel outside the perimeter now.
EDDIE: That magnesium's gonna burn through those drums.
Once that happens, this entire tunnel is gonna turn into Chernobyl.
Hazmat and nitrogen will be here any minute, and I need both of you out there when they land.
Cap!
Buck, it's okay.
I will stay here with Ernest.
I'll get him out of here.
You gotta get out there and put out that fire.
Now. That's an order.
I'll be right behind you. Go!
BUCK: All right, guys, let's go!
Let's go! Come on!
* CHIMNEY: (grunts) Switch.
(suspenseful music) BUCK: Chim!
Where's the hazmat and the nitro?
Delayed, too many cars trying to evacuate downtown.
Cap, no hazmat or nitro yet. We're coming back to you.
BOBBY (over radio): Negative. Negative!
The cobalt has ignited.
We're at gamma radiation level.
I repeat, we are at gamma.
Hold your position.
* That's nuts. Get out of here.
BOBBY: Maybe some CO2 will slow it down before I get that nitro.
(Ernest coughs) (alarm sounds) * BOBBY: That's it, I'm out.
Dispatch, where's that liquid nitrogen?
EDDIE (over radio): Nitrogen's landed, Cap.
It's here.
We need it now!
* BOWMAN: Where's Captain Nash?
Inside!
How long has he been in there?
Too long.
BOWMAN: All right, let's go, guys.
Put it out!
Hey, are you ready?
Come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
* BOWMAN: Captain Nash, you're done.
Gotta get him out of the cab!
I got him --got him.
(alarm sounds) (saw buzzing) * (siren wails) (Ernest coughing) (grunts) The kid --the kid!
You talking about Ankush?
ERNEST: Did he make it?
He's stable.
He's headed to the hospital.
Oh, thank God.
(coughs) (dramatic music) BOWMAN (over radio): Fire's out.
I repeat, fire's out.
Smoke's clear, fallout's gonna be minimal.
(sirens wailing) Maybe not for all of us.
(grim music) * (sirens wailing) * MAN: This way, Captain.
* Thank you.
Okay. Heart function looks good.
And what about the other tests?
So far, mostly good news -- no enlargement of the thyroid, chest X-rays are clear.
Your lungs don't appear to have suffered any ill effects from the exposure.
What about the blood tests?
Kidney and thyroid function are normal.
You said mostly?
The urine test showed trace amounts of cobalt.
Not high, just elevated.
Liver enzymes are also not where I'd like them to be, but I'm not about to sound any alarms yet.
Yeah, but you're concerned.
I'm cautious by nature.
Good, so we won't worry unless you tell us there's something to worry about.
Now, when can I go home?
We'll probably send you home later today.
You can even go back to work.
But we will need that battery of tests once a week for the next six weeks until we are sure there are no long-term effects.
So I'll see you in seven days.
Looking forward to that.
(solemn music) (sighs) I am not ready to be a widow.
Wasn't trying to make you one.
Bobby -- I had to slow down that fire, and the only way I could do it was to get in the path of the smoke.
I didn't have a choice.
It's my job.
(sighs) * You will not get sick on me.
Deal.
Heh.
Love you.
I love you too.
* (Karen groans) Feels like three hours in traffic just undid all three days of rest and relaxation.
I'd say next time we should fly somewhere, but -- Airports.
Mm-mm.
It was a pretty good trip, though, despite the drive back.
(groans) Was it?
I mean, the plan was to recharge and reconnect.
I feel like we only got half that equation, and maybe you got a little shortchanged.
No, I didn't.
I mean, all the stuff Stacey said about living in the moment and being grateful for it...
I am.
I'm grateful for you and for Denny.
I was worried for a minute there.
Yeah.
That maybe we weren't enough.
No.
And I was worried I wasn't enough for you, because I couldn't...
And you could go find somebody else.
I know that most of that was the hormones talking, but, uh...
damn, they're loud.
I never cared about how many kids we had, Karen, just that we had them together.
(murmurs) DENNY: I'm done.
(groans) (Karen chuckles) I'm unpacked. Can we go pick up Paisley now?
Did you put away your stuff?
Or did you just empty it out on the bed?
You only said "unpack." Oh, ho-ho-ho.
Oh, my God.
Three days with Uncle Trey, and he's nailing us on technicalities.
All right, come on. Let's go get the dog.
DENNY: Yes!
(Hen groans) (door closes) (laughs) It is indeed, right?
Hey.
HARRY: You're home!
BOBBY: Oh, this is a surprise. I didn't think I'd get to see you until the weekend.
MICHAEL: I figured you both would be tired after the day you've had.
Thought we'd come by and make you dinner.
Oh, thank you, 'cause I know I'm exhausted.
Are you okay? We saw the driver on the news.
They said he has lung damage, that he could get cancer from being in that tunnel.
Well, he wasn't wearing the protective gear that firefighters wear, and he was in that tunnel a lot longer than I was.
But are you okay?
BOBBY: I feel fine.
ATHENA: Which is what we're gonna focus on, just being grateful that Bobby made it home safe.
They're already talking about massive investigations, State, the Feds, OSHA.
I mean, it's gonna be a big mess.
(Athena sighs) I hope Ernest is ready for it.
He's probably gonna lose his job.
That company is gonna make his life a living hell, what's left of it.
I think he's brave for telling the truth and standing up for what's right.
If more people did that, the world would be better.
(oven timer dings) Uh! That's dinner, okay?
It needs 15 minutes to rest and then we'll eat.
Long enough for me to take a shower with normal soap and water this time.
(solemn music) May.
I wanted to talk to you about your essay.
Wasn't sure if you had a chance to read it.
I'm a police sergeant, not an officer.
I know maybe it seems like it shouldn't mean much, but it does.
I worked very hard for that title.
I'm sorry. I can fix it.
Good.
Then I think it's all set to go out.
It's a powerful essay.
Admissions offices will be very impressed with you.
So you're not mad?
I know you're still trying to figure things out, figure yourself out.
You and I might not always agree on the choice the other makes, but I'm very proud of what I do.
I'm proud of who I am, and I just hope that one day, when you're my age, that you'll be able to look at your daughter and say the same.
That's what I want for you.
* I love you.
I love you too, Mom.
* That wasn't so bad, huh?
I kind of wish she just said she was mad at me.
Oh, welcome to being a grown-up.
(chuckles) (The National's "Fake Empire") * Hey.
Mm-mm. (laughs) Have a good day, sweetie.
* BERNINGER: * Stay out super late HEN: Life hits you head-on, sometimes.
BERNINGER: * Making pies * Put a little something HEN: There's always gonna be pain and the fallout that comes with it.
Thanks to a lot of brave souls, and one in particular, this city dodged a bullet.
But it ain't over.
People need to know what happened.
Today, the real fallout begins.
Sometimes, it feels like the universe is out to get you.
But maybe, it's just trying to get your attention.
Who would have thought that getting hit by a meteor would be the best thing that ever happened to me?
(laughs) I used to have this hole inside me.
But after having an actual hole, I feel whole.
FRANK: I was surprised that you called.
Your next mandated session's not for another week.
I know.
I just really needed to talk.
Okay.
About?
* (shaky breaths) How I really feel about killing my husband.
HEN: We can spend our days trying to understand the pain...
and we should.
That's how we heal.
BERNINGER: * Turn the light out * Say good night * No thinking for a little while *
* * Let's not try ALL: Hey!
(all laugh) Hey, I heard I missed out on some pretty heroic stuff while I was away.
How you feeling, Cap?
I'm just glad to have you back.
BERNINGER: * In a fake empire ALL: Aww.
BUCK: Ah!
HEN: But we must always remember it's not the trauma that defines us.
(alarm blaring) It's how we choose to react to it, how we choose to move on.
Chim.
I'll drive.
* All right!
* (siren wails)
 @@@@@@
CHOIR: * O come, all ye faithful * Joyful and triumphant PEPPER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Excuse me. Hi.
Excuse me, I --I was -- I've been actually waiting for that sp...
(horns honking) CHOIR: * Come and behold him MAN: Excuse us.
PEPPER: Uh, excuse me.
Ouch!
Honestly.
Okay.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for -- it's a duck that dances.
Promotional display on seven.
On seven. Okay.
Where's --where's seven?
WOMAN: Uh, I think they're over this way.
MAN: They're over there. They're over here.
MAN: Move it!
WOMAN: Move, move!
MAN: I see them!
Excuse me.
Ouch. Ow.
WOMAN: Move.
MAN: I saw it first.
Yes.
My kid's better than yours.
Yes! Yes!
Hey!
I got the last one!
Who's the best dad now, huh, Cody?
Yeah!
Hey!
(man yells) Let go of the duck!
Mine!
MAN: That is enough.
(man groans) Stay away!
Stay away! Stay away from me!
Back off!
What is wrong with you people?
This is not what Christmas is supposed to be like!
You people are animals!
MAN: Hold it right there.
Now, get your hands up where I can see them, now.
I'm gonna need you to hand me that pepper spray.
(crowd murmuring) Look, Santa, I...
I just wanted the Dancing Dapper Duck for my little girl, and that is all.
SANTA: I know.
Now just give me the can.
Come on, now. That's it.
You don't want to hurt anyone.
Just give it to me.
That's it right there.
(grunts) (Santa screams) Holy mother...
My duck!
Thank you, thank you so much for saving that.
I mean, at least if I have to go to jail, I'm leaving with what I came for.
Sorry, but that toy is going into evidence.
PEPPER: What?
BOBBY: Sir, this burning is gonna go away.
It's just gonna take a couple hours.
Long before you need to be back in the North Pole.
Is Santa Claus gonna die?
Oh, hey. No, no, no.
Of course not, and don't you worry.
He's not really Santa.
He's not real?
No, no, sweetie. He's just pretend.
Santa's pretend?
That's right.
BOBBY: Buck, Buck, Buck.
Mm-mm.
What?
Did you just tell my kid Santa isn't real?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, no, no.
I was --I was just explaining that this Santa isn't Santa.
(children crying) Hey, Cody, what's the matter?
Santa Claus isn't real.
(children crying) (exhales) (phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) Right.
All right, that's everything in the closet.
All right.
Okay, let's see how much we can get done before your mom and Bobby get back.
Should we even be doing this without them?
It's kind of Mom's thing.
Well, it usually is, but when have you known your mother to wait this late in the season to have her tree up?
Well, it's been a lot this year.
I mean, I don't think anyone's really feeling the Christmas spirit.
And that's why we are going to spread some holiday magic.
All right? And...
Harry, untangle these lights.
You really think a tree is gonna make Bobby forget he might have cancer?
Harry.
What? It's the truth.
Yeah, but we don't think that way in this house.
Okay, this is Bobby's first Christmas with his new family, and we are gonna do everything that we can to make it special for him.
Right?
Okay.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Who's making popcorn?
I'll do it.
(chuckles) (dramatic music) * (door latch clicks) Oh, what's all this?
We got you a tree.
ATHENA: Well, you certainly did.
Oh, it's a beauty.
So how'd it go?
Well, he's not fully in the clear, but thank God this is the last test for now.
BOBBY: They've all been clean, so the doctor says he has no reason to think it'll get worse.
And once we get these results, then we can breathe.
So I hear there are tidings of comfort and joy.
Mm, not quite joy, but we're working on it.
Oh, that's...that's great news.
Hey, you guys, um...
I gotta get going.
You're leaving?
Yeah, I'm afraid so. I got a lot of work to do.
My love? I'll see you.
Bye Okay. Oh, yeah.
My man, my man.
(sniffs) ATHENA: Bye.
* EDDIE: It got ugly.
After I said I had to work on Christmas, he went straight to his room and wouldn't speak to me for the rest of the night.
Mm.
It's just new. He'll get over it.
Abuela's bringing him to my aunt's.
I know he's gonna have a great time.
He just -- last Christmas was...
special.
This one's harder.
Uh-huh.
Is that why you invited us all here?
Trying to cram in as much Christmas cheer between now and then?
Well, thought it'd be nice to bring the boys together for a playdate.
All three of 'em. (laughs) All right, who needs more cement?
I do.
Me.
Denny, we will do you first with this big ol' piece.
Hey, Buck.
Yeah.
Can I spend Christmas with you?
BUCK: I'm sorry, buddy, but I'm gonna be working on Christmas with -- with your dad.
Stupid work.
I promise you.
He'll forget he was even mad by New Year's.
* Is it just me, or does Christmas suck this year?
Definitely not just you.
It's been a rough year...for everyone.
So I'm happy to immerse myself in the magic of Christmas, and I just look forward to putting this year behind me.
I wouldn't be surprised if there's one more smack in the face to come.
DONNA: Maddie, are you okay?
Yeah, I just really wasn't expecting this.
Christmas came early.
Yeah, it is always at Christmas.
Even now, he can't let me have any peace.
I'm sorry, this just feels like blood money.
DONNA: But it isn't.
It's your share of the marital assets.
You're entitled to every penny of that.
How?
I thought I wasn't entitled to anything legally.
The Slayer Statute only applies to murder.
Which you didn't commit. It was self-defense.
Maddie, that money is the least that Doug owed you.
Look, Maddie, I have no sage words of wisdom here.
Keep it, donate it, burn it.
It's your call.
Because according to the state of Pennsylvania, that money is yours.
* (upbeat music) I'm telling you. Destination Christmas?
Greatest idea we've ever had.
I just don't know how Christmassy it's gonna feel for the kids when it's 90 degrees in Hawaii.
Oh, yeah, that whopping five-degree difference from L. A. is really gonna ruin the whole thing.
Next.
Where are we headed today?
Honolulu.
And will you be checking any luggage?
Yes, just these two.
And the clubs.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not letting these babies out of my sight.
Just a little early Christmas gift to myself.
I'll carry these on.
Sir, you can't carry on golf clubs onto the plane.
TSA policy. You'll have to check 'em.
Oh, come on. Really?
Sir. The clubs.
MAN: * All the way home I'll be warm *
* The fire is slowly dying Just...
please be gentle with them.
Uh-huh.
MAN: * But as long as you love me so *
* Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow *
* MAN: Come on, man. Chop, chop.
You know the tracking numbers don't say which one of us sorted the bags, right?
Just toss 'em.
All right? Save us all some time.
Where's your Christmas spirit?
People's lives are in these bags, and they've entrusted them to us.
Any one of them might be filled with presents, and those presents might be -- (shattering) Fragile.
No room left here?
We'll have to wait for another cart.
Like hell we will. Give me those.
No, I -- Holiday hustle, damn it.
Come on.
Oh.
(tires squealing) Whoops.
(upbeat classical music) * MAN: Hey, look out!
(grunts) (gasps) What...
* Oh, my God. My clubs!
* (crowd murmuring) * Yes!
(loud whirring) (laughs) Yeah!
(siren wailing) (dramatic music) MAN: Baggage handler chased a runaway cart into the engine inlet hazard zone.
The aircraft was taxiing.
Both fans were spinning.
These things, they suck in the square footage of a four-bedroom house every second, so...
Buck, Eddie, get me, uh...
everything.
* BOBBY: Officer, you might want to clear this tarmac and that window up there.
Once we open this thing up, it's probably not gonna be very pretty.
Whoa. That's impossible.
Sir, can you hear me?
MAN: We got a live one.
(man groans) Okay, we need to take this thing apart now.
(man groaning) MAN: Let's get that nose off, then we can remove the blades.
Easy, guys. Easy.
MAN: I can see him in there.
He seems to be in one piece.
WOMAN: I don't see a lot of blood.
Okay, very carefully, let's pull him out of there.
(man groans) Easy.
* (applause) MAN: This is unbelievable.
WOMAN: Nothing appears to be broken.
(man groans) What stopped the compressor?
Looks like these got sucked in first.
Locked up the blades.
(cheers and applause) (crowd gasps) Uh, Cap?
* BOBBY: It's just a nosebleed.
Could've been allergies. Could've been the Santa Anas.
Could've been how cold it was out there on that tarmac.
Was this your first nosebleed?
Have your gums been bleeding?
Do you have a rash anywhere I can't see?
What are you doing? Are you diagnosing me?
I haven't noticed any shortness of breath or bruising, but you could be hiding symptoms like a headache, dizziness, irregular heart rate.
Are you?
Buck, I'm not hiding any symptoms, because I'm not having any symptoms of whatever it is you think I have.
That tunnel fire, you were in there way too long.
Okay, that much exposure to radiation can cause aplastic anemia.
Did you know that's what killed Marie Curie?
No, I did not know that.
I also did not know that you knew who Madame Marie Curie was.
Well, I had to look her up.
But she was as really smart lady, and she still died from too much exposure to radiation.
Buck, listen, I appreciate your concern, but I am fine.
So, please, stop with the internet research.
Here is our real problem.
We have a tie for Christmas dinner.
Five votes for burgers and five votes for Chinese.
Five people voted Chinese food? I voted turkey.
Huh. You were the only one.
The falafel place got more votes than turkey.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna switch my vote to Chinese.
I am just not up for cooking Christmas dinner this year.
Ah, fatigue. Also a symptom.
Come here.
Buck, listen.
I know you're worried, but there is nothing to worry about yet.
So as my grandmother always used to say, don't go borrowing trouble.
Bobby, I know...
I do dumb things sometimes and generally drive you crazy.
You're an important person in my life, Bobby, one of the most important.
* I don't know what I would do...
if anything were to happen to you.
* I think that I've moved past him, and then something happens, and he's right back in my life...
in my head again.
Have you moved past him, or just around him?
You've made a lot of progress, but on some level, it feels like you're still defining yourself through Doug.
Old habits, I guess.
I was 19 when we met, so most of my adult life, he...
was my life.
Now isn't it time for you?
I mean, a life that's purely and only Maddie's?
Not a life after Doug, but a life without him.
I don't think I know the difference.
You still refer to him as an active presence.
"He has ruined Christmas. He is in my head." But Doug's dead.
And I'm the one still holding on.
Now, you've said you've done exposure therapy.
Have you been back there?
To Hershey?
To where Doug died.
(scoffs) You want me to go to Big Bear?
To what, relive that nightmare?
I want you to go back to where he hurt you the most and talk to him out loud.
And I want you to let him go.
* (Athena moans) Hey, now.
Mm-mm, mm-mm. Don't be greedy.
(chuckles) (groans) I thought you had a shift.
(snoring) (gasps) Michael!
Hey.
What you doing out here?
Mm.
My ex-husband, he snores.
Come again?
Michael's in there.
In our bed?
Mm-hmm.
Why?
I didn't have the heart to wake him to ask him.
Hi.
Good morning.
Hi, Michael.
Yeah, this is awkward.
You think?
I don't even remember coming here last night.
Have you been drinking?
What? No.
Listen, I've been having trouble sleeping.
And my doctor prescribed sleeping pills.
He said that one of the side effects could be...
sleepwalking.
But sleep-driving?
Who's even heard of that?
Parasomnia.
It's a type of sleep disorder.
People have been known to walk for miles, binge-eat, operate heavy equipment, have sex.
Not that that's what I'm saying happened here.
Well, I would've noticed.
I'm mortified.
You don't need to be. We're family.
But you do need to tell your doctor, because if that's what this is, it could be dangerous.
Yeah, I-I'll do that.
What are you doing?
I just want to make sure that I don't walk into your house or into your bedroom in the middle of the night.
Michael, this is your house too.
No, it's not.
(dramatic music) * I'm sorry.
Very sorry.
Michael.
* So you sure you don't mind calling Athena?
All right, I-I just want to know what she thinks.
I'll give her a call as soon as I get back tonight.
Wait. You guys are still in the car?
MADDIE: Yeah.
Gotta love holiday traffic in L. A.
I'm sorry I'm not there.
MADDIE: Hey, you were there when it mattered.
I'm not sure what you'd be able to do this time.
Truthfully, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
Buck, I'll call you later.
All right. I'll see you soon.
Bye.
(soft music) * (sighs) So what do we do now? Knock?
"Hi, can I come in and relive my trauma?" I think we both know that this is not the place where he hurt you most.
* DOUG: Can't keep running!
Maddie!
(Maddie screams) (both grunting) (blade squelches) I never wanted you to die, Doug...
but I do forgive you.
And I forgive myself...
for loving you too much.
For staying too long.
And for not dying right next to you.
(panting) So today, I'm gonna leave you here.
(inspirational music] * I am gonna run out of these woods, and I am going to live.
I survived you, Doug.
And I will never be sorry for that.
* WOMAN: * Have yourself a merry little Christmas * What's this?
I cooked us dinner.
Mac and cheese with hot dogs, just like Dad used to make us.
Ooh.
Oh, oh, wait. I forgot.
Boom. Pow.
Fancy.
I think Santa's gonna be very impressed with you.
Good. Because I updated my list.
Two pages long?
Don't worry.
I ranked them in order of importance so you can prioritize.
You mean so Santa can prioritize.
Mom, come on. I know.
Know what?
You don't have to keep pretending.
Well, maybe I like pretending.
Why?
Because...
the rest of the year, life is normal.
And then December rolls around, and I don't know if it's the lights or the music or that big guy in the red suit.
I just know that Christmas makes the world feel a little more...
Magical.
(both laugh) Okay. I can pretend too.
(giggles) (gasps) (dramatic music) Uh...
Leo.
Get --get me -- get me a glass of water.
(panting) Mom, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, just...
I just --I just -- I just need to...
I just --I just need to sit, okay?
(mutters) (crash) Mom!
Can you tell me your name and address?
Leo. 2749 Elmer Avenue.
North Hollywood.
Okay. Leo, I'm Maddie.
We're gonna get you and your mom some help.
Do you know what happened?
You said that she fell.
Did she trip, or...
LEO: No, we were talking.
She just fell over.
Is anyone else in the house with you?
Maybe a grownup?
No, it's just us.
Mom, please.
Mom, you have to wake up.
Can you tell if she's breathing?
I don't know. I don't know.
Okay, look at her chest. Is it moving up and down?
No.
MADDIE: I want you to put your cheek against her face, right near her mouth and nose.
Do you feel any air coming out?
No, she's not breathing.
Leo, how old are you?
Um, 10.
All right, paramedics are on their way, but it would really help your mom if someone could do CPR until they get there.
Do you think that you can do that?
I don't know. I'm scared.
I know it sounds scary, but I can talk you through it.
We'll do this together.
Okay.
Put the phone on speaker and set it down on the ground next to you.
Is your mom lying on her back or her side?
Her side.
Let's roll her over so she's lying on her back.
I want you to hold up your left hand and spread your fingers wide, then take your right hand and put it over your left.
Curl those top fingers around your bottom hand, and put it smack in the center of your mom's chest.
Okay.
Okay, now press down as hard as you can until you feel her chest move.
Use all of your weight if you have to.
(panting) Mom. I think I did it.
Leo, I need you to count with me.
One, two, three, four.
BOTH: One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
(cracking) MADDIE: One, two -- I think I heard something crack inside.
I think I hurt her. I didn't mean to.
No, no, no, that means you're doing it right.
You just --you just need to keep going.
MAN: * I'm a thousand miles away *
* It's not snowing in L. A. * One, two, three, four.
BOTH: One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Come on, Mom. Mom, come on.
MAN: * All the flights have been delayed *
* I've got nowhere here to stay *
* But if I can find my way * I'll hurry (siren wailing) * Just hang up the Christmas lights * Hey, it's okay. We've got it from here.
No, the 9-1-1 lady said I have to keep doing this.
And you have done a great job, but your part's done.
Now it's our turn. Come on.
Let's get you some air.
MAN: * I promise * I'm gonna walk No pulse. Starting compressions.
CHIMNEY: It's definitely cardiac.
MAN: * And stop someone * I'll cross the deserts and oceans *
* A river that's frozen * I'll follow the stars just to find where you are *
* You can count on me * Make a wish, close your eyes *
* And believe * I'll be home, home, home, home * Hold CPR.
She's in V-fib.
Gonna shock her. Clear!
She's not converting.
MAN: * I'll cross the deserts and oceans * CHIMNEY: Resume compressions.
HEN: Come on.
MAN: * I'll follow the stars * Just to find where you are * You can count on me She's not converting. Gonna shock her again.
CHIMNEY: Clear!
MAN: * Make a wish * Close your eyes, and believe * Resume compressions.
HAN: Come on, come on, come on.
MAN: * Home, home, home * By Christmas Eve (machine beeping) We got a pulse.
MAN: * I'll find my way * Back to California * I'll follow the map, yeah, to somewhere warmer *
* I'll carry my bags * Just until I can hold you again *
* Oh, I'm gonna walk, if I have to run *
* I'll stand on the highway and stop someone *
* Make a wish, close your eyes *
* And believe * I'll be home, home, home, home *
* Home by Christmas Eve The police officer wouldn't let me go with my mom.
Am I in trouble?
Is it because I hurt her? I didn't mean to.
Of course not.
(somber music) * I just want her to be okay.
You did everything right.
I think you probably saved her life.
WOMAN: Captain, Social Services are on their way.
BOBBY: Copy that.
CAROL: You got it.
I'm sorry. I gotta get back to work.
CAROL: Oh, thanks.
You staying with him?
Yeah, I got him.
Hey.
Merry Christmas, Wilson.
Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
* Come on.
MAN: * Sleigh bells ring * Are you listening * In the lane, snow is glistening * (distorted music) * We're happy tonight * Walking in a winter wonderland * (high-pitched ringing) (glass shatters) * Sleigh bells ring (somber music) * I thought I told you you didn't have to come.
Please.
Like I'm gonna let you Uber home from the hospital.
How did you even get back here?
I told them I was your wife.
What did the doctor say?
They're sending me home.
Well, you said that on the phone.
But what I haven't heard yet is an explanation as to how you ended up walking through a plate glass window.
I got dizzy.
Michael.
This is not an isolated incident.
You've been distracted, you've been stressed, you haven't been sleeping, except when you drove to the house to get into bed with me.
Now you're getting dizzy and walking through plate glass windows.
The doctor don't think these things are related?
Because I do.
I think they're related too.
To me not sleeping.
You know, I'm so sleep-deprived, I'm probably legally drunk right now.
* (Athena sighs) Okay.
Athena.
This is my first Christmas alone.
God.
Michael.
* You're not alone.
You have a family that loves you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you too.
I love you so much.
(sniffs) Look, I-I don't want you to worry about me.
After the holidays, I'm gonna go get a full check-up.
I promise you that, okay?
Okay, good, good.
Come on.
Okay.
* Hey.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Always.
Always.
But the mom's gonna be okay?
Yeah, they put a stent in.
She'll be home soon, just not in time for Christmas.
Oh. So what happens to the little boy until then?
You said they didn't have any family nearby.
Yeah, he'll be in a group home until his mother's released.
Huh.
Okay, one more.
Poor kid.
Doesn't seem like very merry Christmas.
(sighs) Did we mean to buy Denny this many gifts?
(chuckles) Well, I started stashing them in the attic because he was snooping, and I think I lost track of how much I bought.
Do you ever think about where Denny would be if we hadn't stepped in?
Would he have ended up in a group home too?
I don't know. Maybe.
* That kid doesn't know how lucky he is.
Of course not. He's a kid.
Just one more thing to be thankful for this holiday.
BOBBY: My lab results were posted.
And?
Clear across the board.
(sighs) Oh, I can finally breathe again.
Oh, I wish you weren't working tomorrow.
I might actually feel like celebrating the holidays now.
Between weekly trips to the hospital and whatever's going on with Michael, I was about ready to fast-forward to January.
Yeah.
Well, I don't mind working tomorrow.
Christmas Eve has become a much more important holiday now.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
It's the night that you said yes.
(giggles) All right.
You got about five hours till that alarm goes off.
Let's see what else I might be willing to say yes to.
Oh.
(both laughing) WOMAN: * I'll have a blue LORNA: No, Mom, I still can't make it to dinner tomorrow.
It's not like I can eat anything anyway with this frickin' toothache.
I know it's Christmas, but I have to work.
Give me a break.
My mouth is literally killing me.
Yes, I blame you.
I inherited your bad teeth, and that's your fault.
Double root canal for New Year's.
Yay. What am I doing?
Looking for another tube of benzocaine.
I know. I'll already been through -- Huh.
Okay, Mom, I gotta go.
I love you. Merry Christmas.
(grunts) (groans) Oh, thank God.
WOMAN: * You'll be doing all right (alarm beeping) * But I'll have a blue * Blue, blue, blue Christmas (screams) LAFD. Open up, Please.
This is not okay.
Ouch. Jeez.
Okay, ma'am, ma'am, please take a seat and tell us what's going on.
What's going on? Look at me.
I'm a Smurf, and I need a root canal.
HEN: Pulse is steady. Pupils are normal.
How long has this been going on?
The teeth since last week.
The "Avatar" look since I woke up.
And on top of that, I have to go to work today.
On Christmas!
I mean, what kind of loser has to work on Christmas?
Right. Sorry.
Ma'am, do you mind if my guys here take a look around?
LORNA: Oh, that's fine.
You very handsome men, please go look through my messy apartment.
Because this wasn't humiliating enough already.
Okay, ma'am, have you taken any colloidal silver supplements?
What? No.
Any silver-based eye drops?
LORNA: No, no.
Nose sprays?
LORNA: No.
Any medications we should know about?
Benzocaine. Toothache gel.
She used the whole thing.
And a trash can full of empties.
She's seizing.
(Lorna grunting) Okay.
Got her?
I got her.
Could be Methemoglobinemia.
Okay, put her on the CO-oximeter.
* Methemoglobin levels are 60%.
61. Climbing.
Anything over 70 can be deadly.
Hen, get her on 02. Run a fluid line.
CHIMNEY: I'll grab the methylene blue chloride.
EDDIE: It's the benzocaine.

Because, blood thinner boy, Methemoglobinemia causes her blood to appear much darker than normal, which then causes her skin to only reflect blue light, hence, the Smurf lady.

Yes.

In the head or anywhere else.
It feels like something I'd remember, don't you think?
Ma'am, we saw the X-rays.
So did I. And Dr...
Calloway.
Yes, Dr. Calloway.
He seems like a lovely man, but hospitals always make mistakes.
I've heard stories about people having the wrong limbs amputated.
ROMERO: Well, the doctor seems pretty sure, so we need to investigate, find out what might've happened to you.
So the doctor thinks that if you were shot, it would've happened sometime in January, maybe early February.
Did anything during that time period happen that was unusual?
Not really. My life is pretty boring.
It's just me and my husband.
Where is your husband? Is he on his way?
No, he's out of town. Golfing I think.
Maybe Pebble Beach.

I told you Christopher is fine.
You didn't have to come down here.
It's just some scrapes and bruises.

Well, it turns out that Christopher and skateboards don't get along very well.
You let him skateboard?
I am so sorry, Mr. Diaz.
We didn't know one of the kids had brought a skateboard.

No, we're done for the day.
Come on. We're leaving.
But school isn't over.
It is now.
* Uh-huh.
(sighs) Well, I appreciate that, Principal Summers.
Okay. Thank you.
So should I expect some kid's head on a spike at tomorrow's drop-off?
They sent skateboard kid home early.
Principal's gonna meet with the parents in the morning, figure out what the punishment should be.
And what about the kid who fell off the skateboard?
Think I should punish Christopher for getting hurt?
No, but I think you should talk to him about how he got hurt.
I know Christopher wants to be like all the other kids, but -- You want me to tell him he's different?
He already knows that.
You need to teach him what it means.
That he has limitations.
* I'm not gonna tell my kid that.
* Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
Dumb.
What? What are you talking about?
Everybody saw me fall.
People fall. It happens.
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
Mm-hmm, that boy should've never pressured you into getting on that skateboard.
It was my idea.
(laughs) It was your idea to get on the skateboard?
Looked fun. It wasn't.
Chris, why would you do that?
You had to know it'd be dangerous.
You always said I can do anything.
You lied.
* Okay, it worked. You inspired me.
I don't think I meant to, but you're welcome.
I may have reactivated one of my dating profiles.
(gasps) Really?
I spent two hours on the phone the other night talking to a cute guy who seems sweet and funny and not at all like one of those chat room psychos.
Wait, how can you tell?
His profile contains actual sentences with correct grammar and punctuation.
There was even a successfully deployed semicolon.
Ugh, I never use semicolons. I just don't get the point.
Anyway, we're meeting up tonight in a public setting, and I am really looking forward to it.
I just -- What?
I don't want the one-night stand.
I'm tired of being alone.
Aside from my coworkers, the most meaningful relationships in my life are made 10 minutes at a time with people I'll never see or talk to again, some of whom don't survive.
It sounds silly, but he calls, and I'm excited to answer the phone for the first time in a long time.
I don't think that sounds silly at all.

And I thought the new baby went everywhere.
This is not the fairytale romance I had in mind.
So what, bad date and you were trying to escape?
No, there was a whole Lemony Snicket level of things that went wrong here.
She clear of the door?
Sure is, Cap.
Do what you gotta do.
* TESSA: Oh, God.
He's never gonna wanna see me again.
I'm sorry. I'll pay to fix that.
Okay, guys, let's try to gently pull her through.
BOBBY: Ma'am, I need you to exhale.
Okay.
BOBBY: Okay, stop.
She's not gonna come out the way she went in.
Cap, this is original wood.
We can't just poop out the top panel.
Pop.
We, uh, can't just pop out the top panel.
Sorry.
We have to take apart the frame.
Guys, we're gonna need the saws.
You're gonna cut the window?
This just keeps getting worse.
Ma'am, just try to stay calm. How's she looking, Hen?
Vitals are good. Just breathing a little heavy.
Are you in pain?
No, but has anyone ever died of actual shame?
I'm sorry, Gary.
This is not how I wanted our first date to go.
It can only get better from here, right?
I've always wanted a bay window.
He's probably never gonna wanna speak to me again, and you have no idea how hard it is to meet someone these days.
BUCK: Oh, believe me, as a fellow solo, I know.
Eddie might've finally met someone special.
Then he went and bit her head off.
Now she'll never talk to him again and will probably flunk his kid.
* Well, you kinda did.
MAN: Saw's on its way up, Cap.
Are you guys using a saw?
* (wood cracking) BUCK: All right, guys. We got her out.
Can you take a deep breath for me?
(inhales deeply) Any pain in your ribs?
I'm okay.
You good? All right.
* I'll call a Lyft.
Oh.
Or you --or you could stay.
SINGER: * So please meet me in the plaza *
* Near your casa * I am only one * And that is one too few * On an evening in Roma Pretty sure all kids call their parents liars at some point.
Yeah, well, feels a little different when you hear it coming out of your kid.
Just wait till he gets to the "I don't have to do what you tell me" phase.
Aren't you still in that phase?
The thing is, he's right.
I lied to him.
Or maybe I lied to myself.
Either way, I feel like a fool.
I spent years trying to convince my kid to believe in the Easter Bunny.
But now I gotta tell him none of it's real.
Yeah, I think you might be overcorrecting here.
Told him he's no different than the other kid.
But he is. He has CP.
There's a lot he can't do.
Have you ever heard of Jim Abbott?
Baseball player?
Mm-hmm.
Pitched a no-hitter in the '90s, which in itself is pretty crazy, but it's even crazier if you know that Jim Abbott was only born with one hand.
Yeah, really.
I read his book when I was in the hospital.
Okay.
How'd he do it?
He practiced switching his glove to his throwing hand relentlessly so that he could field after he pitched.
I like the positivity.
I'm just not sure how any amount of practice is gonna help Chris stay on a skateboard.
(dramatic music) * I'm not an invalid, you know.
I can still get groceries for myself.
I'm doing something nice.
Say thank you.
Ooh. Thank you.
Huh. You're welcome.
So what's happening now with your bullet lady?
They removed the bullet this morning, so just waiting on ballistics to give us a clue to something.
Well, what about the husband?
* ATHENA: Claims he has no idea how his wife got shot.
I love you.
I love you too.
I love you more.
ATHENA: He actually tried to interrogate us.
Yeah, the best defense is a good offense.
What about his alibi?
Well, we don't even know when she was shot.
I mean, without a specific timeline, we can't prove anything.
And the wife still doesn't suspect him at all?
ATHENA: They say love is blind.
But in this case, I think willfully so.
* I mean, she went from having a great memory to forgetting the name of the doctor that she met an hour ago.
Never prone to headaches, but now she chewing aspirin like they breath mints.
I mean, her whole life fell apart.
But she chose not to seek help for months.
Well, maybe she just can't believe the man that she married could ever hurt her.
Hell, he's her husband. She thinks she knows him.
Yeah, sometimes you don't know who you married to, and sometimes, they don't want you to know.
The truth eventually comes out, though.
But maybe with this, it'll come out with your bullet.
Hmm.
Yeah.
You know, the surgeon said that taking it out wasn't that hard.
I mean, they were worried about the location of the bullet, the risk of taking it out, but as it turns out, she's just fine.
(both laugh) Oh, Athena.
Well, you know, now I finally know the motive of the groceries.
Look, I am not having this conversation again.
I am not doing that surgery.
So you're just gonna wait to die.
(sighs) I'm going through another bout of radiation.
The doctors put my name on a list for a trial for this new chemotherapy pill.
You know, it's showing some promise for shrinking tumors.
How much promise?
Look, I know that you think -- That you are a fool.
Look, I wanna be supportive, Michael, I wanna respect your wishes, but...
* I do not want you to die.
Me either. Okay?
* (phone dings) (sighs) * Oh, ballistics just came back. They found a match.
Does the gun belong to the husband?
Worse.
It belongs to the wife.
(laughter) FRANKENSTEIN: Seem to be quite a few books.
BLUCHER: This was Victor's.
His parents' medical library.
FRANKENSTEIN: And where is my grandfather's private library?
BLUCHER: I don't know what you mean, sir.
FRANKENSTEIN: Well...
(romantic music) * (phone whooshes) (laughter) Stay close to the candles.
Greg?
You must be Josh.
It's really nice to meet you.
As first dates go, I gotta admit you chose well.
You know, you don't usually think of the cemetery as a romantic place for a date, but it's quaint, kind of kitschy, and there are plenty of exits in case one of us turns out to be too sketchy.
I figure there is nothing more romantic than watching an old movie snacking on the graves of the people who used to make them.
Thank you.
If the zombies rise up, we'd be eaten by all the silver screen starlets and screenwriters.
(both laugh) I love it.
Cheers.
Cheers.
* Do you understand?
I understand, I understand.
(both laugh) And you like it there? It's not too stressful?
No, it's unbelievably stressful.
But how many jobs can you go home at the end of the day and feel like you've made a difference?
I'll never be rich. I'll never even be recognized.
But I'll be...
worthwhile.
You know, I remember when going to the movies was about making out in the back row.
I heard Rudolph Valentino's grave is somewhere around here.
Maybe in the back row.
* This is exactly what I said I wouldn't do on a first date.
Oh, come on. This is the fun stuff.
MAN: Took you long enough.
(tense music) Uh...
okay, I don't know what you guys are into, but it definitely doesn't feel like my scene.
You know, for somebody who spends their days listening for clues, you sure managed to miss all of 'em.
(grunting) No. Please.
Hey, I'm not the one who went online begging somebody to play me.
(grunting and screaming) * Let's go.
MAN: Hey, what's going on over there?
(machines beeping) Oh, my God.
Josh, are you okay?
I'm okay.
What happened?
I got jumped.
They took my keys, my phone, my wallet, beat the crap out of me.
For a minute there, I...
I thought they were gonna kill me.
Was this after your date? The movie thing?
It was my date.
He was the one.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
He set me up.
Him and his friend. I never even saw it coming.
I am an idiot.
I thought he was sweet.
That he liked me.
No.
You just trusted the wrong person.
(knocks) BRANFORD: Mr. Russo?
We had officers canvass the cemetery.
There's still no sign of your phone, but they recovered your keys and your wallet.
I'm afraid the cash was gone though.
At least they saved me the hassle of replacing all my credit cards and IDs.
BRANFORD: You can pick up your things at the station.
A detective will take your formal statement then.
Does that have to happen tonight?
I'm just really worn out.
Well, you know what?
You can just stay with me tonight and I'll drive you to the station in the morning.
BRANFORD: Of course. Tomorrow is fine.
Are you sure you didn't recognize either man?
No identifiable features?
No. Sorry.
BRANFORD: Look, we'll do our best, but I need to set your expectations.
No, I know the drill.
If it's okay, I'd like to get out of here and just put this whole night behind me.
Call us if you think of anything else.
Thanks.
Josh.
I already feel like a fool.
I don't need the rest of the world in on the joke.
Okay.
(tense music) * ATHENA: Nothing?
No sign of the gun.
Or any gun.
No ammunition, no gunshot residue, no blood.
The house is immaculate.
Ha!
* Ma'am? Hi, LAPD.
May we speak to you a moment?
I don't see why not. Just doing a little yard work.
Yes, Detective Romero was remarking on how lovely your yard looks.
Being out here does take up most of my day.
Oh, I'm sure you see everything that goes on around here.
I am also the president of our neighborhood watch.
I take that responsibility very seriously.
Mm.
How well do you know the Wallaces?
We wave occasionally. I always liked Joan.
Never that sure about Henry.
Then he retired, and I finally was able to make up my mind.
I don't like the man.
Between you and me, I'm not sure Joan does either.
They weren't getting along?
You know, people used to retire at 65 back when life expectancy was 68.
Now, it's all early retirement and late life divorce.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what any of this has to do with the break-in.
Someone broke into their home?
I assumed that was why you all were here.
Though honestly, you are a little late to the party.
That must've been three months ago.
Did the Wallaces tell you they'd had a break-in?
No. Their contractor did.
That window there was replaced.
The contractor hauled away some furniture and a rug, a bunch of Christmas decorations.
Said he painted and redid the floors too.
Redecorating the crime scene?
That's why we couldn't find anything.
Didn't see Joan or Henry for weeks.
They were out of town.
Do you remember when all of this happened?
January 11th.
Would you like the contractor's information?
Yes. Then I'd like to hug you.
(chuckles) I think it'd be best if Mr. Wallace stepped outside.
That's silly. Henry should stay.
My memory is terrible. Maybe he can help.
You can have this back. We made a copy.
Thanks.
I was wondering where that had got to.
ATHENA: When we were looking through it, we noticed that there didn't seem to be any entries about your trip, or the living room remodel.
(dramatic music) Did we remodel the living room?
No, that's right. We did.
I just don't remember why, though.
We just finished the house last year.
Why did we redo the living room?
Do you remember what happened on January 11th?
Maybe you were taking down Christmas decorations?
No, we always take those down right after New Year's.
(music intensifies) (man shouting indistinctly) * Henry, what happened to that rug?
Oh, I loved that rug.
Why did we replace it?
There was an accident.
* JOAN: (breathing heavily) (man shouting indistinctly) Henry...
* What did you do?
* What did you do?
* (indistinct news report) I thought you were gonna take down those wreaths for me.
In a minute.
JOAN: No more minutes.
We should've put all this stuff away last week.
What happens if we don't?
Does the world come screeching to a halt because the wreaths are up past MLK Day?
I don't know why you're like this.
I miss when you used to work for a living.
Yeah, well, you've never worked a day in your life.
Oh, the hell I haven't.
I have taken care of this house and I've taken care of you for the last 30 years, and all I ask is that you -- And all you have asked is that I work 60-plus hours a week to support you and this house and whatever ridiculously expensive hobby your heart desires.
Ceramics class?
(ceramic shatters) Henry, what did you do?
Do you know how hard I worked on that?
No, but I know how much it cost me for you to learn how to make something that I could buy for 20 bucks!
Glass-blowing lessons!
(glass shatters) What are you doing?
This is my time!
My retirement!
And I'm not gonna let you rule my golden damn years the way you rule the rest of my damn life.
(wood crashes) * Fine.
(quietly sobbing) I will deal with the decorations myself.
I always thought when you retired, it would be our time.
Our time together.
* I know you're upset about something, but I'm your wife, so you're stuck with me.
* (glass shatters) JOAN: You shot me.
* I don't know what came over me.
The thought of 30 more years in that house with you, and I -- * Call it temporary insanity.
Well, you are certainly within your rights to make that case to a judge.
I'm sorry, Joanie.
I regretted it immediately after I did it.
I tried to make it up to you as best I could.
After.
You lied to me.
All this time, you knew what was wrong with me, and you kept telling me it was all in my head.
Well, I guess it was, because you put it there.
* Now, you're gonna be okay.
He played me for a fool.
And you just showed him that he was wrong.
Chris. Come on, buddy.
Eat something before school.
I don't feel well.
You sick?
Hmm.
You sure?
I don't wanna go.
Okay.
(grunts) (solemn music) * You still upset about the other day?
I just wanna be like everyone else.
I know.
But you're not.
I know I told you you can do anything, and that was a dumb thing for me to say.
Because I have CP.
No.
Because...
Nobody can do everything.
And yes, there are things in life that you're not gonna be able to do.
And there's other stuff that you are gonna be able to do, but it's gonna be a lot harder than it is for the other kids because you have CP.
I'm sorry. I won't skateboard again.
It's not about the skateboarding.
I just don't want you to be scared.
You tried something, and it didn't work out.
Maybe the next time it does.
But you can skateboard.
You know what I can't do?
Cook?
(laughs) Hey, that's not nice.
But probably true.
I have black thumb.
I've killed every plant that's ever been given to me.
But your science teacher told me that you did the best job out of your whole class growing plants from seeds, so there's something you're better at than me.
Really?
Really.
I don't want you to ever stop trying.
But maybe...
until you get a little older, maybe we try new things together, okay?
Okay.
You're not like any other kid.
You're my kid.
I love you more than anything in this world.
I love you too, Dad.
Aw. Mwah.
* Sorry, is this a bad time?
Mr. Diaz.
Eddie.
Please.
I wanted to apologize for the other day.
I was out of line and you didn't deserve that.
You had every right to be upset.
It's my job to look after your son and I failed to do that.
I'm just relieved Christopher is okay.
Yeah, I fight so hard to try and protect him, I forget falling down is a part of life.
It's supposed to teach us how to get back up, right?
Yes.
There's a lot to be said for getting back on the horse, but there's also some value in learning that you don't like horses.
I'm sorry?
Sometimes, our limitations tell us when to stop.
But sometimes, they can show us where to look next.
Today, he falls off the skateboard.
But tomorrow, he writes the great American novel.
I know you said he was doing good in class, but -- (laughs) Okay, maybe not tomorrow, but...
Someday.
Yeah.
Someday.
(elevator dings) MADDIE: Welcome back!
(all cheering) Thank you.
If I'd known I'd get this much attention, I would've gotten mugged sooner.
(laughter) Hi.
Ah, there he is.
Good to see you, thanks.
Hey, welcome back, Josh.
Good to see you.
Thanks.
Josh, you're back!
Okay.
You didn't tell them. Thanks.
You asked me not. I'm still not sure why.
This was not your fault.
I should've known better.
It's not too late to go back to the police.
You know, I tried to pull up his profile, get a copy of his photo, but it's gone.
Completely scrubbed. It was a total scam.
Yeah, that probably means he's done it before.
If you could get them a description of him, maybe they could find him.
I mean, he hurt you.
Bruises are healing.
The humiliation, that's a little harder to get over.
And to have it written down in some report for strangers to see?
I can't, Maddie.
So what, you're just gonna act like it didn't happen?
No, I'm not.
I'll deal with it.
In my own way.
(Noah and the Whale's "Blue Skies") (phone ringing) * 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
SINGER: * This is a song for anyone * And can I get your location?
SINGER: * With a broken heart Okay.
(both laugh) Nice.
Yeah.
SINGER: * This is a song for anyone *
* Who can't get out of bed *
* 'Cause it's time to leave * Those feelings behind (knocking) * Oh, 'cause blue skies are coming * Thought you could use some carbs.
SINGER: * But I know that it's hard * (laughs) * Dad, I don't wanna be here.
Trust me, it'll be fun.
BUCK AND CARLA: Hey, Chris!
Surprise!
What's that?
Hey, remember when I told you that if you wanted to try something new, we should try it together?
Yeah.
Let's try skateboarding.
Okay.
Okay!
* Ready to ride?
Ready!
Away we go.
(all cheering)
 @@@@@@
(upbeat rock music) Okay, so I fixed the black lights, cleaned the men's room, called to restock the pizza supply, and rebooted the scoring system, twice.
Yeah, but have you been spraying down the shoes?
On it.
You're a treasure, Garrett.
Know what else I am?
Manager material.
So that's what this is about.
You're gunning for Jesse's job.
Does Jesse know he has a job?
He comes very highly recommended.
By his parents.
What could I do?
She's my sister.
Lane five is down.
What's wrong with it?
Yeah, lane five's been jamming a lot lately.
It's cool, I'll just check the pin setting.
No, no, no, you've been here a whole shift.
Go home. I'll take care of it.
You know, Arlene, if I had more responsibility -- Hey, hey, hey, you're a great kid and you're my best employee but you're only 17.
You're not ready yet.
I'll be 18 soon!
In 10 months.
We can revisit this talk then.
Now get out of here and go be a kid.
Okay, boomer.
And stop calling me boomer!
Jesse, I'm gonna go fix lane five.
Put the sign out, and finish spraying down these shoes.
Uh-huh.
(Portugal. The Man's "Feel It Still") * Hey.
Our scoreboard isn't working.
Can we change lanes?
Mm-hmm.
Thanks! We're gonna take five.
* SINGER: * Can't keep my hands to myself * Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
SINGER: * Think I'll dust 'em off *
* Put 'em back up on the shelf *
* In case my little baby girl is in need *
* Am I coming out of left field? *
* Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks now *
* I been feeling it since 1966 now *
* Might be over now but I feel it still * (distant cheering) * Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks now *
* Let me kick it like it's 1986 now * (players cheering) * Might be over now but I feel it still *
* Got another mouth to feed * Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the grave digger *
* Gone with the fallen leaves *
* Am I coming out of left field? *
* Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks now * What the -- (screaming) SINGER: * Might've had your fill *
* But I feel it still * Let me kick it like it's 1986 now *
* Might be over now but I feel it still * (screams) (dramatic music) Hey. Are you in charge here?
I guess.
Thank God you're here! She's this way.
Okay, her name's Arlene Branson.
She's the owner. She was working on lane five when the pin setter came down on her.
I wasn't sure what to do, so I shut off the power to stop it from cycling again but I didn't think I should move it until you guys got here.
Okay.
ARLENE: Help!
(Arlene moaning) * Arlene?
Garrett?
It's okay, Arlene. I'm here.
These people are gonna help you, okay?
All right, I got a compound fracture, more outside than in.
Pulse is very weak.
She's lost a lot of blood.
Let's get fluids going.
All right, do you know how to move this thing?
How to release it?
Not really.
I've only watched Arlene do it.
Manual.
Right, manual release.
Which is here somewhere.
We could take it apart piece by piece.
Not sure what that's gonna do for her arm.
* Here.
Put this in the back, then turn it.
Blood pressure's dropping.
Pushing fluids through.
I'll get the tourniquet, tie the arm, and get her out.
I don't know if that's gonna work.
Right now, this cross brace is the only thing that's holding her arm in place.
The minute you move it, she's gonna bleed more.
And given how broken her bones are, it'll be like tying off a wet bag of rocks.
What if we embrace the cross brace?
We cut her from the pin setter here, then we weld these points here, here, and here, and you've got a -- Damn good splint.
All right, we're gonna need a stick welder.
(Arlene grunting) * BUCK: Stop.
Go.
(Arlene moans) BUCK: Stop.
Nice and easy. Three, two, one.
(Arlene screams) Ow! Ow!
(yelping) * All right. Okay.
(yelping) * (as the Terminator) Living tissue under a metal endoskeleton.
You know, technically, it would be an exoskeleton, right?
Can't just let me enjoy the win.
Good job, bud.
Thanks.
You too, Garrett.
Garrett.
Arlene. Are you okay?
Refunds.
No refunds.
Give everyone a coupon for another visit.
I'm gonna be out of commission for a while.
You're in charge.
Manager.
* Jesse?
Yeah?
You're fired.
(phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) * She's down.
Oh. (laughs) Listen, you know, I appreciate your effort, Hen, but I'm not really a green tea kind of guy.
Just drink it.
Studies suggest that the EGCG in green tea can boost the effectiveness of the temozolomide.
So this tea can make my chemo drug work better on my brain tumor?
My new favorite beverage.
(both laugh) See?
(groans) Not that terrible.
Yeah, I wouldn't go that far. (clears throat) But, you know, thank you for the tea and the loaners.
I'm not sure what happened to our tents.
You know, got lost somewhere in the move over here.
Are you sure you should be going on this trip?
It's a tradition.
ATHENA: It's foolish.
The man has a brain tumor.
Camping can wait.
Wait, Dad's taking Harry camping?
He has a brain tumor.
Yes, he does, and I'm pretty sure that's why he asked me to go with him.
Yes, Bobby is an EMT, but he's not a doctor.
MICHAEL: Which is fine, because my actual doctor cleared me for this trip.
Kay?
Hen.
This is important, okay?
I need to do this.
Michael doesn't wanna disappoint Harry.
It's just camping.
I never understood why he had to make such a big deal out of it.
They can go next year.
Assuming there is a next year.
I have taken him every year since before he can even remember it.
I need to make sure that this time is memorable.
In case there isn't another.
Look, I know there are no guarantees, but, I mean, the surgery at least offered us some more time.
That's all I'm looking for right now.
Well, maybe the chemo gives us that.
It's too soon to know for sure.
Yeah, and by the time we do know, it may be too late for the surgery.
This is all my fault.
Baby, no.
I told him that there was hope and that he had choices, but I never meant for him to -- No, no, no, you did not tell him not to have the surgery.
All right? That was his idea.
Which we said we'd support.
No, you said that.
I still haven't given up on the idea of knocking some sense into him, but whatever happens, this is not your fault.
* By the way, I got into USC.
(gasps) May, that's great.
* (Albert giggles and shushes) Albert.
You are not Albert.
Chimney. Hi, hey.
I did not think you'd be up so late.
I could say the same about you and your friend.
(laughs nervously) Megan. Hi.
You didn't tell me you had a roommate.
Well, technically, he doesn't even have a room.
Just a sofa, which I'm kind of regretting letting him live on right now.
Do you have a place I could change?
There's a bathroom down the hall.
* I'm sorry.
I should've called and warned you but it was all just so spur of the moment, you know?
We met at this club, we started talking, and things, they simply ignited between us.
On my couch.
Where else?
It's my bedroom.
It's also my couch.
Why are you upset?
Because you brought some rando club girl to my home and you ignited yourself all over my living room.
Bro, did you not see how pretty Rando Club Girl is though?
I mean -- FYI, Rando Club Girl is actually working on a PhD in applied mathematics.
My apologies, Doctor.
I did not mean to disparage you.
I was aiming for him.
Apology accepted.
Nice to meet you both.
* I really wish I'd gotten her number.
Albert, should I be worried about you?
I mean, you've been going out an awful lot since you got here and a different woman every night?
Yeah, well, I feel as though I'm the one who should be worried.
Yo, you never go out. Only for work.
You're with the same girl every night.
You're either there or here.
Yeah, well, that's about to change after I burn your bedroom in a cleansing fire.
And what exactly is wrong with the same girl every night?
What, you don't like Maddie?
I like her very much.
She's a good friend to you.
(laughs) Well, she's a lot more than that.
Is she?
Well, I'm saying I see the friendship.
I'm not so sure if I see passion.
Do you guys even have sex?
(laughs) Of course we have sex!
We had sex...three nights ago.
Oh, I did not notice.
Yeah, you weren't supposed to, Albert.
I, uh, I did not mean to offend you.
As long as you're happy, then I'm happy for you.
* Well, I am happy.
Of course I'm happy.
BOBBY: How long have you guys been camping at the same place?
I don't know.
I started going with my father when I was 6, 7.
Wow.
MICHAEL: Yeah.
You always plant a tree?
Ah, no.
Trees came later.
HARRY: There was a fire.
Most of the trees burned down.
Dad was sad, but Grandpa promised that they would all grow back.
He said it wouldn't be the same but -- both: It would still be beautiful.
(Michael laughs) Yeah, my dad would say, "Hey, just plant it, let it grow, and stay out of its way." (laughter) Yeah, we used to go up there every year.
Plant a few trees at a time.
(solemn music) Then Harry and I kept the tradition going after my dad passed.
And now you get to do it too.
(Michael laughs) * (groaning softly) Oof.
Hey, uh, Bobby, maybe you can take over driving for a bit.
Yeah, sure.
All right.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, man.
Come on, I'm great. (ahem) * CHIMNEY: But am I happy?
Albert is annoying, but maybe he's right.
Things with me and Maddie are great, but we're not exactly lighting the world on fire.
Does it matter what he thinks?
Only you know how you feel about Maddie.
I really care about her.
HEN: Ah.
The dreaded C-word.
I really care about good arch support.
That's not how you feel about your significant other.
Obviously, I care about her more than good footwear.
Okay, how much more?
A lot.
Do you love her?
(sighs) Yeah.
Does she love you?
It's unclear.
I mean, I feel like she does, but neither of us have actually said those exact words out loud.
You've been together for, like, a year.
Technically, we have been dating for 10 months and 3 weeks.
So you've been together for, like, a year.
(laughter) With everything she's been through, you know, that we've been through, we just wanted to take it slow.
(laughs) HEN: Jesus.
Glaciers move faster, Chim.
And they're also melting, so maybe fiery is overrated.
Hey, guys? Reynolds wants to do a lineup.
I can't believe Cap left us with this guy.
I sure wasn't gonna do it again.
Hey.
I get taking things slow.
But tomorrow isn't promised to anyone.
So if you love her, tell her.
* You went out for coffee?
Yeah, I got you one of those frothy ones you like, made almost entirely of milk and sugar.
I called Tammy.
She's able to fit us in at 11:00 to get our nails done, and then I thought that I would take you to lunch.
At the burger place over by USC.
Mom, I don't want you to -- No, I'm not trying to sway your decision.
You know, I know there are a lot of colleges you still haven't heard from.
Although I wouldn't mind at all if you decided to follow in my footsteps.
Either way, I am very proud of you.
So we are gonna celebrate your first acceptance letter, whether you like it or not.
Kay.
Maybe after lunch we can go to the mall?
We can celebrate with some new clothes.
You say yes to USC, I may buy you a whole new wardrobe.
So much for not trying to sway me.
(laughs) (sighs) I haven't told Dad yet.
(sighs) You will.
All right? He'll be back soon.
You still have time.
* Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
Ah, no. I got it, I got it.
(grunts) Oh, man.
All right, I think that's everything.
All right, ready to pick our planting site.
Last time, we went East, so I was thinking maybe we can go South, Southwest, and North.
Okay. Yeah, that --that sounds good.
Just give me a few minutes to lie down.
But we always pick the spot when we get here.
It's tradition.
Well, maybe this year, we start some new traditions.
Hey, hey, hey. Don't need any new traditions.
Just give me an hour. Please.
(grunts) He said he'd be fine for a year.
It's only been a month.
I think he just needs a second to rest.
We can pick that spot in the morning.
That's too late.
It takes time to find the perfect spot.
That's why we always do it when we get here.
How are we supposed to plant Grandpa's tree?
Hey, Harry, how about this?
How about you and I take a walk, find some places to plant that tree, we'll take some pictures, show your dad, and he can decide.
Sound good?
Yeah, okay.
Good. All right, come on.
Which way should we go?
That way? All right, let's do it.
* All right, Dad. I'm back with the supplies.
RON: Hey.
Hi.
Looks pretty good, huh?
Yeah, this is taking a lot longer than I thought it was going to and requiring a lot more trips to Home Depot.
Right tools for the right job.
Mm.
Once we finish the framing, then we can start drywalling your new interior non-load bearing partition.
It's just a wall, Dad.
Yeah, I just need something to break up this modern floor plan and hide the view of my dirty dishes from the couch, so -- open concept only works if you have a maid.
Ah. Well, closed concept it is.
Mm.
We land the nails, then we turn the screws, and that way, we meet code.
Wait, I thought you said we didn't have to worry about building codes.
You said I didn't need a contractor.
And I thought the whole point of your mother and I helping you buy an already remodeled house is that we wouldn't have to remodel it, but here we are.
So humor me.
Great.
Hey, hey, hey. You forgetting something?
Dad, come on. We're just framing a wall.
We're not splitting the atom.
Just put 'em on.
Fine, fine.
Hey, I promised your mom we'd be extra careful.
Great.
(sighs) Now.
All right, here we go.
Yes.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.
Just like a real gun, you never point it at anything you don't intend to shoot Okay?
Okay.
So two hands.
Right.
Put it right in the middle of the stud.
Yup.
Right there, okay?
Yup.
Apply firm pressure.
Squeeze the trigger.
(nail gun fires) Yeah!
Oh, yes!
That is cool.
Right? See?
Okay, keep going. No more than an inch apart.
Okay.
Okay, it's not -- What's going on?
I don't know. I didn't do anything.
Damn things.
I swear, ever since I let Mitch borrow my tools, these things don't work right.
(click) The whole thing's jammed!
Geez.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Okay, just hang on.
(nail gun fires) (dramatic music) Oh, my God. Dad?
* Um...
you better call 9-1-1.
* Where are you calling from?
KENDALL: 13924 Rio Avenue, North Hollywood.
What can you tell me about the gun?
It's a pin nailer.
It's a framing nailer!
It was a nail gun. It got stuck.
He was working on it and it just went off.
And the nail's embedded in his chest?
Yes, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I don't know. Do I pull it out?
MADDIE: No! Do not remove the nail.
Help is on the way.
(sirens wailing) Thank God you're here. He's in the back.
Dad, help's coming!
(grunts) That thing still on?
KENDALL: Yeah.
I don't know. I was too afraid to touch it.
I'll secure the weapon.
Hey. How are you feeling?
Like an idiot.
If it makes you feel any better, this happens a lot more than you think.
Blood pressure is low. Pulse is steady.
I'm gonna clear your shirt so we can see what we're working with, but it looks like you hit the bull's eye.
(grunts) BUCK: Yeah, bring that gurney in here.
Yeah, that's good. Bring it around.
Sir.
BUCK: Careful.
CHIMNEY: Take a few deep breaths for me.
(exhaling deeply) Lungs sound clear, but I'm getting a muffled heartbeat.
We've got a distended neck vein.
We could be looking at pericardial tamponade.
I'll alert the hospital.
Sorry, pericardial what?
Fancy way of saying he has fluid around his heart.
Guessing that's not supposed to be there.
No.
We're gonna need to get you to the hospital for a pericardiocentesis.
That's where they'll drain the fluid.
Yeah. Okay. Let's do that.
CHIMNEY: All right, we're set.
What hospital are you taking him to?
First Presbyterian on Ventura.
Hey, Dad, listen, I'm gonna go get Mom, okay, and we're gonna meet you there.
Do not tell her what happened!
Oh, my God --you've got a nail sticking out of your chest, Dad.
She's gonna figure it out.
Listen, I love you.
I'm never gonna live this down.
I love you!
(siren wailing) (dramatic music) How are you gonna shock me with a little nail sticking out of my chest?
These leads are for monitoring, not shocking.
Just making sure everything still sounds okay.
Oh, damn it!
What's wrong?
I didn't say I love you back to my daughter.
What if that's the last time I speak to her?
CHIMNEY: Don't worry.
You'll have plenty more chances to tell her later.
Chim, did you place these leads correctly?
Of course I did. Why?
He's about to code.
We're still four minutes out.
I got the bag.
Yeah.
All right, starting compressions.
* Oh!
I think I'm making the hole in his heart bigger.
They'll fix it at the hospital, but only if he's not dead.
* CHIMNEY: Still no heartbeat.
Come on.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, you're not leaving your daughter hanging like that.
We got a pulse.
(squishes) Yep.
Heart's beating again.
* You hungry?
Wanna grab a bite after we drop him?
Definitely.
I haven't had a proper meal since Bobby left.
(upbeat music) Whoa.
What happened here?
He started coding. We had to start CPR.
Things got a little messy.
Yep, but now his ticker's pumping like Old Faithful.
80 BPM with normal rhythm.
* And I just lost my appetite.
And I just found mine.
(line rings) Hey, where are you going?
To ask your sister out on a proper date so I can tell her I love her.
We missed a lot, huh?
* You picked some great spots, Harry.
I think you're a natural at this.
My grandpa was a landscaper.
Yeah?
Yeah.
How many trees did you plant with your grandpa?
None. He died before I was born.
But he taught Dad and Dad taught me.
Ah.
Where in the hell have you two been?
Dad, me and Bobby went hiking.
We went to go find some spots for the tree.
We were supposed to go together.
Hey, we just wanted you to rest.
Bobby, I am fine.
No, Michael, you're not.
And I think it's time we all start admitting that.
Oh, do you now?
Do you have any other thoughts of how I should be handling my brain tumor?
I've got a few, yeah.
Dad, I -- Harry, stop.
Bobby and I are talking.
No, you're not. You're fighting.
That's not tradition.
Harry.
I don't even wanna be here. Let's just go home.
Harry!
* Hey, I know I'm just here as the in-case-of-emergency guy, but he is terrified.
The numbness in your hands, the fatigue -- you think you're hiding it, but he sees it and it's making that tumor suddenly very real to him.
Oh, well, it's pretty real to me too.
I'm the one fighting for my life here.
Well, what about his life?
And May's?
Did you know that she got into USC?
What? When?
She got the news two days ago.
Then she found out we were going on this camping trip and I got to see the joy just evaporate from her face because she's that worried about you.
And she blames herself for you not having that surgery.
That has nothing to do with her.
Michael, her father might be dying.
How does that not have everything to do with her, with Harry, with Athena?
We're all just trying to support you, Michael, but you keep pushing us away.
I'm not pushing anybody away.
Listen, man, I'm taking steps back so you guys can have all the space.
You know, to learn.
Learn what?
How to be a family when I'm gone.
* (upbeat music) * Big plans tonight?
Maybe?
Chimney said that he's gonna take me out for dinner.
There's something that he has to tell me face to face that can't wait.
Oh, God. You don't think he's -- Breaking up with me?
Well, if he is, he picked a very expensive restaurant to do it in.
Oh, then it must be good news.
I guess. I don't know.
He just sounded serious, and Chimney never sounds serious.
What if -- Uh-uh. No what ifs.
Don't be the person who immediately assumes the worst anytime they get asked out on a hot date.
That's my job now, remember?
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking. How are you holding up?
Honestly, a little skittish still.
Yesterday, I was convinced I saw Greg, or whatever his actual name is, outside this building.
Of course, the day before that, I thought I saw him at my chiropractor's.
The "jumping at shadows" phase.
It'll pass. I promise.
And I'm counting on it.
What are you still doing here? It's the end of shift.
Why is no one going home?
Picking up some extra hours.
Well, I'm going home to change for -- I don't know what.
Anyway, wish me luck.
Luck.
And I want all the juicy details in the morning.
Kay.
So no karaoke tonight?
Guess not.
Okay.
I knew he was stubborn. (laughs) I just hoped he'd snap out of it and do what makes the most sense.
(laughs) You mean do what you think makes the most sense.
Well, yeah.
I can't help it that I'm usually right.
(laughs) How's the camping trip going?
Oh, it's fine.
At least that's what Harry says.
(laughs) What, you don't believe him?
Yeah, I do.
It's just that...
I'm worried about him.
I never thought in a million years that I'd have to prepare him for the possibility of losing his dad.
Not at 10 years old.
Mm, some things you really can't prepare them for.
Because you're not prepared yourself.
Hmm.
That's what worries me.
Both my parents are in their 70s.
And I've thought about what life would be like if I lost one of them.
But not losing Michael.
How am I supposed to come to terms with that?
You're not.
You're just supposed to take it one day at a time.
You wake up, you breathe, and you hope for the best.
Easier said than done when I don't know how many days he has left.
You know, I bet this isn't the first time that Harry and May have had to face the possible reality of losing a parent.
What do you mean?
Athena, you're a cop.
You risk your life every day.
You don't think that Michael's had to prepare them for the day that you don't make it home?
Because I'm sure he has.
Oh, but that isn't this.
I mean, this thing with Michael is looming over us constantly.
Me not coming home from work, that's a distant possibility.
Maybe.
You know what May said the other day?
"Assuming there is a next year." I mean, she casually mentioned that her father could be gone in a year?
Maybe she's right.
Embrace the not knowing.
Let it force you to live every day like it could be his last.
Your other option is to live in fear of it, Athena, and that's -- that's not who you are.
But I am afraid.
If he dies, I'm scared of what it'll do to May and Harry, what it'll do to me.
I won't be able to ease the pain for them.
They love Bobby. They do.
But they need their father.
Kids are resilient. Hmm?
They're tougher than we give 'em credit for.
It may not seem like it right now, but whatever happens, they'll be okay.
I hope you're right.
(dinner music) * Thank you very much.
I have never been to a revolving restaurant before.
Sorry that we're not actually revolving.
I was lucky to get a reservation at all.
No, the view is still great.
I can people-watch without straining my neck.
It does kind of feel like the world is passing us by, doesn't it?
An apt metaphor, I suppose.
What does that mean?
(sighs) I love you.
* I didn't mean to lead with that.
And I don't mean to push or make you feel uncomfortable, but...
I think I've been uncomfortable, like -- like I'm supposed to hold back, not scare you off, not tell you how I feel.
So that's how I feel. (laughs) You don't have to say it back.
I'm not sure that I can.
Not in those actual words.
(sighs) Look, I used to say it a lot.
Even after I stopped feeling that way.
They were a shield.
An automatic response to an immediate threat.
I understand. And if you can't -- But it is how I feel about you.
I feel a lot of things when I'm with you.
Happy.
Safe.
A million other things that I can't explain right now, but I do feel all of that.
For you.
And I'm sorry. I really wish that I could -- No, you don't have to. I get it.
I love you, Maddie.
And as long as I know you feel the same, I can say it enough for the both of us.
(both laugh) Joy.
That's another feeling.
* So now that we know we're on the same page, there's a few other things I wanted to discuss.
You stay over pretty late.
Sometimes you even stay the night.
LARRY: I just wanna say -- And I was thinking that maybe we need to take the next step -- Oh, my God.
Public proposals make me squirm.
What?
No. Maddie, no.
Wait, what? No.
No. Not you, them.
Oh.
Wendy, baby, I just wanna say...
um...
(gasps) Oh, my God.
LARRY: Uh-oh.
Well?
Well?
Are you gonna open the box? (laughs) LARRY: You -- WENDY: Oh.
Oh. (both laugh) Sorry. Flustered.
I mean, as if there isn't enough pressure on a marriage proposal, they add an audience.
Doesn't look like she's gonna say no.
Maybe she wants to say no.
Oh, Larry, you dope. (laughs) (laughs) Cheers.
Cheers.
(laughs) * Find it?
Not yet.
Oh. Found it.
Um...
The answer is -- You're joking.
WENDY: Seriously, Larry?
Oh, boy.
WENDY: Earrings?
Five years together and you bring me up here for earrings?
It's your birthday.
Yeah, next week.
I wanted to surprise you.
Well, I'm not surprised. I'm --oh!
Crushed! (cracking sound) Wendy!
(screams) (screams) LARRY: Oh, God! Wendy!
(Wendy screaming) LARRY: Oh, my God!
I'll call 9-1-1.
(screams) LARRY: Oh, no!
CHIMNEY: It's bolted to the floor.
They all are, for safety.
I'm the manager. How can I help?
Is there any way you can get this to go other direction?
No, it only travels clockwise.
Got significant damage to the pelvic bone.
It could be separated.
Pulse is steady.
Are you guys doctors?
Former nurse.
Current paramedic.
All right, I gotta find something to pry this loose.
Watch her vitals, there could be internal hemorrhaging.
Wendy, my name is Maddie and I'm gonna stay with you, okay?
(dramatic music) How are we doing, Wendy?
Oh, I should've broke up three years ago.
CHIMNEY: Make a hole, make a hole.
All right, I'm gonna get the table out of the way.
Can you hold her up?
Yep. Okay.
I want you to do me a favor, okay?
Look out that window.
We're gonna concentrate together on that beautiful view.
Can you do that?
(screams) You're doing great.
(screams) Keep looking out the window.
(grunting) (screaming) Help me with this table.
Ready?
(both grunt) WENDY: Ah, it hurts, it hurts.
Okay.
Let's get her on the ground. On three, ready?
One, two, three.
(Wendy screams, sobs) MADDIE: Okay.
WOMAN: Hope she's all right.
Okay.
(screams) You were right. The pelvis is separated.
We've got arterial bleeding in the interior organs.
MADDIE: Okay, we gotta get this splinted.
Tablecloth?
Switch places with me.
MADDIE: All right.
CHIMNEY: We're gonna roll you, okay?
Okay, here we go.
MADDIE: Ready? Go.
CHIMNEY: Easy.
(screams) Okay.
All right.
Okay. Gentle, gentle.
We're good.
Okay.
I feel so stupid.
Don't. I'm the idiot.
I didn't ask because I never thought you would say yes, but you did.
But you didn't ask.
I'm asking now.
Yes, Larry.
Yes.
CROWD: Aww.
(scattered applause) * MADDIE: (sighs) Public proposals.
You know that wasn't a proposal, by the way.
I mean me, not them.
It wasn't?
No.
Wait, were you gonna ask me to move in with you?
Honestly, I was gonna offer you a drawer.
(both laugh) A drawer?
You know, I've never seen this side of you before.
Kicking ass and saving lives.
It's kinda hot.
You too.
Good with your hands.
Very precise.
Oh, I'm all about precision.
Thank you so much, both of you.
Sure.
Not a problem.
If there's anything I or the hotel can do to repay you, just name it.
(upbeat music) (door handle clicks) * Whoa.
(laughs) Ooh, a big suite even.
Well, they said they comped the room.
Hopefully same thing goes for the minibar.
God, I do love you.
You better.
(solemn music) * (sighs) Is Harry still on the phone with Athena?
He fell asleep halfway through the conversation.
I told her we'd call her back in the morning.
(sighs) I'm sorry about before.
Dropping that on you the way that I did.
Well, I'm sorry too.
I wanna help, Michael. Just tell me how.
(sighs) Harry never knew my father.
* He died before we could tell anyone that Athena was pregnant.
It was a...ha...
massive stroke.
He collapsed working on someone's yard.
Must've been a hard time.
Oh yeah.
But when we found out we were having a boy?
Man.
I wanted to be excited.
But I --I could only think about my father and how my son would never know him.
How he would never meet the man who made me who I am.
Now, you know Athena. She had all the answers.
(laughs) Of course.
She said that we would name our son Harry.
Mm.
After his grandfather.
And that we would talk about him and our son would know him even without having met him.
* And he does.
The way he talks about your father and the trips to this place, you've kept him alive for Harry.
And that's why I brought you here.
I have had 18 years with my daughter.
I have watched her grow into an amazing, strong young woman.
Mm-hmm.
But my son -- He's still a boy.
Oh, man.
I wanna be there with him.
I wanna see him grow up.
And I don't know if I will be.
* It's just --if something happens to me, I need someone.
I need you to help keep me and my father alive for him.
* I will do that.
* SINGER: * At last (Etta James' "At Last") * You ordered room service.
With candles.
Well, we never got to have our candlelight dinner.
SINGER: * My lonely days are over * Candlelight breakfast will do just fine.
Yeah.
* SINGER: * And life is like a song * So how did it go?
Well, we communed with nature, planted a tree, and ate s'mores under the stars.
Sounds like you had fun.
BOBBY: We did.
Just about to head out, so we'll probably be home by the time you're off shift.
How's Michael doing?
SINGER: * The skies above are blue * He's good.
We'll see you soon.
SINGER: * My heart was wrapped up in clover *
* * The night I looked at you Where were you all night?
None of your business.
You should've called. I was worried.
Well, you know, I took Maddie out to talk and things...
What?
Ignited.
SINGER: * At last * So? How'd it go last night?
I need details.
Well, there was a pelvic splint involved.
Kinky.
(laughs) It seems like there's a big police presence here today.
What's up?
Uh, scheduled sit-alongs.
It's on the calendar, not that you ever read it.
Well, I don't have to. I have you.
Wha --Jamal, have you been here all night?
No, just feels like I was.
(phone vibrating) CHIMNEY: Hey.
Hi.
MADDIE: I'm just clocking in.
Were there any problems getting out of the hotel this morning?
100% comped as promised.
MADDIE: Perfect.
Just like everything else last night.
Yeah, we should get done up and paint the town more often.
Oh, I don't know.
My favorite part didn't involve fancy clothes.
Or any clothes at all?
Morning, Maddie.
Morning.
Okay, so this conversation is officially not safe for work.
I really should go.
CHIMNEY: Okay.
Call me after your shift.
MADDIE: Sure.
CHIMNEY: Oh, and I was thinking maybe we could, like, go to Wi Spa after work.
I'm going to have you do a sit-along with Maddie.
Maddie, this is Officer Brown. He's going to be shadowing you to see how we work at the call center.
Hi, handsome.
(dramatic music) See any good movies lately?
CHIMNEY: Maddie?
Stay calm.
End the call.
CHIMNEY: What's going on?
I can hear stuff.
Carefully.
CHIMNEY: Hey, listen.
Do you want me to, like, call back or something?
Maybe I should -- I love you, Howie.
* (generator powers off) Ladies and gentlemen -- (crowd gasping, murmuring) Get up. Get up.
GREG: We are taking control of this facility.
Do not move, or you will be shot.
 @@@@@@
(upbeat music) * (horn honks) * Morning!
Didn't get any sleep last night.
I was so nervous about being late.
You are late.
Yeah, by three minutes.
A job like this, you're on time or you're dead.
Sorry.
I've never worked in a team before.
Do you have any advice, you know, for a rookie?
Talk less.
SINGER: * I'm from L dot A dot * Californ-I-A hot * Days got shade * Let me take you round the way *
* Lot of out-of-towners can't handle this city *
* Where you wear the wrong color *

You guys weren't!
SINGER: * But you gotta see once, L. A. * (dramatic music) * Set it to channel nine.
Administrator level key cards.
Give us access to every door in the call center.
Once we take dispatch, clock starts.
60 minutes in and out. Be ready for my call.
Think you can stick to that schedule?
Three minutes, guys. Come on, get over it.
Let's go.
* (distant sirens) * GREG: Morning.
Here for our sit-along.
(lock beeps) Have fun up there.
Thanks.
We will.
First stop, second floor. Server room.
(elevator dings) * (lock beeps) * Terry Flores?
Can I help you guys?
* (elevator dings) Morning, officers.
How'd you know we were here?
Well, this is my secret weapon.
I can see everything with this.
I thought there were five of you.
They had to make a pit stop.
You gotta show me how this thing works.
(laughing) Okay.
* Morning, Jake.
Morning.
* Good. Come on.
Take down the system.
Messaging, CAD, all of it.
Hard reboot.
That's gonna raise a lot of red flags.
Dispatch'll go blind for -- Seven minutes.
Say it's temporary maintenance.
Happens all the time.
* (computer beeping) * So how'd it go last night? I need details.
Well, there was a pelvic splint involved.
Kinky.
Seems like there's a big police presence today.
What's up?
Scheduled sit-alongs.
It's on the calendar, not that you ever read it.
Well, I don't have to. I have you.
(phone rings) Security.
TERRY: Hey, it's Terry Flores.
I'm locked out of the server room.
Second floor.
Can you come up here?
Now?
* (phone buzzing) * Hi. I'm just clocking in.
Were there any problems getting out of the hotel this morning?
100% comped as promised.
MADDIE: Perfect.
Just like everything else last night.
* Terry?
* You up here?
(tense music building) JAKE: What the -- (both grunting) * Morning, Maddie.
Morning.
Okay, so this conversation is officially not safe for work.
I really should go.
CHIMNEY: Okay.
I'm gonna have you do a sit-along with Maddie.
Maddie, this is Officer Brown.
Hi, handsome.
See any good movies lately?
* Stay calm.
End the call.
CHIMNEY: Maddie?
Carefully.
CHIMNEY: Hello, Maddie? Are you there?
Did I lose you?
I love you, Howie.
* (phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) Ladies and gentlemen.
(crowd gasping) WOMAN: Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Get up. Get up!
GREG: We are taking control of this facility.
Do not move or you will be shot.
You are now our hostages.
Get up, everybody! Get up, up, up, up, up, up.
Up, move. We need you up.
* ELLIS: All right, grab his uniform.
I got the tech.
(gunshot) Up the stairs.
GREG: Let's go. Hurry.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
(panicked chatter) GREG: Quickly, move, move, move.
Hurry, quickly, quickly.
Cell phones, key cards, wallets, smart watches, whatever's in your pocket goes in the can.
My EpiPen.
I'm allergic to bees.
Bees are the least of your troubles today, sweetheart.
* (Terry grunts) * I don't know what you want, but someone's going to notice when 9-1-1 stops answering.
ELLIS: You had a system crash.
Valley Division is picking up the slack right now, but your servers are rebooting.
Should be back in two minutes.
* We've got Dispatch.
(radio static) I've got the lobby.
Don't you worry, folks.
We're gonna get you back to work.
But under our supervision.
We will be monitoring all calls that come in and approving all resources that you send out.
Call volume's low this early in the morning, so we don't need all of you.
You. Step forward.
Two of you, step forward.
Everybody else, you're on deck where you will wait in silence until we rotate you through.
Let's go!
FOSTER: Move!
GREG: Now, people, move! It's not so hard.
Let's go!
(barking orders) (panicked chatter) FOSTER: Move! Come on!
MAN: Keep your mouth shut.
MAN: Come here, shut up.
On the ground. On the ground!
GREG: One hour.
Then we're out of here.
So I don't care if you need a bathroom break or a bottle of water.
You will stay where we can see you.
If anyone tries anything at all -- You'll shoot us.
No.
* We'll shoot the person next to you.
You guys like saving lives, right?
Why don't you start with your own?
* (phones ringing) How did you know?
You dropped the mug before they pulled the guns out.
I recognized him.
Greg, or whatever his name is.
My date from hell.
He's the one that attacked you?
They targeted you because you work here.
This is all my fault.
If I'd told the police -- No, this is not your fault.
No matter what the plan -- Maddie.
You only do something like this so you can do something worse.
We have to warn someone.
I already did.
I just hope he gets the message.
(tense music) Okay, she said that she loves you.
That's weird, right?
Is that weird?
(sighs) Come on, Maddie. Answer.
(laughs) You know, all right.
* MADDIE: You've reached Maddie's phone.
Leave a message.
(dramatic music) You're being paranoid. She's fine.
(sighs) Come on. Don't be that guy.
Don't do it, Chimney. Don't do it.
Come on, man!
Oh, my God.
(groans) (line ringing) MESSAGE: Sorry.
We're experiencing a high call volume at the moment.
Please -- It's 8:00 in the morning.
All right, you know what?
(phone rings) Yep. Go for Buck.
How come 9-1-1 doesn't respond when I call?
Uh, is that some kind of riddle?
Like "who watches the Watchmen?" Neither of those things are riddles.
Okay, I just tried calling 9-1-1 and I got the high call volume message.
I miss, like, an earthquake or something?
Nope, pretty chill morning.
Wait, why are you calling 9-1-1?
Is everything okay?
(sighs) Your sister said that she loved me.
Yeah.
Wasn't that the whole point in that big date you had last night?
You declare your love and she declares hers?
Yeah, I know, okay, but she didn't, all right?
At least not last night.
Look, she made this big deal saying that she couldn't say those words, and then this morning, she blurts them out and hangs up on me.
It's still not quite sounding like an emergency.
Because I sound insane.
She's at the call center. What could happen there, right?
You know what? Forget it.
(sighs) * DISPATCHER: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
DISPATCHERS: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
Where are you calling from?
CALLER: Downtown.
The corner of 9th and Los Angeles Street.
Multiple vehicle collision, 9th and Los Angeles Street.
Can you move the vehicles out of the intersection?
CALLER: I guess, but are you gonna send someone?
Absolutely. Help is on the way.
Can I roll police and medical RA?
No. No one goes into that area.
Call it a no-fly zone.
Time to rotate.
FOSTER: Get up.
Sit down. Sit down.
You, come with me. Let's go.
FOSTER: Come on.
Wait. Just wait.
(dramatic music) (whispering) Downtown.
They don't want anyone downtown.
* MAY: And Dad? He's okay?
Yeah, Bobby says he's doing good.
They're on their way back from the campsite now.
Baby, I gotta go.
Love you.
(siren wails) (indistinct arguing) (upbeat music) MAN: It was yellow!
It was reckless, jackass!
Okay, folks. Settle down.
Why don't you each go to your own car and let me sort this out.
We were in the same car.
That's my husband.
Okay.
Anybody call 9-1-1?
Isn't that why you're here?
727L30, they're requesting you at 19124 Sunset.
Assault and battery in progress.
Copy.
Dispatch, at 9th and Los Angeles.
Non-injury car accident.
ELLIS: Yes.
Units are already en route to that location.
Please proceed to assault and battery in progress.
Copy that.
Okay, officers are on their way.
Try not to kill each other before they get here.
727L30 en route.
* And there she goes.
(siren wails) ELLIS: Tiffany, you're clear for deliver.
* (box whirring) * (high-pitched whine) Package has been delivered.
* (alarm blaring) (tablet beeping) Huh. Automated alert.
Security alarm. We usually send officers.
Security alarm. First and Grand.
Should we send someone?
No, it's handled.
Time to rotate. You two, up.
* Rover team.
Go fetch.
(dramatic music) (siren wailing) * You mean to tell me it took four of you to subdue a two person brawl and then you called for me?
WILLIAMS: We didn't call you.
Still trying to figure out who called us.
Jackson already had the fight handled when we rolled up.
Maybe Dispatch had a late night last night?
I guess so.
Dispatch, is there a reason you sent four officers to break up a fight?
Five now, including me.
ELLIS: Sorry, Sergeant, we're having some technical difficulties this morning.
Apologies for the mix-up.
Hey, is that incident downtown taken care of?
Affirmative. Everything's clear there.
HUGHES: I don't know why the alarm company requested a hard confirm.
Our cameras went down for about a minute.
Some kind of power surge.
But we told 'em everything was fine.
Probably just covering their you-know-what.
Can't get through to the admin at Dispatch.
Hey, we need verification before we let you do a walkthrough.
* All lines are busy right now.
Put down the phone.
* Took down the cameras. Alarms are on bypass.
Guess we're all set then.
(whistles) Tiffany!
Time to go shopping.
See you soon.
CALLER: They put green onions in my omelet.
That's not an emergency, ma'am.
CALLER: I explicitly told them I was allergic.
That's attempted murder.
Are you having an allergic reaction?
CALLER: I'm not actually allergic, but they didn't know that!
(laughs) You can't tie up our lines because someone made the wrong breakfast order.
CALLER: Of course I can.
My tax dollars pay your salary.
You still feel like you're making a difference?
I bet this woman really thinks you're...
God, what is the word?
I'll never be rich, but I'll be...
BOTH: Worthwhile.
(grunting) Ma'am, it is a crime to make a false report to 9-1-1.
I could have you arrested.
CALLER: What?
You're gonna send the police?
Yes. I am.
I'm sending someone now.
You might not wanna be there when they arrive.
You feel better, big guy?
I do.
Good.
Let's rotate you out.
* GREG: You two. With me.
Let's go.
Move!
(both grunt) * JAMAL: Why do they keep moving us around like this?
To disorient us.
So we can't make a plan.
(whimpering softly) Hey.
Are you okay?
I don't wanna die in here.
No one is gonna die.
Jake's dead.
They shot him.
* We have to get a message out.
JOSH: I did.
A woman called about onions in an omelet.
I dispatched an officer.
To the restaurant?
Not exactly.
Buck, do not try and talk me out of this.
I need to go down there for myself and make sure that she's okay.
Yeah, no, she -- she didn't pick up when I called her either.
I tried calling Josh and it went straight to voicemail.
Now I'm definitely going.
(knocking) BUCK: What if something is wrong?
Maybe we should call the police.
* I think someone already did.
I know, Captain.
CAD's been glitching all morning.
What is she saying now?
She's making her case.
Yeah, I'll wait to hear from you.
Now she's folding like a cheap suit.
All right, let me talk to Athena.
Captain needs to make some calls.
As evidence goes, an "I love you" is less than convincing.
But they sent you down to my apartment for an assault with a deadly onion.
That feels more convincing.
Well, she's gonna talk to Operations, see if they can get eyes in the building, see if anything's wrong.
BUCK: No, no, no. We can't just send in SWAT.
If there is someone inside the call center doing something, they'll know we're onto them.
(dramatic music) Let's go for a drive.
Talk to you later, Buck.
No, no, Chimney!
Chimney, don't hang up!
* Elvis Presley's "A Little Less Conversation") * SINGER: * A little less conversation *
* A little more action please *
* All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me *
* A little more bite and a little less bark *
* A little less fight and a little more spark *
* Close your mouth and open up your heart *
* And baby, satisfy me * Satisfy me, baby * A little more bite and a little less bark *
* A little less fight and a little more spark *
* Close your mouth and open up your heart *
* And baby, satisfy me * Satisfy me, baby * Come on, baby, I'm tired of talking * Girl Blue?
Yeah, and Cider Falls.
Rover team. Status update.
We've got four so far.
That's less than a third of the list.
We're moving as fast as we can.
It's taking longer than we thought to get it out of the frame.
So leave them in the damn frames.
There's GPS trackers in the frames.
Pick up the damn pace.
SINGER: * A little less conversation *
* A little more action please *
* All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me * (dramatic music) * You're quiet.
Should I be worried?
No.
I mean, I'm still freaked out but at least now I got a partner in this.
We are not partners.
You're here so I can keep an eye on you, make sure you don't do anything foolish.
(engine revving) ATHENA: Is that who I think it is?
(siren wailing) (sighs) Okay, now don't be mad.
(grunts) CHIMNEY: Hey, Buck.
Hey, Chim.
You two tell anyone else what's happening at the call center?
Good, because I'm running out of room in here.
* Hey. We've got a problem.
Yeah, we're way behind schedule.
A new problem. Look.
Police cruiser.
What? Pulling in here?
* CHIMNEY: Okay, we're here. Now what?
Well, if everything's normal, I'll be able to walk in that front door and go inside.
Take a look around and see if everyone forgot to charge their damn cell phone.
And if it's not normal?
I guess we'll find out.
* OLIVER: Hey, guys. Cop approaching.
What do you want me to do?
GREG: How many?
OLIVER: Looks like she's alone.
What the hell is she doing here?
Officers routinely come here for pursuit recordings, call recordings -- GREG: Shut up!
OLIVER: She's coming in.
What do you want me to do?
* Morning.
Morning.
I'm here to follow up on a call.
Mind if I go up?
Yeah, sure.
GREG: She's coming up? That's not good.
Shoot her.
What?
Are you serious?
Did you say something?
Nah, just --world's gone crazy.
(laughs) Don't I know it?
You wanna kill a cop? I didn't sign up for that.
Yeah, none of us did. That's not your call to make.
I don't work for you.
Shoot her now.
GREG: No.
* (indistinct arguing on radio) No, wait! Wait.
I can get rid of her.
Whatever you're gonna do, do it.
Go.
(elevator dings) (safety clicks) SUE: 727L30, we've got a report of a code 77 at Eagle Rock Lanes.
* Guess I'll have to follow up later.
I hope your day's quiet.
Yeah, you too.
* OLIVER: She's headed back to her car.
We're clear.
* Good job.
I just don't wanna see anybody shot.
No one is getting shot unless I authorize it.
Told you not to bring him.
What's a code 77 anyway?
SUE: Urinating in public.
Or indecent exposure.
It's been a while since I worked the radio.
ATHENA: I'm sure, Captain.
They knew I was downstairs.
Yeah, they're using the CAD to monitor our locations.
That was Sue Blevins on the radio giving me the code 77.
Who's ever running this, they're doing it from inside the dispatch center.
What's a code 77?
Ambush.
Proceed with caution.
* There has to be a way to communicate with our people inside.
Well, if they're tracking our vehicles, you gotta assume they're monitoring our calls too.
(grunts) Screen went blank.
ATHENA: Okay, good.
We're off the grid.
Hey, hey, hey.
I know you're worried, okay? I am too.
But Maddie is smart.
She can take care of herself until help gets there.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Nobody inside that building knows we're coming for them.
What if they get tired of waiting?
(engine turns over) (tense music) * LINDA: What happens to us when it's time for them to leave?
I mean, if they killed Jake -- They're not gonna wanna leave behind a room full of witnesses.
The hour's almost up.
We're running out of time.
Why the touching?
Take a look!
I don't think we're the only ones.
Take a look. What do you see?
Still don't see anything.
Yeah, that's my point.
The police car that pulled up before, it's gone.
I can't find it.
You're being paranoid. There's nothing to see.
Come here!
Okay.
Come here.
Just rewind it.
Find out where she was when she went offline.
This is in real time.
You can't just rewind it from here.
That's not the way the system works, you idiot.
She may have disabled her GPS.
I'm an idiot?
If the cop were dead right now, we wouldn't be worried about her GPS.
Killing people.
That's your solution to every problem?
I can think of one problem it would solve.
ELLIS: Seriously? You're gonna pull a gun on me?
(grunts) (all screaming) GREG: Hey, hey!
Hey! Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
* No!
No!
JOSH: No, no, no, no, no.
(gunfire) Hey!
(grunts) (screams) Next one goes in your head.
(grunts) Back to your stations now!
Get back on your stations.
(grunting) Take this hero downstairs.
See if he can find your cop car.
ELLIS: Come on.
Get up. Get up.
Get up!
Get this jackass out of here.
(groaning) Josh.
(coughing and groaning) * Tiffany, how are we doing?
(radio static) Tiffany.
TIFFANY: I need another 30 minutes.
Damn it!
(both whimper) * So much for the fire alarm.
I guess we're out of options now.
I don't know. You know what?
I could --I could fake a heart attack.
Then use the defibrillator on the bad guys.
All of 'em?
Huh?
(siren wailing) MAYNARD: Construction crews are closing down streets between here and Dispatch, getting ready for SWAT to move in.
How are we doing with GPS?
ATHENA: Well, we've kept off the radios.
Calling units individually.
Everyone's been told how to disable their system before coming here.
Kay, so what's the plan?
You know, what happens next?
We're still trying to get eyes into a damn windowless room.
That's it?
We were able to get eyes on the digital logs.
They share a system with Valley division.
According to the logs, five LAPD officers were scheduled for sit-alongs.
None of the names on the list checked out.
They're not LAPD.
So five bad guys inside and no plan to get our guys out?
No, we got a plan. We just don't like it.
MORRISEY: Captain Maynard.
Dave Morrisey, Valley Communications.
Mr. Morrisey, thanks for coming.
Sergeant Grant.
SWAT commander would like to talk to you.
He has some questions.
I'm not sure how I can help.
You used to work in there.
You're the closest thing we've got to eyes inside.
* So this is really happening.
Sorry I thought you were crazy.
I'm sorry I wasn't.
* Keep going. Go.
MADDIE: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
Get up. Move it, come on.
Josh, are you doing okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Ears are just ringing a little.
'Kay.
Ellis should be back by now.
What do you want me to do about it?
What you're good at.
Nothing.
(screams) * So you figured all this out 'cause Sue gave you a code 77?
No.
That was the last piece of the puzzle.
Calls have been weird all day.
Hey, you can access their call log with that, right?
Oh, sure. What do you wanna look at?
The first piece of the puzzle.
How we doing with those RA units?
The 122 and the 133 just got here.
There's two more houses en route.
Captain, who are all these people on the bus?
Off-duty dispatchers.
Once we take back the building, somebody has to handle call response.
Take it back?
You're not gonna negotiate, see if they surrender first?
They haven't asked for anything or made any demands.
They don't even want us to know they control the building.
If we reach out to them, we're gonna lose the one thing we've got going for us: the element of surprise.
We do this right, we hit 'em fast, take the building before they even know we're outside.
And if you don't?
Why do you think we asked for so many RA units?
* ELLIS: So now there are no police cars visible.
I'm telling you, I don't know.
Figure it out!
What's going on here?
That police car's not the only one that's gone dark.
You think they know we're here?
Could be a system glitch.
Time to cut our losses.
(dramatic music) Stay here.
GREG: Tiffany. Tiffany, come in.
Tiffany, what's taking so long?
Excuse me, can I check on Josh?
I used to be a nurse.
Good for you.
He might have a concussion or something.
You can check on him when we're done.
Which is gonna be when exactly?
You said an hour and it's been longer than that.
Sit down and shut up.
I'll worry about the time.
So you are worried.
That makes sense, 'cause all your friends keep disappearing.
Are they even in the same building?
Let's go.
We can still make it out of here.
We can go down the back stairs.
I have a car waiting around the corner.
We split the art up between the five of us and we go our separate ways.
I like that part of the plan.
Wait, you've got a car parked down the street?
You were always gonna double-cross Greg.
You weren't?
Didn't I tell you to shut up?
(yelps) (gasping) Oh, my God, Linda?
Linda?
(gasping) What the hell is wrong with her?
I don't know!
If we're gonna do this, you can't just sell famous works of art on eBay.
You can't sell them from prison either.
(gasps) Epi...Pen...
* She's in anaphylaxis.
She's having an allergic reaction.
Allergic to what?
I -- Latex.
Is there latex in your gloves?
How would I know?
Okay, she's gonna die if she doesn't get her medication.
Then go! Go get it!
You hurry up!
* Damn it.
GREG: Hurry up!
Okay.
* Oh, my God.
(screams) God -- * (wheezes) (groaning and wheezing) MAN: Hey! What's going on?
DISPATCHER: Now! Get him!
DISPATCHER: Grab his gun.
DISPATCHER: Drop him.
Get him now!
Here.
* Rover crew, change of plan.
Leave the Van Gogh.
Are you sure?
You heard the man.
Leave the Van Gogh.
Wait, there's a Van Gogh?
Tiffany, start the van. We're coming out hot.
Tiffany. We're coming out now.
Get the van ready!
LAPD! Freeze!
(sirens wailing) On your knees!
* ATHENA: Put your hands up!
You're under arrest.
Guys, what the hell was that?
FOSTER: Heist is blown.
Where are you going?
Somewhere where there's hostages!
* I'm out of here.
Green light. Green light.
(gunshot) * Next one goes in your head.
* OFFICER: On the ground! Get on the ground!
OFFICER: Get down! Get down!
* Get down. Let's move.
(breathing heavily) Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
* Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm not getting a pulse.
What?
I don't know.
I must have hit a vein and stopped his heartbeat or something.
No.
No!
No, Josh!
You don't get to die.
MADDIE: Wait.
* You don't get to die.
* (grunting) (sobs) * (can clunking) SUE: They're coming in!
Get down! Get down!
OFFICER: Go, go!
(indistinct shouting) (sobbing) OFFICER: Put your hands up!
OFFICER: Get on your knees! Hands above your head!
OFFICER: Get your hands up now!
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back. I'm not going back.
Let me see your hands!
Get your hands up!
Hands up now!
(gunfire) * OFFICER: Step away, sir.
Hands up! Hands up!
* Command, this is squad leader. We've got Dispatch.
* One, two, three.
I got a pulse.
* (people chatting anxiously) * 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
DISPATCHER: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
DISPATCHERS: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
(sirens wailing) * OFFICER: Ma'am, please come this way.
Ma'am.
* CHIMNEY: Maddie! Maddie, Maddie!
* (sobbing) * I got you. I got you, Maddie.
I got you.
* I'm surprised you're not over there with your sister.
She already has everything she needs.
* (laughter) How did you know that the museum was their target?
The car accident.
ELLIS: 727L30, proceed to assault and battery in progress.
I knew there had to be a reason why they hadn't wanted me there.
MAN: That's why they took over the call center.
ATHENA: To dispatch police away from a crime.
HARRY: That's smart.
ATHENA: But your mother's smarter.
I checked the dispatch log.
That's when I saw an alarm had gone off at the museum.
Two blocks away from the accident scene.
They sent you away because they wanted to remove $1/2 billion of art off the wall.
And they almost got away with it.
At this time, I would like to exercise my Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and would like to invoke my Sixth Amendment right to counsel provided by the state.
(upbeat music) Just get me a damn lawyer.
Yeah, not talking without a lawyer.
Lawyer.
Lawyer.
Lawyer.
GREG: I don't need a lawyer.
I'm interested in cutting a deal.
Good.
Start by telling us about the security guard.
That wasn't me. That was Tiffany's idea.
* Wait.
You didn't round her up too?
Who's Tiffany?
(The Zombies' "She's Not There") * SINGER: * Well, no one told me about her * Turns out she was the real mastermind and Greg was just the hired hand, but he didn't know who had hired him.
When do we meet?
TIFFANY (distorted): Not until after the drop.
Now, about your team...
MADDIE: They were all men that Greg knew.
They had worked together before.
They had even done time together after their last job went wrong.
If everyone knew each other, how did she get herself on the team?
That last job, the one they went to prison for, the driver had been killed, which meant they needed a new one.
And she came highly recommended by herself.
So Greg walked them all through the plan.
It was precise, flawless -- everyone was impressed.
The only thing left was to find someone to get them inside the call center.
And that's why they targeted you.
Not exactly.
Tiffany already had an inside man.
Jake, the security guard.
He knew our protocols, could get them on the visitors list, he had access to the entire building.
(phone dings) He was perfect.
BUCK: So what went wrong?
Jake was a little too perfect.
(upbeat music) JAKE: Tiffany?
You must be Jake.
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
I'm just glad that you're here.
I think that people get a little too hung up watching the clock anyway.
Don't you?
(laughs) * (laughter) Tiffany fell in love with Jake.
Well, her plan was to use Jake and let him take the fall but now she needed a new fall guy.
Me.
So you don't think online dating is a terrible idea?
I think everyone has a match.
You just have to find him.
* They bought it, babe. We're in business.
MADDIE: They couldn't steal Josh's badge because it would be cancelled the second that it was reported stolen.
So they borrowed it, duplicated it, and then returned it.
BRANFORD: Officers recovered your keys and your wallet.
At least they saved me the hassle of replacing all my credit cards and IDs.
It was go-time.
Have fun up there.
Can I help you guys?
(phone rings) Security.
Can you come up here?
MADDIE: But now instead of one plan, there were two.
* (gunshot) Sorry. I'm just trying to sell it.
Give me the uniform.
Ladies and gentlemen -- MADDIE: Greg and his guys took over dispatch, waited on the alarm call, diverted all police units away from downtown -- Go fetch.
MADDIE: And then he sent his team into the museum.
Once everyone was in position, Jake was free to sneak out.
And rendezvous with Tiffany.
SINGER: * Well, no one told me about her *
* The way she lied Oh, come here.

We have a patientwith a penetrating chest wound.
Have surgeons standing by.
(siren wailing) His BP's bottoming out.
I'll bolus another liter of saline.
That's not gonna cut it.
We're still seven minutes out by my watch.
He's got half of that.
His torso's filling up with blood.
That shrapnel probably clipped his aorta.
Hen, you have no way of knowing that.
I could do a thoracotomy.
You want to cut him open in a moving ambulance?
I could just widen the opening that's already there.
That's a job for a surgeon,Hen.
I'll manually pinch the aorta just above the injury.
It's a job for a surgeon!
And even if you're lucky enough to find it, what then?
You're gonna cut off circulation in his lower limbs?
I'll preserve blood flow to the heart, lung, and brain.
Hen, no.
He's circling the drain, Chim.
You want to send him down it?
(machine beeping rapidly) He's in VTAC. He's about to code.

Too much blood loss.
Did a thoracotomy to stabilize him.
Are you kidding me? That's a surgeon's job.
CHIMNEY: Well, it's a job she's done and done well, so you might as well tell us where we're headed.
Hold on.

Thoracotomy in the field.
Wow. Someone needed a challenge?

Still looking for the car, but he'll turn up.
And then what?

No fingerprints, no DNA.
Just videos of a man in a mask attacking these women.
Still blaming yourself for losing him?
Because you didn't.
I had him, Lou.
Not your fault.
In fact, you're the reason why he's in hiding right now instead of targeting his next victim.

He knew my house.
How to get in, where to hide, where to put a camera.
How?
He studied you.
He used a drone to stalk his targets.
He learned your patterns, your movements.
You know, I thought someone was watching me, but I dismissed it.
I just moved in, so I thought I was being paranoid.
What else do you remember about that night?
Any detail at all might help us.
I remember everything.
I forgot that part.
Would you like a minute?
I just wanna get this over with.
You reported this as a break-in, not an attack.
I didn't wanna admit it happened.
I guess I thought if I didn't say it out loud, I could pretend it didn't.
Turn it off. Please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure it must be hard to see yourself.
That's not me anymore, so it's fine.
He stole so much from me that night.
I mean, physical items I can replace, but...
the pieces of me he took, I'm -- I'm not sure how to replace those.
I'm sorry, I don't recall any mention of missing items.
My necklace.
I was wearing it when he attacked me, and...
he took it with him when he left.
Are we done here? I think I've had enough.
Of course.
We'll have an officer walk you out.
* Thank you.
We need to go through those files again.
See if anybody else is missing personal items.
Yeah, those guys sometimes take souvenirs.

Because I can -- There is nothing to do.
Okay? We just...

MICHAEL: Yeah.
So talk later?
Yeah. Sure.
* You found something?
(exhales) Maybe.
Yeah, I've been going through his credit card purchases again.
Thought that was a dead end.
Well, at first glance, yeah, but then I figured, you know, maybe if I mapped out the places that he frequented, we'd get a fuller picture of his movements, you know?
Figure out where he'd go.
ATHENA: Well, he lives here.
His office is here.
These are his real estate listings.
Now, this seems to be off the beaten path for him.
What is it?
Coffee shop.
I've got seven charges in the past six months.
I just can't figure out why he'd go there.
Doesn't overlap with any of our victims.
I don't know, it's odd, but it's probably nothing.
Yeah, well, nothing seems to be all we got right now.
* No, I-I understand.
I just need to think about it. Do I have to decide now?
Okay, I'll let you know. Thanks.
Hi.
You okay?
I don't know.
The district attorney's been calling me about Greg's sentencing hearing.
They want me to make a victim impact statement.
Yeah, I think we're all making statements, right?
They said -- Letters.
We were all supposed to write letters about our hostage experience.
But I guess because I was victimized twice, they think I should make a personal statement.
In the courtroom.
So you would have to be in the same room with Greg.
I really thought this was all over.
That I wouldn't have to see him again.
But talking about what he did to me while he's sitting there looking at me?
I don't know if I can do it.
Then don't. Look, he pled guilty.
He's going to prison whether you're in the courtroom or not.
Yeah.
But not going makes me feel like a coward.
He's in jail.
But it still feels like he's the one with all the power.

You might want to send an ambulance.
Maybe more than one.

Don't try to get out.

I am at the intersection of La France and Maple.
I need DWP to shut down the power here.
JOSH: Copy that, 118.
DWP estimate ten minutes.
Vehicle is under downed power lines.
See if you can shave some time off that.
How's he doing?
No broken bones.
Just a couple of bumps and bruises.
Maybe a concussion.
But he fell through the roof.
Cardboard boxes bore the brunt of the fall.
You know, stunt guys still use 'em as crash pads.
But aren't those boxes usually empty?
* I thought these truck cabs are supposed to be grounded.

Let's get her out.
Carefully.
Thanks for the quick work on the power, Dispatch.
I'd say you're welcome, but our updates show they're still four minutes out.
BOBBY: If you didn't shut the power off, who did?
Seriously?

But never been trapped in an elevator either.
Look on the bright side.
There's worse places to be trapped.

DWP's working on restoring the power.
We recommend that people shelter in place until the power's restored.

That's sort of the problem.
I'm trapped inside.
You think you could send someone to get me out?
It's getting pretty cold.
Where did you say you were?
I'm in the walk-in freezer.
(dramatic music) MADDIE: You're stuck inside the freezer?
Yeah.
MADDIE: Okay. What's your name?
Gordon. Gordon Johnson.
Okay, Gordon. I'm Maddie.
There should be some kind of emergency release knob inside the freezer.
Have you looked for it?
It's frozen over.
Tried whacking it with a chateaubriand, but the ice is pretty thick.
Any idea when you can have someone sent out?
Power's out for half the city.
It might take some time.
Can you tell me how large the freezer is?
Probably about 15x30.
Good.
That's enough cubic feet of oxygen to last you a few hours.
Hours?
Hours? I can't be in here hours.
No, no, no. Gordon, don't panic.
The faster you breathe, the more air you'll use, so you need to slow your breathing.
Okay.
I don't wanna end up another frozen piece of meat in here.
That's why you need to conserve as much of your body heat as possible.
How?
Okay, I want you to look around and tell me everything you see that isn't frozen meat.
MADDIE: How we doing, Gordon?
(shivering) Pretty cold.
Tired too.
MADDIE: No, don't fall asleep, Gordon.
I need you to stay awake. Okay?
* (sliding, thudding) Gordon?
Gordon?
Gordon?
(radio chatter) LAFD. Gordon?
Okay, he's out. Probably hypothermic.
Let's cut him out now.
(saw beeps) Saw's dead. Need another battery.
Oh, and that was the last battery pack.
Too many car accidents in one day.
Couldn't we just break open this window?
Even if we could get in that way, how do we get him out? It's too small.
BOBBY: The unit should have an electronic emergency door release and without power -- Inside of that door is a frozen block of ice by now.
Yeah, well, so's Gordon if we don't get him out.
Maybe it just needs a jump.
(Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby") * SINGER: Yo, VIP.
Let's kick it!
Ice, ice, baby.
* Ice, ice, baby.
* All right, stop, collaborate, and listen * All set here.
HEN: Charging.
SINGER: * Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly *
* Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know * Clear!
Can you hit it again?
SINGER: * Light up a stage and wax a chump *
* Like a candle, dance Clear!
(electricity humming) SINGER: Ice, ice, baby.
Too cold, too cold.
(dramatic music) HEN: Pumping warm fluids.
89.9.
Dispatch, we got to him in time.
Think he's gonna be all right.
I'll give you a call back once they get us out.
Bye. Love you.
(chuckles) Kids okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Hmm.
Anyone you need to call?
I texted my office. They'll handle the rest.
No, I meant, you know, at home...
or something.
Oh, yeah. Oscar.
Oh. Oh, that's -- But he's not expecting me till 7:00.
Oh, okay. Yeah, that's good.
My dog.
Hmm.
I guess he's probably not good at returning texts.
The worst.
Yeah, I bet.
(both laugh) And to answer the question behind the question, no, I don't have anyone special waiting at home.
* (line ringing) RANSONE: Hey, Athena. What's going on?
Hey.
I think I found something.
Studio Self Storage.
Does he have a unit there?
You know, maybe that's where he's storing his trophies.
ATHENA: It would explain those coffee shop charges.
I need you to contact the manager.
Nobody's here because of the power.
All right, I'll find out.
This could be the break we need.
I can't say for sure, but I have a really strong feeling.
Yeah, see you soon.
* Dispatch, 727-L-30 at Studio Self Storage doing a business check.
Copy. 727-L-30.
* (footsteps running) (door slamming) (chain rattling) (dramatic musical flourish) (suspenseful music) * Dispatch, 727-L-30.
I'm gonna need backup and detectives dispatched to Studio Self Storage.
I have a possible -- (shouts) (grunting and scraping) MADDIE: 727-L-30, do you copy?
727-L-30, please respond.
Officer needs help.
727-L-30 at Studio Self Storage.
Her mic's still keyed open, but I can't talk to her.
(both grunting) DISPATCHER: All units, police, and fire RA, clear channel two.
Switch to Tac Channel 50.
Officer on open mic in distress.
Needs assistance.
727-L-30 at Studio Self Storage.
Bobby, that's Athena's call number.
Take him to the hospital and everyone else, on the engine, now, let's go.
(both grunting) (grunting and shouting) (sirens wailing) (grunting and shouting) (blows landing, clattering) Cap, they're telling us to switch to Tac 50.
(grunting and screaming) * (thudding) (gunshot) * OFFICER: Sir, the building's not clear.
* Captain Nash, she's here.
* HEN: Athena, can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Athena.
Pupils equal and reactive.
HEN: Might be a fractured rib.
(groans) Arm's definitely broken. Right closed fracture.
HEN: All right. Starting fluids.
CHIMNEY: Splinting the arm. You stay with us, Athena.
How's she doing?
I got -- I got him.
Suspect down?
WILLIAMS: Alive. Wounded.
RANSONE: Let's get a medic.
He can wait.
RANSONE: Dispatch, I need additional RAs to Studio Self Storage.
CHIMNEY: We need to move her!
* Bobby. Bobby.
(whimpering) I'm here. I'm here.
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Stay with us.
(doors whine) Finally.
'Cause I've had enough of this place.
No offense.
None taken.
Thank you.
Listen -- (phone ringing) Oh.
I'm sorry. One second.
Hey, Bobby.
Bobby?
* Okay.
But I don't understand. Prepare ourselves for what?
(sighs) Listen...
Bobby said your mom was pretty banged up.
She's gonna be okay, right?
Yes, she will.
But right now, she's hurt, and we've gotta be strong to help her through it.
Okay.
Okay.
(emotional music) * Oh, hey.
MICHAEL: Hey.
Mom, I'm so glad you're all right.
Oh, me too, baby.
Me too.
Harry.
It's okay.
Come here. Give me a hug.
But I don't wanna hurt you.
Oh, you won't.
A hug from my babies is exactly what I need.
* Ooh. Oh, see?
Ooh, I'm feeling better already.
NURSE: Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender.
It looks worse than it is.
Good. Then you'll be out of here soon.
BOBBY: She has to stay here for a few days.
I'm gonna stay with her.
Nurse is gonna set me up with a rollaway.
Oh, it's foolish.
I don't want anyone making a fuss.
I'm fine.
No, you're not fine.
I'm staying.
Just please let me do this.
Okay.
It'll be good to have the company.
* KAREN: (under breath) What else are you hiding?
HEN: Hey, Karen, the babysitter's here.
You ready?
Yeah, I'm not really feeling too well, so it's probably not a good idea for me to go to the hospital.
Just give Athena my love.
(cartoons play indistinctly) Are you sure?
Yeah, positive.
I hear Athena's gonna be okay.
Yeah, Buck called from the hospital and said that she's in rough shape, but nothing life-threatening.
Although I will be having nightmares about it for a while.
Yeah, hearing her struggle?
Not being able to help her?
But hey, gives us something new to talk about in therapy.
(laughs) Well, that's great.
'Cause I was starting to think that I was boring Frank.
You know, you could talk to him about going to court.
You think I should do it.
Maddie -- No.
I just think that you should consider what it means if you don't do it.
You keep saying that you feel powerless.
Maybe if you face him and tell him how you feel, you'll get your power back.
* (knocking) Hey.
Who's Imelda?
(upbeat music) * What am I looking at here?
Proof that Hen is cheating on me.
What? Hen would never do that.
I mean, not after what happened the last time she did that.
She's got all these dates and the name of a hotel.
I mean, is that when she's planning to meet up with this Imelda?
You find anything else on her phone?
Nothing. It was locked.
I took a picture of the screen.
Oh, did you use her thumb to unlock it while she was sleeping?
Ew. No.
Wait, do you do that?
Of course not!
Buck did it to me once after I got stabbed.
Anyways, look, it's just two text messages and a scrap of paper.
It probably means nothing.
There's a charge on our credit card.
A teppanyaki restaurant.
She said she took you there for your birthday.
Is that true?
(sighs) I cannot believe she lied about that.
I love teppanyaki.
See? Another lie.
Right to my face.
She's using me to lie to you.
We barely survived the last time.
And now we have two kids to think of.
I really wish I knew how to help you, Karen.
(dramatic music) You got anything to drink?
Yeah. I got coffee.
* I'll get us something stronger.
Mm-hmm.
* Thank God. I found 'em like this.
I don't think she can drive home.
(upbeat music) (gum bubble pops) * Karen, I thought you were sick.
I am sick.
I'm sick of the lies.
Lies.
I'm sick of the betrayal.
So much betrayal.
Hey, Chim, maybe we should give them some privacy.
Why do I have to leave? This is my apartment.
And Hen is the one who's cheating.
Wha --I'm not cheating.
BOTH: Ugh!
I saw the texts.
And this, this is when you were gonna meet her at that hotel.
Imelda.
(scoffs) Imelda is Dr. Royce.
Dr. Imelda Royce.
Oh, a doctor.
At least that's better than the last one.
I'm a doctor too!
I have a PhD. Wait.
Dr. Royce is that surgeon -- the surgeon you met the day that you put your hand in that man's chest.
Ah!
Which...
was really stupid and reckless, by the way.
Okay, maybe you should stop talking now.
She had a meet-cute over an open chest wound.
That's not right!
It wasn't a meet-cute.
It was just a meet.
And I was talking to Dr. Royce --Imelda -- about what it took to get into med school.
These are the dates of when I can take my MCATs.
Wait, you're thinking about going to medical school?
Since when?
I don't know.
That's why I didn't say anything.
I mean...
it was just such a crazy idea.
(heartfelt music) Oh, baby, no.
(laughing) That's not crazy.
Oh, my God, you'd be an amazing doctor.
(laughs) I'm so sorry I doubted you.
I'm so relieved.
I'm not.
The kids forget something?
No.
You know, May is at the salon, I dropped Harry off at the Andersons', and...
thought I came to check in on you.
Well, I'm...
not fine.
But I am managing.
Yeah, me too.
Seeing her like that just -- Part of the job, I know that, but...
seeing it, hearing it -- Makes you feel powerless.
When that gun went off, when I thought I'd lost her, I -- I know I didn't, but I keep coming going back to what if.
And I --I don't know what to do with that feeling.
You know, a wise man once told me that he couldn't offer me any sage advice.
All he could offer me was a hammer.
What do you want me to do with a hammer?
I never did like that fireplace.
SINGER: * Yeah, life sure can try * BOBBY: Michael, Athena's gonna kill us.
Don't worry.
I'll build you guys a new one.
SINGER: * When the bones are good *
* The rest don't matter * Yeah, the paint could peel * The glass could shatter * Let it rain * 'Cause you and I remain the same *
* When there ain't a crack in the foundation * Yeah!
SINGER: * Baby, I know any storm we're facing *
* Will blow right over while we stay put *
* The house don't fall when the bones are good * That one goes in a frame.
Think you guys should pay me for my services.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Let's take a look at the pictures first.
Get over here.
Okay, Ms. Nash, your turn.
No, I don't think so.
I'm in no condition for a photo shoot.
Mom, I want you in my prom pictures.
Oh, look at me, May.
I see you.
And I couldn't be more proud.
You got him. You won.
Those bruises show what kind of fighter you really are and I want pictures to remember this moment.
SINGER: * And we're still standing * SINGERS: * When the bones are good * Yes, hi. It's Josh Russo.
I've thought about it.
I'd like to give a statement in court.
SINGERS: * 'Cause you and I remain the same * You're not happy for her?
SINGERS: * When there ain't a crack in the foundation * I just can't get past the fact that she's leaving me.
SINGERS: * The house don't fall when the bones are good * SINGER: * Mm My Dr. Wilson.
SINGER: * When the bones are good *
* Hey, make sure you get my good side.
SINGERS: * The rest SINGER: * Baby, it don't really matter * Looks good.
(laughter) HARRY: All right.
Get it, Mama.
* Pacific West 1135.
We were heading from Phoenix into Union Station.
We've crashed somewhere close to the LA County line.
Okay, so how many -- CALLER: There are multiple injuries.
This is a mass casualty situation.
You've gotta send out every available RA unit.
We need USAR for search and rescue, LAPD for traffic control.
We're gonna need a mobile command center.
I'll call them now.
Okay.
It seems like you've done this before.
CALLER: Yeah, but I was on your end of the line.
I used to be a 9-1-1 dispatcher.

* Well, that long black train *
* Got my baby and gone *

Hey.
What can I get you?
I'm a sucker for a sidecar on a train.
Guys, this is not a subway car!
MAN: All right, sorry.
(scoffs) MAN: Sorry.
Did you know at a Ukrainian wedding, the bride has to keep her shoes on?
'Cause otherwise the guests will steal them and drink wine out of them.
It's good luck.
Well, unless I missed a few stops, I'm pretty sure we are not about to roll into Kiev.
So...
now I get to ask you the question that I ask everyone on here: why the train?
Spent a lot of time in Europe, fell in love with train travel.
Yeah, but this is Phoenix to LA.
It isn't exactly the Orient Express.
Well, Phoenix is home and LA used to be home, so.
Somebody waiting for you there?
No.
He stopped waiting for me a long time ago.
Summer camp?
It's all he can talk about.
Some of the other kids from school are going.
It's only two weeks.
Time.
Whoa, whoa.
Two weeks away from home?
Isn't Chris kind of young for that?
I mean, what if something happens?
What if he gets homesick?
I'm pretty sure I brought in the brochure so you guys can make me feel better about him going.
Clearly, you did not think that plan through to its logical conclusion.
I started going to sleepaway camp when I was 8.
I loved it. Camp Weegeewagen.
Eedee-idee-odee-ooh-hoo!
Looked forward to it every year.
Yeah, but Christopher's a city kid.
So was I.
St. Paul is a city.
If you say so.
(laughter) I'm just trying to imagine trying to sell Denny on the idea of two weeks without the internet.
It's pretty exciting.
They even have this farm-to-fork program where the kids pick veggies and cook 'em for dinner.
That sounds a lot like child labor.
(sighs) Okay.
(anxious music) * Damn it!
Hmm.
I gotta get above a 511.
504 is pretty good.
Getting into medical school at this point in my life is hard enough.
I can't afford to be an average applicant.
Hey, there is nothing average about you.
You just started studying this. Give yourself a break.
Yeah. Hey, come on.
You are gonna rock the MCATs.
* Hen, you're brilliant.
You don't need a test to prove that.
(phone chimes) Bobby, why is your wife asking me if she could hold May's graduation party at my house?
Our living room is kind of under construction right now.
I'm in the hospital for four days and you two lose your damn mind!
I told you, Athena.
I was trying to make Bobby feel better.
What about making me feel better?
I'm the one with the broken arm and 50 people coming for a party in two weeks.
I didn't think we were still having a party, Mom.
You just got out of the hospital.
May, you are graduating from high school.
There will be a party and a cake and photographs with a fireplace that does not look like a pile of rubble.
Are you gonna finish taking it down?
'Cause I can help.
No, no, no.
You will not. Your father broke it.
He's gonna fix it.
Absolutely. Okay?
(phone chimes) I'm gonna go home, do some sketches, and I will come back here in the morning, okay?
Good, 'cause Hen says there's not enough room at her place for parking for all of our guests.
Okay, this is silly.
We really don't need to have a party.
Since when don't you wanna have a party?
Dad, don't you have a doctor's appointment in the morning?
ATHENA: Michael.
Your results are in.
You want me to come with you?
No. No, Athena, I got it.
The doctor is gonna go over the scans with me and, you know, then we'll know what's...
what's next.
Good news.
That's what's next.
True that.
MADDIE: It's good.
I did a lot of research, you know, on the dos and don'ts of making a victim impact statement.
I totally believe that.
It's very thorough.
It's terrible, isn't it?
No.
Look, when I read this, I know exactly what Greg did to you.
What I don't understand is how you...
feel about any of it.
Does it matter?
(sighs) What do you think?
I mean, is this really what you wanna say to him?
I think the judge would discourage the use of curse words.
Okay, so then...
find new words.
Your words.
Look, this moment is about you.
It's not about what you're supposed to say.
It should come from your heart.
(emotional music) * (yawns) I am so sorry.
That -- (both laugh) That had nothing to do with you, I promise.
I am trying not to be offended.
I just need to refill.
(upbeat music) (train whistle blows) (dramatic music) * MAN: Really?
* Really?
'Scuse me.
Look, man, self-expression is kind of my right, okay?
Not when it infringes on my right to peace and quiet.
Look, I got a huge show at the Roxy, all right?
I don't care!
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't we hit the pause button here, all right?
I think a little peace and quiet would be a great idea all around.
She doesn't have a pause button.
(metal clunking) (electricity zapping) That's not good.
(train whistle blows) Come on, man. She's a kid.
(brakes screeching) MAN: What the hell is that?
(whistle blowing) (brakes screeching) (people gasping) (whistle blows) (people screaming) (glass shattering) (metal screeching) * (people screaming) (phone buttons beep) (siren whirs) (synth pop music) * (grunts) Now.
(engine turning over) Oh --ha-ha!
Hey!
There you go!
(laughs) Awesome, Dad. You did it.
Not bad, right?
Yeah.
Not bad at all.
(bells dinging) Hey! Slow down!
5 MPH! 5!
Morons. Kill somebody.
So...
now that you got it running, what's the plan?
Sneaking out when I'm not looking?
Why would we do that? We've only been here -- Three nights!
Three nights for which I have not been paid.
(dramatic music) Look, I thought we talked -- RORY: Three nights is my limit.
I want you out of here.
(train whistle blowing) You mean now?
Get yourself gone, or I will have you towed.
* Hey, this is --this is the last of it.
There's a food bank not too far from here.
I'll --I'll hit it in the morning.
Hand me a rag.
Thanks.
Stay inside, Milo.
I'll be right back.
* Dude.
You cannot do this to us.
* You told me I had a week to find a job.
(laughing) I never said that to you.
You pay, you stay. Those are the rules.
* Look, I came in here because a son should never see his father have to beg.
But I'm still always telling him, "Just keep your head up.
"Just keep your head up because if you don't, you won't see all the good things that are coming." (tense music building) I don't know what's next.
What's next?
(train whistle blowing) What's next is reality!
(metal crashing) (man screaming) (metal screeching) MAN: Oh, God!
(man moaning) * Milo!
Are those all your Realtor Rapist files?
Please do not call him that.
Yes.
I asked Lou to drop 'em off so that I could be ready for my meeting with Dr. Sanford.
The victims' advocate?
Mm-hmm.
Going to trial, testifying in court, it can be overwhelming, so...
she's gonna help all of them get through it.
(knocking on door) Okay.
Ooh, that must be her.
Can I get the door?
Oh, I'm fine.
I still got one good arm.
Ah, Dr. Sanford.
Athena Grant. Come in.
Thank you. And it's Kara, please.
Although I'm sure my mom would want you to keep the Dr. part.
It is so good to meet you, Sergeant Grant.
Oh, Athena, please. Come in.
Pardon our dust.
While I was out, my home turned into one of those cable remodeling shows.
Surprise! It's still not done.
Oh, it's a lovely home.
Well, I set us up in here.
You have the case files for the other victims.
Oh, yes.
I'm sure you have specific questions, but I thought it would be easier to just go through all of them.
(dramatic music) (clears throat) Great.
So...
where do you wanna start?
ABBY: Pacific West 1135.
We were heading from Phoenix into Union Station.
We've crashed somewhere close to the LA County line.
Okay, so how many -- ABBY: There are multiple injuries.
This is a mass casualty situation.
You've gotta send out every available RA unit.
We need USAR for search and rescue, LAPD for traffic control.
We're gonna need a mobile command center.
I'll call them now.
Okay.
MADDIE: It seems like you've done this before.
Yeah, but I was on your side of the line.
I used to be a 9-1-1 dispatcher.
TODD: Milo!
Milo, can you hear me?
(woman screams) * (sirens wailing) * Captain Bobby Nash.
Captain Janet Reese.
More houses are en route. Search dogs as well.
The debris field is pretty far and wide.
We've had our hands full with all the passenger cars down here, but there are reports that folks are trapped up there.
We just can't get to 'em yet.
Buck, Eddie, go have a look.
See if there's a way to secure that car so we can get those people out.
Is USAR on the way?
Dispatch assures me a heavy rescue is coming.
All right, guys, let's gear up. Let's go!
* Please, if you can just let me up into the car.
Please! I've gotta get up there.
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We can't let you inside.
It's too dangerous.
I know it's dangerous.
I need to get up in that car.
I hear you. I'm sorry.
Wait, are you from the 118?
Yeah.
BUCK: Abby?
* Buck.
* Wait, you were on the train.
Yeah. I've gotta -- We need to get you checked out.
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I need to get up there.
What? No, that's crazy!
No, no, Abby, Abby, stop!
I'm trying to find somebody!
Okay. Well, just tell us who.
We'll go -- My fiancé!
* He fell asleep and I went to the bar.
Okay. Can you give us a description?
That's him.
We were in that top car right there, all the way in the back.
* We'll find him.
Um...
what's his name?
Sam.
Egan.
Sam.
I got it.
Thank you, Buck.
Oh.
Don't worry about it.
We'll bring him back to you.
* I promise.
* (metal creaking) (grunting) * We got somebody.
EDDIE: Cap, be advised.
Another black tag up here about halfway.
BOBBY: Copy that.
* (metal creaking) Sam! (grunts) Sam! Sam, can you hear me?
(groans) (metal creaks) (groans) Sam.
Hey, Sam.
How you feeling?
(groaning) It hurts...
hurts when I breathe.
(wheezing) Please.
My fiancée.
She's on the train.
(groaning) Yeah, hey, hey. She's okay.
(coughing painfully) Cap, I got a passenger pinned up here.
Looks like the support beam from the observation deck broke through the floor.
Need you to send up the jaws, okay?
BOBBY: Copy that. Coming right up.
We got you, Sam.
Help is on its way.
We need jaws and the ram.
On it, Cap.
These are the last of the walking wounded from the bottom of this car.
What's the word from up top?
Two dead, one trapped so far.
JANET: Captain Nash, search dog detail just landed.
Can you spare a couple medics?
All right, Hen, Chim, go with them.
Are you sure, Cap?
(metal screeching) (all grunting) * We need all the paramedics we have on the ground.
What about up there?
BOBBY: I got it.
* (metal creaking) * (grunts) You got it, Buck?
All right.
* He's got a collapsed lung from the blunt force.
O2 levels are dropping.
I can relieve the pressure, but we gotta move this beam off him.
(grunts) Still too heavy.
It's not gonna budge.
All right. Let's try the hydraulic ram.
Got it, Buck?
Yeah.
(grunts) (metal creaks) * (Georgia screaming) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
We got somebody else!
(grunting) * (gasping) EDDIE: How you doing?
(groans) My side really hurts.
I'm gonna take a peek.
* Oh.
Force of the crash pushed her leg up into her torso.
What? (gasping) It's gonna hurt a little bit.
(whimpers) All right.
(screams) (whimpering) There's still a pulse in her foot.
Blood's still pumping to her.
All right. That's a beam.
Come on.
Be right back, okay?
Okay.
(both grunting) Hey. What's going on?
They're both trapped by the same beam.
We take the pressure off of him and we're squeezing her.
Which one has the better shot?
Injuries are different.
The risk is the same.
What are we saying? We gotta pick who we save?
I'm saying I don't think we can save 'em both.
(dramatic musical flourish) Now, it'll be hard on Alexis because she's still struggling with admitting that it even happened.
Well, it's not uncommon for victims to distance themselves from the crime.
Yeah. Now, Michelle.
I think she'll be great on the stand but she is the one that I worry about the most.
Why is that?
All of her statements are peppered with, "I should've known." "I should have realized." She blames herself.
(sighs) Thinks if she had done something differently, maybe it wouldn't have happened.
Yeah. Right.
I can't help but notice that there's a file missing from this table.
(serious music) * (sighs) His attack on me was nothing like what he did to these other women.
* Now, your priority should be them.
I don't think it's fair to compare traumas.
And from what I read, his attack on you was pretty brutal.
Well, it happened pretty fast and I don't remember most of it.
Everyone says I'm lucky that I don't.
They're wrong.
Yes, sometimes the brain's way of protecting us is to block out painful memories.
But I've been doing this a long time and I have never had anyone feel better because they didn't know what happened to them.
You were never here to talk about these other women.
Were you?
* I'm here for you.
* Well, I'm not ready.
* I'll leave this here for when you are.
* (tense music) * (man grunting) MEDIC: All right, hold on. Here we go.
* TODD: Milo!
* Help!
Sir, are you hurt?
No. I'm looking for my son.
Hey, do you know where he was when the train crashed?
He was in the RV.
I left him when I was talking to Rory.
All right, tell us about your son.
He's 15.
Black hair, green shirt.
Do you have anything with his scent on it?
Maybe help us track him?
No, I don't.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Milo used this to clean his hands, but it's gotta have antifreeze or coolant on it.
That's okay, Richard's trained to track only human scents.
Chemicals don't confuse him. What you got buddy?
What you got?
(dog barks) * All right, Sam. This is for the pain.
* Keep him talking.
(metal creaking) * It's her...
or me, isn't it?
No.
No, that's not what we do.
So tell me about your fiancée.
When's the wedding?
June.
She wants to wait...
till the girls are done with school.
You're a father.
Yeah.
(distant sirens wailing) Tess...
Natalie.
* BRENDAN: Good boy, Richard. Good boy.
(dog barking) Milo.
Sir, stand back so we can do our work, okay?
* HEN: Milo, can you hear me?
Yeah.
Dad?
Right here, son.
We're gonna get you out.
You're lying very still, Milo.
Is it because you're afraid or because you're having trouble moving?
I don't think I can move.
What's happening? Is something wrong with him?
Just give us a minute to take a look, okay?
Pulse is strong. Milo, can you wiggle your toes?
* Normal reaction.
C1 vertebra's intact, so I'm guessing it's not a spinal -- but I can't seem to locate the occiput ligaments.
Atlanto-occipital dislocation?
I've seen it in car accidents.
Never seen someone still talking after.
All right, Command, we need an extraction team on the north side of train car two with a straight shot to a medevac copter.
And contact the children's hospital.
Have them prep the neurosurgery OR.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's going on?
She said it wasn't a spinal -- Stand back.
It's called an internal decapitation.
His spine is intact.
It's just no longer connected to his skull.
But he's alive. He's talking.
As long as his spine remains intact, he's still got a good shot of surviving this.
We just need to get him to a hospital so the surgeons can reattach his ligaments, okay?
We need to find a way to cool our saline, preserve as much nerve and tissue as possible.
Right. I saw an ice cooler over here.
I'll get some ice.
* (helicopter blades whirring) * (grunting) Okay, I'm calling it.
We start with the girl, we get her out.
Copy that.
BUCK: No.
It's gonna crush Sam's other lung.
He's gonna die.
I am aware of that.
The protocol dictates that we save whomever has the better chance and Eddie's saying that's the girl.
No.
Her vitals are stronger.
He's starting to decompensate.
If we have to choose -- We do.
We can't move that steel beam.
(rumbling) (Georgia whimpers) (Sam grunts) Okay. Okay, you're right.
The beam is steel.
But the skin on this thing, the skin is stainless.
That's much thinner.
I could go outside, I could cut a piece out, pull the girl through, and that will buy us enough room to save Sam.
No. This car hasn't been secured.
That's why we're working on the inside.
If this thing topples, we can ride it down, but if you're on the outside -- Yeah, I know.
I will be crushed by 100 tons of train car, and I know that is a lot heavier than a fire truck.
But Bobby -- Buck, stop.
All right, I know you made a promise.
What promise?
To his fiancée.
I promised I would bring him back to her.
What?
To Abby.
His fiancée's Abby.
Okay.
No. Look, it's not just about her.
Okay, he's a father. He has two daughters.
Stop. You're too close to this. This is too risky.
Well, I am willing to take the risk.
It's not yours to take.
You can't just rush into any dangerous situation and assume it's gonna be okay.
'Cause sometimes it's not and I am tired of being on the wrong side of those hospital visits.
Bobby. I am not Athena.
What did you just say to me?
Enough.
We don't have time for this.
* Buck, come on.
* (dramatic music) * (Athena screams) (both grunting) (Athena crying out) (bone snapping) * (sirens wailing) (indistinct radio chatter) * (phone buzzing and ringing) * Hi, sweetie.
TESS: Abby, are you with my dad?
I'm not right now.
TESS: What's going on?
Are you in LA yet?
Dad hasn't texted.
He always texts.
I know. I know.
He does.
There was an accident on the train.
TESS: What? Oh, my God! What happened?
But I don't want you to be worried because your dad is in the best hands.
TESS: Is he okay?
* Kay, we have to secure that car ASAP.
We got injured people inside and it's been creaking like it's ready to go.
(metal creaking) How we doing, Sam?
(groans) Okay.
How's the girl?
EDDIE: She's hanging in there.
* I'm really sorry.
For what?
That you got hurt.
You were really nice to me.
Say, you're gonna miss your gig.
(laughs) Neither of you guys are missing anything.
We're getting you out.
* (metal creaking) * (metal creaking) * (grunts) * All right, send up the basket!
(metal creaking) * All right, your turn, Sam.
* HEN: On three.
One, two, three.
* Almost there, Sam!
(metal creaking) (gasping) * HEN: All right.
* It's gonna be a little cold.
TODD: Afraid he's used to it.
We aren't living in the RV by choice.
What are you talking about, Dad?
We're on an adventure.
Hey, what do we always say?
Maybe not the best thing to say right now, kid.
Keep your head up 'cause -- (wheezing) What just happened?
The automatic signals from Milo's brain stopped telling him to breathe.
We need to put a tube down his throat.
Administering succinylcholine.
This will stop the gag reflex.
* CHIMNEY: I'll hold him steady.
HEN: All right.
* All right.
* Easy.
* Inflating balloon to keep steady.
* Okay, switch.
* (helicopter blades whirring) (breathing heavily) Abby? Is she here?
She's down there waiting for you, Sam.
* (hopeful music) * Medevac's here.
Airway's patent.
Okay, what does that mean?
It means he's gonna be okay.
Because she's brilliant.
Way to go, Wilson.
* You talk to the girls?
You're so amazing and brave.
They're gonna be really proud of you.
Hey. Hey, man.
Thank you.
Buck.
Thank you.
You're Buck?
Good to meet you, Sam.
* (indistinct radio chatter) * You okay?
* What's next?
* I told you I don't remember much about being attacked.
It was behind me, and then all of a sudden, it gets hazy.
The next clear memory I have is being in the back of the ambulance and the look on my husband's face.
I thought I was dying because he thought I was.
But you didn't.
You survived.
But I shouldn't have.
He had me dead to rights.
Came up behind me.
I didn't even know he was there.
I've been a police officer for 30 years.
I love my job and I'm good at what I do because I've always been able to trust my gut.
But now?
You're doubting yourself.
I should've called for backup before I went inside.
Maybe.
But that doesn't mean that what he did to you was your fault.
Maybe not, but I scared the hell out of my family and myself.
And now I'm left feeling like I can't trust my instincts anymore.
How the hell am I supposed to go back out there feeling like this?
You're not going back out there tomorrow.
(emotional music) It'll take time to heal.
But if that part of me never does?
And that's why I was struggling.
I couldn't figure out what to say to you.
How to make you understand what you did to me and to the people I care about.
* But then I realized I don't have to.
Because I'm gonna walk out of this courthouse and I'm gonna have some drinks with friends and you're gonna go sit in a box.
* Every morning, you will wake up and think about why you're there.
You will have to think of me.
* But I can choose to never think about you again.
* Are you sure?
I don't like to brag, but I'm pretty good at reading these things.
The tumor has shrunk by almost 30%.
Congratulations.
This is...
* This is really happening.
* ATHENA: It's a miracle.
You know, I think Dr. Burman might be offended by that word.
Thank you so much.
But I am feeling pretty miraculous myself.
I know it's not a clean bill of health or anything, but -- It's good news, Michael. Be happy.
When do you wanna tell the kids?
Tonight.
You know, we can tell 'em together.
ATHENA: Okay, what time?
Uh, you know, I'm not sure.
There's something that I need to do.
I'll call you later.
(upbeat music) Hold the elevator!
* Hi.
Hi.
So where were we?
Hi.
Hi.
Thanks for meeting me.
How's --how's Sam?
He's good.
They're expecting a full recovery.
Good. He seems like a great guy.
He said the same thing about you.
And I will never be able to thank you enough for what you did.
Just doing my job. That's all.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about it this way.
I had actually wanted to talk to you about everything while I was in town.
That's what you're sorry for?
(emotional music) When did you know that you were...
leaving me for good?
Well -- You know, was it -- was it in Morocco or Paris or Dublin or -- or did you know when we were at the airport and I was kissing you good-bye and promising you that I would wait for you?
Did you know then that you were never coming back to me?
I thought I would.
Look, I was a person whose life revolved around everybody else's problems.
I had no identity other than...
the people that I was helping.
My 9-1-1 calls, my dying mother.
I just had no sense of self.
I had to leave everything that I knew so that I could remember who I actually am.
And you did, right?
I mean, you did remember, but...
You still didn't come home.
Yeah, I know.
* I think I was afraid that if I came back, I would become that person again.
Because I missed you. I wanted to see you.
But I didn't trust myself.
Because being here, being with me, you might lose yourself again?
Yeah.
* I'm glad to see you happy, Abby.
You deserve it.
* (cheers and applause) Oh, we are so proud of you, baby.
My little girl, ready to start a new chapter.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
So do you, Dad.

There was something I wanted to talk to you about.

It's been 30 years since I've been a civilian.

You know that I didn't have a choice in that.
I promised my parents.
When you were nine!
A promise they had no right to ask you to make, by the way.
You don't owe them anything. You could tell him the truth!
All I need to tell him is that our parents are coming to LA.
How do you think he's gonna take it?
You invited Mom and Dad to visit?
Yes.
And you're just telling me now.
Well, you know, you were in Texas, and...I wasn't completely sure they were coming.
You're just telling me now that they have crossed the California state line, and it's too late for me to talk you out of it.
Though...I'm still not sure who talked you into it.
No one.
I guess I just...
want my little girl to have a normal family.
You know, uncles and grandparents that she might actually know.
Well, then maybe you shoulda gotten knocked up by a guy who has one of those.
Well, that is not funny.
Maybe...
maybe this'll be a good thing, you know?
You could talk to Mom and Dad, tell them how you've been feeling.
Could be good for your therapy, right?
Or cause me to need more of it.
I think I'm willing to try.
And...
maybe Mom and Dad are too.
Fine.
But we're a team, okay?
A-a united front.
You are not allowed to leave me alone with them.
I won't, I promise.
And don't worry. Chimney's gonna be there too.
And Albert.
Albert's coming?
<i>♪ Here we go, it's tricky to rock a rhyme ♪</i> <i>♪ To rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky ♪</i> Okay, so why must I be there?
Because.
I have to meet Maddie's family. You're my family.
Ergo, you have to meet Maddie's family.
Is this a punishment?
Yes!
Now, shut up and dribble.
You know, Buck was right. You are being weird.
He thinks you're hiding something.
<i>♪ It's tricky to rock a rhyme ♪</i> <i>♪ It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky ♪</i> Because I am!
Maddie told me a secret, a really terrible, life-altering Buckley family secret that Buck can never know about.
She told <i>you?
I know, right?</i> What the hell was she thinking?
Everybody knows I can't keep a secret!
Except this time, I really have to.
I can't tell anyone.
Except you.
Oh...no.
What do you mean, no?
I can't tell Hen or Bobby about it.
We all work with Buck.
Yeah, and I live with Buck.
But you're my brother.

On the phone with Dr. Copeland.
Emergency therapy session.
Again?
Yeah.
He had to ask her for advice on some, uh, de-escalation techniques. What, is he afraid his parents' visit is gonna turn into a hostage situation?
What?
What do you think they're like?
The parents, I mean.
I mean, I look at Maddie...
and then I look at Buck, and I'm like...
"There's a story there." You have no idea.
None of us has any idea.
Just too bad, 'cause you know...
if we <i>all</i>knew, we could talk about what we know, and then we'd all know it.
No one would be stuck keeping anything to themselves, alone, with no one to talk to about some potentially explosive information they really wish they didn't know.

No.
Definitely not. Kay.
It seemed like such a silly call at first, a complaint about some kids, and then someone shot her.
What?
This woman died while you were on the phone with her?
Yeah. I mean, Josh was on the call, too, and he said I did everything right, but...
all I keep thinking is, "What if I'd sent police sooner?" Dad, don't -- Hey, you know, am I allowed to be a little bit concerned that my daughter just heard her first homicide?
No.
No?
No!
Look, I can't have you and Mom mad at me about this.
You promised me you'd be supportive, so...Dad up.
Okay. Okay.
Dadding up.
Josh was on the call with you, right?
Okay, so he could have jumped in if you missed something.
Yes, and Josh said that too.
I just don't know how to shake off the feeling that there was something else that I could've done, you know?
Oh, baby, your life is just moving beyond my level of experience.
I mean, you were never a first responder, but you were married to one.
Mom must have talked to you about this stuff.
Not really.
She never brought that kinda stuff home.
She always said she left her job behind when she took off the uniform at the end of the day.
All I have is a polo.
Listen.
Baby, I don't know what to tell you except maybe ask your mother.
<i>♪</i> You get the files I sent you?
Took me a while to get through 'em all.
How many lawsuits can one woman file against her neighbors -- complaints to the building department, zoning board, and for some reason, the Department of Waste Management?
Come on, Athena, everybody knows you're supposed to bring your trash cans in before 8:00 p. m.
Yeah. I see she also filed some police reports too.
Yeah. Delia Narwood was waging war against the entire cul-de-sac.
Let's go find out who decided to return fire.
She said we were running an unlicensed business out of our home.
All sidewalk vendors require business, tax, and health permits.
Do ya have those permits?
<i>She traumatized my daughter...</i> over a lemonade stand?
What kind of person does that?
I think she was just deeply unhappy.
You know the type -- they're miserable, and they want everyone else to be miserable too.
We won her over in the end, though...
with baked goods.
Zucchini bread.
Baking has become Rita's new obsession.
Every time I turn around, she's covered in flour.
Well, we're just home so much more than I thought we'd be, I figured I needed a hobby.
The sourdough -- super challenging.
Because the starter, it's really hard to feed and keep alive -- So..
the day of the block party.
Yes.
Such a lovely gathering.
I mean, up until the...
murder. That was Delia.
Never missed an opportunity to ruin things for everyone else.
It's no wonder so many people wished her ill.
Yeah, she totally had it comin'.
Joe, they're here investigating a murder.
Maybe you shouldn't -- Well, they know we didn't kill her.
You do know that, right?
We saw the police report you filed.
We know what she did.
Archie!
Please tell me you didn't get into her yard again.
Oh, my God, Archie!
Oh, my God!
What's wrong?
Archie!
<i>She poisoned him.</i> If we hadn't got him to the vet when we did...
Who does that to a dog?
And you had words with her afterwards?
I said I hoped she'd burn in Hell.
And look...wishes come true.
So we've got someone who steals mail, terrorizes small children, and poisons adorable dogs, and that's our victim.
Meanwhile, all of our suspects have alibis -- each other.
<i>Murder on the Orient Express.</i> Maybe they all did it.
I got wine --red, white, sparkling, in case you wanna do any celebratory toasts, and tequila.
Not sure why we needed two bottles.
Those are for me.
You're wearing jeans.
Well, I was told I was not allowed to wear jeans.
You stop whining. Pre-heat the oven.
350. Whoa!
We're baking stuff?
Baked brie.
Fig jam.
When did you start liking fig?
Hey.
And I think we're ready.
Dad!
Maddie.
Mom! You guys did not have to bring presents.
We're grandparents now. Spoiling comes with the job.
Mr. and Mrs. Buckley, hi, I'm Howard Han.
It's nice to finally meet you both.
Hi, Howard. Please let me get these for you.
Thank you. Thanks.
Hey. Evan.
You look good.
Ah, so do you.
Uh, this is my brother Albert.
And Buck's roommate.
It's a pleasure to meet you both.
Buck. You're still letting people call you that.
It's just a nickname, Mom. Ugh.
Oh, you guys don't like nicknames?
But Maddie -- Is the name on my birth certificate.
Would anyone like a drink?
We have many options.
I believe I'll start with tequila.
So Howard, do...
people call you Howard?
Yes. Yes, they do.
Please, this way.
Mrs. Buckley.
We got this.
United front.
I'm glad you guys had a nice drive.
We saw a lot of the country.
The first few days, there was nothing but rain, then we got here, blue skies and sunshine.
Yeah, we had a lotta rain earlier in the year, but, uh, lately, it's been dry.
Hmm.
I-I can't believe you drove all the way across the country in an RV --that sounds exciting.
Statistically speaking, it seemed the safest way to travel right now.
Yeah. We didn't wanna take any chances, given Maddie's condition and it being a high-risk pregnancy.
Well, no, it's not really high-risk -- Oh, she's over 35.
That puts her at a higher risk, so we all need to be extra careful.
The baby's fine, Mom. But you don't wanna take any chances.
Not when you've waited this long.
Wow.
Uh, she was just waiting for the right time.
The right guy.
God knows it wasn't Doug.
Okay.
Let's not talk about him.
Of course, I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm so happy to see you happy.
Now, Evan, Maddie tells us that you've been seeing a therapist?
She did?
I'm gonna get some water.
Anything we should be worried about there?
No. Ha ha, no. Of course not.
It's --that's the job, you know? It can be stressful.
It's --it's good to try and get ahead of it.
You know, your father and I went to see a therapist.
Uh, really? When?
Well, after all this business with Maddie and the husband who shall not be named, we felt like there were some things we needed to work through.
So you...you went and talked to a therapist about my problems?
It wasn't as if you wanted to talk to us about them.
Buck had to call to tell us that Doug was dead.
Well, I didn't want you to find out on <i>Dateline.</i> You know what, I'm gonna start bringing this stuff into the kitchen.
Would anybody like a refill while I'm in there?
I'll help.
Yeah, uh...
me --me too.
Evan seems good.
After you called, I was expecting...
I don't know what.
But he seems fine.
Yeah, I think he's better at that than we think.
Seeming fine.
Hey.
Hey.
Got a call about our crime scene this morning.
A uni was driving by and noticed someone had broken the seal on the front door.
Someone broke into Delia's house?
Mm-hmm. Ransacked the place.
Well, why do you look so happy about it?
'Cause when I went over to see what was missing...
I found...this.
Hmm. Some kinda white powder?
Uh-huh. Smelled like flour.
With a hint of sourdough.
Baking has become Rita's new obsession.
Zucchini bread.
Whatever Rita the baker was looking for has gotta be in one of these boxes.
The techs took everything outta that house that wasn't nailed down.
Hmm. Crowder.
What?
I have an open envelope here addressed to Jeanine R. Crowder.
I don't remember talking to anyone with that last name.
Do you?
No. What was the house number?
24320.
That's, um...
Rita Ambrose.
Nope.
Jeanine Crowder.
Wanted for larceny, fraud, identity theft, <i>and</i>bigamy.
Rita is not Rita.
And Delia didn't just know that.
She had the evidence to prove it.
Evidence that Rita didn't want us to find.
Rita!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
My wife is not a murderer!
Sorry to have to be the bearer of bad news, but she is also not your wife.
She's under arrest for bigamy.
You know about Marshall? We thought your other husband's name was Jerome.
Oh. Damn it, now you know about him too.
Rita!
Honey.
I can explain everything.
Found the gun in the kitchen. Okay.
That one might be a little harder to explain.
Hey.
Hey.
Didn't expect you home so early.
Thought you were at some pool party.
Yeah. Didn't feel like staying.
Is Mom home?
No, she's at work tonight.
Is everything okay?
I took that call the other day.
The lady who got shot and fell into her pool?
Mm, yeah, pool party maybe not the thing to take your mind off your job.
I get that I need to learn how to let go, you know, take off the uniform and leave the job behind.
Well, that is certainly how your mother does it.
I-I've never been able to compartmentalize that much.
Okay, well, how do you do it?
I mean, you've been a first responder a really, really long time, so...
I mean, not that you're...
Yes, it's true.
I have been doing this job longer than you've been alive.
But no, I didn't always know how to deal with the stresses that come with it. For a long time, my coping mechanism was a mix of vodka and Percocet.
Which I do not recommend.
Copy that.
May, it's natural...
to go over the losses in your head, to think about all the things you could have done differently knowing now what you didn't know then.
I keep trying to figure out what I could have done better, how I could have saved her.
You couldn't.
You're gonna lose people, and it is never gonna feel okay.
But that doesn't mean it's your fault.
It just means that you care.
And there is nothing wrong with that.
Big day. You ready?
Uh, yeah, I guess. Why is it a big day?
Oh, no. Here.
This is you.
That's not the training desk.
Congratulations, graduate.
Today you fly solo.
But...
the shooting call -- You did everything right.
So trust your instincts. Trust yourself.

But maybe I can help. <i> You are nice,</i> <i>but you can't help.</i> <i>I just wanted to make sure everybody understood.</i> <i>This wasn't an accident. I knew what I was doin'.</i> <i>And they all deserved it.</i> Deserved what?
<i>Oh, sorry. I buried the lede.</i> <i>My name is Stanley Whitworth,</i> <i>and I just planted a bomb.</i> They found the guy's house. No sign of him.
They went to his job, and it turns out he was fired last month.
Did they find the bomb?
No. The place was clear.
I guess maybe it was just some kind of revenge prank.
Didn't sound like a prank to me.
I think maybe we have the wrong job.
I was looking at his social media.
You should not be doing that.
This isn't the first time he's lost a job.
Probably half a dozen of them in the last two years.
What was the first job he lost?
Clearing the building now, but we need to shut off gas and power as a precaution.
Eddie, you're on electrical --Buck, I want you to go up the street, shut the gas off at the main.
Copy that.
I mean, I know Stan was angry, but...it's Stan!
He was with us for almost 20 years until the accident.
He was injured on the job.
Blamed the company for cutting corners.
Filed a grievance over it.
The company said it was his mistake.
So when they fired him, he lost his health and pension.
Court threw out his claim on Friday.
He must have snapped.
What'd he do for the company?
He was in charge of demolition on our job sites.
He'd blow things up for you.
Yes.
BP's elevated. It's probably just the stress.
But I'll keep an eye on her until we can transport.
Cap, power's out, but I just got word that a janitor might have had an asthma attack <i>and collapsed in one of the stairwells.</i> Copy that. Sending Chimney your way.
Captain Nash, you're the I. C.?
Yeah. Building is almost clear.
No sign of any explosives yet.
<i>♪</i> Hey, you find asthma guy yet?
Ah, I checked the main stairwell.
No signs of anyone.
All right, maybe the garage underneath.
I'll check it out, clear the rest of the lobby, make sure nobody's in the elevators.
All right, copy.
All right.
Anybody down here?
Sir. Sir. We need to get you outta here.
Somebody said you were having trouble with your asthma.
I'm a paramedic. Got some basics here.

Then the whole building.
I'm gonna take your word for it.
<i>Chimney, come in!</i> I understand you're an expert on this kinda thing.
The best. Had to disguise myself as the frickin' help just to get in here.
After I gave 'em two decades of my life...
<i>Chimney, you copy?
They kicked me to the curb.</i> And now I'm gonna make 'em a pile of rubble on that same curb.
Hey, Chim!
Chim, hey.
You didn't hear? Squad's moving in.
We'll be out in a minute.
Come on, we can carry him -- No, don't, it's okay. Just...
It's all right.
Just make sure everybody else clears out.
Got it.
I'll let the Cap know.
Wait, wait, wait!
Where's your other guy?
He's in there with the bomber.
We all gotta die of something, right?
Looks like you've already picked your preferred method.
Hey, so, uh, so this respiratory distress --asthma?
Or is that why you filed your grievance?
I was born with it.
The accident's how they got rid of me.
They call themselves a family company, but...
that's a buncha crap.
Hey, look, it's getting worse, okay?
I can just -- No, no.
It's over.
The world's gotta know the truth.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I get it.
You're like a ticking time bomb.
If you don't get the truth out, you're just gonna burst.
You don't know nothin' about it.
Wanna bet?
In fact, you got a minute?
I need to get my men in there and get a bead on this guy.
Not until we find out what's happened with my guy.
Did you see anything?
The guy was breathing hard.
I don't think he was faking that.
Yeah, definitely had something in his hand, probably a bomb, or at least a detonator on him.
Why wouldn't Han just run?
I don't know.
He doesn't know?
He has no idea.
No. They kept it from him.
His entire life.
The sister too?
Wow.
And then she goes and tells me.
What'd you even say?
What was I supposed to say, huh?
Hey, is that a dead man's trigger or --?
I just figured he wanted me outta there.
A plunger means he controls it. A dead man's trigger is designed so that -- I'm familiar, Buck.
Okay. My guys got a partial visual with infrared.
He said they're just...sitting there.
Might be talking. Talking him down.
Could be just buying us some time.
What do you think they're talking about?
He never asked about it? Never suspected a thing?
No. He was just a little kid. I mean, there's a big age gap between him and his sister, so...
Ha. You sure you wanna be part of this family?
Well...
Maddie's pretty great.
I'm really looking forward to being a dad.
If I can just make it through this visit.
Hell, if I can just make it through dinner with them.
Wait, wait, wait.
Another family gathering?
Whew. Wow.
That is...
Very explosive. Yes, very.
Copy that.
Company searched their job site.
Discovered 6 pounds of C4 missing.
Well, he knew exactly where to find it.
Maybe Chimney needs to stop talking to him.
Could set him off.
Sorry. Uh, bad choice of words.
You gotta tell him. He deserves to know.
I feel terrible about it.
And I have been dying to tell somebody!
I can help you get it off your chest.
Thanks, Stan.
Hey, listen, it sounds like your chest ain't doing so well.
Just one hit.
It's not a trick.
It'll help you.
Just albuterol.
We all got problems, Stan.
Yours don't give you the right to blow up innocent people.
Or me.
All clear, all clear. We're comin' out.
Thanks for listening to me, Stan.
Is that -- Hey, are you Buck?
Please sit back. That's it.
Uh, yeah, that's me.
Ha ha. So it's true. What's true?
Okay, that O2 must really be kickin' in.
In ya go, Stanley! You're not lyin'.
Not lying about what? Nothin'--gotta go!
Nice to meet you, Buck.
It's about Buck.
What?
The thing you know. The thing that's been killing you for the last few days.
It's about Buck.
I'm sorry. I would love nothing more than to unburden myself to you right now, but I made a promise.
Are you mad?
I'm impressed.
You're growing as a human right before my eyes.
Think it's ever okay to keep a secret from someone you care about?
It depends on what the secret is and why you're keeping it.
They all think they're protecting him.
Like lying to him means the truth can't hurt him.
But you think they're wrong?
I think there's a reason why he feels alone.
He is. He's the only one not in on it.
Also, I'm not in on it. For the record.
Whatever "it" is...
you keep that to yourself.
<i>Yes, I was married to three men at once,</i> and yes, I ransacked Delia's house.
But I didn't kill her.
<i>You sure you wanna talk to me</i> <i>-without a lawyer present?
I am a lawyer.</i> Was. Kansas. It was another life.
Yeah, you've had quite a few of those.
Like a damned cat.
This gun is registered to you.
Or should I say to...
Conchita Terrano?
Also known as you.
<i>I said I didn't kill her!</i> <i>But your gun killed her.</i> The same gun we found in your pantry.
You see the problem here.
I didn't have the gun when she was shot.
She had it.
So how'd she end up with your gun?
<i>She was stealing my mail and using it to blackmail me.</i> We're done, Delia.
I'm not gonna give you any more money.
Melvin's gonna notice soon, and I cannot let that happen.
But he's not gonna notice the gunshot when you fire that thing?
Or my blood all over you when you go home...
after you kill me?
Oh -- And if you broke my gnome, I'm gonna sue you for that too.
Go home, Rita.
Stick to what you're good at -- conning stupid men.
So Delia had your gun on the night she was killed.
How'd you get it back?
<i>Melvin and I were on the porch</i> <i>-when we heard the shot.</i> What was that?
I don't know.
Um...I'm gonna call 9-1-1.
But you didn't call anyone.
Uh, yeah.
I thought Delia shot someone with my gun.
I needed to find out.
<i>Delia kept her place locked,</i> <i>but John and Joe didn't.</i> <i>I looked over the fence, and...</i> <i>she was dead.</i> <i>You know the only thing worse</i> <i>than Delia killing someone with my gun?</i> <i>Delia getting killed by my gun.</i> <i>I knew how that would look. I had to get it back.</i> Not now, Archie.
(gasps, whispers) Seriously?
Hey, Archie! Archie, Archie.
Go get it. Good boy.
Okay. Oh, God.
<i>That's a hell of a story, I'll give you that.</i> <i>You got anything to back it up?</i> Well, there's the dog toy.
I'll have the officers take you back.
<i>Uh, just a second.</i> Could you show me your hands, please?
Thank you.
You believe her story?
It might sound crazy, but I kinda do.
Why'd you ask me about her hands?
Ballistics mentioned that a piece of fingernail got caught in the gun slide.
Rita had all her fingernails.
But our victim didn't.
Delia was holding the gun when it was fired.
Think about it. On the 9-1-1 call, she said...
Okay, fine! If you people aren't gonna handle this, I'll have to do it myself.
<i>So she's had enough.</i> She wants to put the fear of God into her neighbors.
She grabs the gun, but before she can go out into the street, she's confronted by someone.
<i>-She spins around.
Hey!</i> <i>She's startled.
Hey! Stop!</i> <i>She trips over her damn garden gnome.</i> <i>She loses her balance.</i> <i>And then the gun goes off.</i> It's not the craziest story I ever heard.
It's definitely close.
Okay, so the only thing we don't know is who she was yelling at.
Everybody else is accounted for.
They were all at the block party.
Not...everyone.
Ss, ss, ss, ss.
The dog was in her yard. That's who she was shouting at.
I gotta put that in my report.
Don't worry, Archie.
Not a jury in the world is gonna convict.
Well, I'm just glad everybody's okay.
You all seem to have very dangerous jobs.
Not really. I mean, most of the time, it's pretty run of the mill.
Yeah. And Stan wasn't a bad guy.
He just...needed someone to see him.
To understand how much pain he was in.
He probably wasn't gonna blow the place up.
Still seems...very risky.
I mean, from what I hear, Evan has spent quite a lot of time in hospitals.
From what you hear?
'Cause you coulda come.
Seen for yourself.
Evan, I've told you -- You, uh, you're not good with hospitals.
I got it.
I'm not good seeing my children in them.
You don't know! Mom, Mom.
I'm fine.
I'm ready for dessert.
Oh, Howard, where'd you put that box we brought?
Dad, more gifts?
Not exactly.
It's over by the couch. Let me grab it.
I like him, Maddie.
Me too.
You picked a good one this time.
Mom -- What?
It was a compliment, Evan.
Oh, was it?
Ugh!
Your baby box.
I thought you might wanna pass on some of these things to your little girl someday.
Aw!
Oh, this is cool.
I-I didn't know you made these for us.
When do I get mine?
Hey, you're not even a grown up yet.
They're probably still adding stuff to it.
I can't believe you kept all this.
You thought we'd throw it away?
We may not have agreed with all the choices you made, Maddie, but we never gave up hope that you'd come to your senses.
And you did.
You never gave up hope?
Evan, let's not do this.
United front, remember?
You guys didn't even go to her wedding.
Oh.
She was making a terrible mistake.
We told her that.
Yeah, people make mistakes.
Doesn't mean you give up on 'em.
But you did.
She married Doug, and you cut her off.
At the time, we thought it was...for the best.
We didn't know what was going on.
I swear, Maddie.
We didn't know he was hurting you.
Well, you should have.
You shoulda known!
You shoulda known!
You were right there in the same town.
How could you not know? Actually, you know what?
Maybe it does track, 'cause you barely knew what was going on with your own kids when we <i>were</i>under the same roof.
Maybe you never gave up hope...
You sure as hell gave up on her.
You gave up on both of us.
Oh, and, uh, and you wanna know why I'm really in therapy?
It is because I have spent my entire life feeling like a constant disappointment.
And you wanna talk about our jobs?
You think my job is dangerous?
I have <i>walked</i>through <i>fire</i> every single day of my life because of you.
That is why I am in therapy.
Because nothing I ever did was good enough! We tried.
But you always -- You never made it easy on us.
Either one of you.
We were supposed to? We were kids.
Evan, I don't know what you expected us to do!
Love me anyway.
<i>♪</i> I can't.
Oh -- <i>♪</i> Boom.
Tell Mom and Dad how you feel!
It'll be a fresh start! Ah!
Two dinners.
That's all it took, two dinners, and I am 12 years old again, trapped between my sister and my parents.
And now...planning my awkward apology.
What do you have to apologize for?
Did you say anything that wasn't true?
No, but -- Well, look.
Maybe you could've come at it a little differently, but if that's how you feel, how they made you feel, you have every right to say so.
Yeah, I don't need any more therapy.
Tuh! Tuh!
I just wanna hit things.
I've been down that road.
I don't recommend it.
Maddie again?
Yeah.
She's worried about me.
Ah!
Can't imagine why.
Heading out, Sergeant Grant?
Uh, yeah. Been a long couple of days.
Oh, by the way. Congratulations.
We apprehended a corgi, Williams.
I'm not sure anyone's getting a medal for that one.
A dog? What? I was talking about your daughter.
She saved a lotta people yesterday.
You must be proud.
Yeah. I am.
<i>♪</i> <i>May?</i> Hey, Mom, what's up?
Can you come down here? I wanna talk to you.
Surprise! Surprise!
Whoa!
Congratulations!
What-what is this?
A little birdie told me that you finished your training.
Congratulations, baby. I'm proud of you.
You saved like 100 people.
37, but yes, big save.
Now, we didn't have time to order you something custom, so we got you some cupcakes.
Oh, my gosh!
Thank you! Well, don't look at me.
No, Bobby was not the one that told me about your big call.
Mom -- I wish you would've told me yourself.
I mean, you know I'm here whenever you need me, right?
Yes, I do. I just...
I needed to find my way without you.
And you did.
I'm proud of you.
Me too.
<i>Are you okay?</i> Embarrassed, mostly, about the way I went off on Mom and Dad.
You don't have to defend me. I can take care of myself.
Well, you shouldn't have to. Not from your own parents.
But I'm sorry.
I know you're trying to fix things with them.
Not just for me. For you too.
You shouldn't have to carry the weight of their mistakes.
You deserve better than that.
Yeah, well...
And you have never...
you've never been a disappointment.
You know, I-I gotta say, uh...
This was a surprise.
Never knew Mom and Dad were so sentimental.
Yeah, they used to be...different.
Different how?
Happier.
I mean, maybe they weren't.
You take things on differently as a kid.
Ho ho ho, hey! There's a handsome devil.
That's not supposed to be in -- Oh!
No pictures of me allowed in your baby box.
Selfish! Ha.
This doesn't look like our house.
When-when was this taken?
1988?
That can't be right. I wasn't even born yet.
Maddie.
Maddie, who --who is this?
That's Daniel.
He died.
He was our brother.
 @@@@@@
Okay, Evan. This is it.
You ready?
Ready.
You sure you don't wanna go back to training wheels?
Okay.
You're doing great.
Just get a feel for it.
But you're not gonna let go.
I'm not gonna let go.
You let go!
You're doing it, Evan!
I'm doing it!
Whoo!
My God. Turning.
Turning. I forgot turning.
Turn the wheel, Evan, and lean a little!
Turn and lean!
 Watch yourself, kid!
 Yes!
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
You did it! You did it! Keep it coming!
Buckleys for the win!
Buckleys for the...
Evan!
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Shh, shh, shh.
What is going on?
Maddie, what did you do to him?
He's fine.
 You're all right, okay, bud?
 Mommy.
Where did you get that?
I found it in the garage under some junk.
Margaret, I...
No.
 No, honey...
 No.
Hey...
You should've left it where it was.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Take your brother in the house.
He was seven when you were born.
He was gone a year later.
That's why you don't remember him.
How did he die?
Juvenile leukemia.
He got sick right after that photo was taken.
Life changed for ever after that.
Three years of doctors and hospitals, every treatment they could find, but...nothing worked.
I don't understand why no one told me.
I mean, I had a brother.
They were in shock.
After he died.
They packed up his things. We moved to a new town.
They made me promise never to tell you.
No, it doesn't make any sense.
They were grieving.
I think they still are.
So I was born in the middle of all of that.
Of him being sick.
Yeah.
Leukemia.
I'm.
I'm surprised they didn't try a bone marrow transplant.
None of us were a match.
Not Dad, not Mom...not me.
They couldn't find a match.
So they made one.
Me.
You were a match.
But then the cells didn't graft.
Daniel had a relapse.
I wanted to tell you so many times.
But the more time that went by, it just got harder, you know?
And I'm so sorry.
Evan, please don't leave.
Just talk to me.
What were you thinking?
That my brother felt unloved and alone and I didn't want him to think that it was his fault, so I told him.
Well, it wasn't your place.
I'm not a kid anymore. You can't tell me my place.
Watch the way you speak to your mother.
This isn't her fault.
It's not mine either.
You know, it wasn't my decision to pack up my dead brother's things, move to a new town, and pretend like he never existed.
We didn't have a choice!
You don't remember what it was like.
The way people looked at us, talked about us, judged us for having Evan.
And it only got worse after Daniel died.
And your mother was in no state to deal with all of that, so I thought, "Let's move." Fresh start, for everybody.
You're not a mother yet.
You don't understand that kind of loss.
What it does to you.
You disappeared into your grief and left me and Evan to fend for ourselves.
Maddie, that's not fair.
We tried.
Not hard enough.
No.
I don't understand why you kept it.
 We decided...
 I know.
I just wanted one thing to remember him by.
We live with the reminder every day.
 Staring us in the face.
 All right, no...
Isn't that enough for you?
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let me see how bad it is.
They're really mad.
They're not mad.
They're...upset.
They were yelling. A lot.
Sometimes, people do that when they care too much.
They overreact and they feel bad about it later.
You're not in trouble.
Promise?
I promise.
Evan?
Hey.
What do you say we go to the store, get you a new bike?
 Really?
 Yeah.
I'll get my keys.
Hey, maybe we'll grab some ice cream on the way back.
They're really not mad.
Told you.
It's just what happens when they worry.
Yeah.
Evan!
What?
This explains so much about you.
It's a miracle that you even survived childhood.
It's a miracle he survived yesterday.
It was the only way I could get their attention.
Guess now we know why.
They never wanted another kid.
They just had me for parts.
Defective parts, as it turned out.
Hey, that's not on you.
I doubt they would agree.
Have you talked to them about it?
What am I gonna say?
"Hey, I'm really sorry about your dead son, but can we just talk about me for a minute?" Daniel wasn't their only son.
You matter too, Buck.
Sure. Just...just not to them.
Sorry I'm late, Cap.
Hey, can we talk in private?
No need. Come on. They all heard the story.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
 Believe me, I wanted to...
 I get it.
Maddie put you in a tough spot.
She does that.
You need to call her, Buck.
She really wants to talk to you.
So what did you wanna talk about?
Heard you got grounded again.
What'd you do?
I tried out for the football team.
And that got you grounded?
Well, someone had to sign the permission slip.
Guessing it wasn't either of our parents.
Figured they'd just say no.
You know how they are. They suck.
Where are we?
We used to live here.
Really?
I thought we always lived in Hershey.
Guess you wouldn't remember.
You were really little then.
Why'd we move?
Okay, I need to tell you something, and it's gonna sound crazy, but I need you to listen.
Is that him again?
Hold on.
Hey, babe.
Yeah.
I'm with Evan.
No, not yet.
Of course I'll be home for dinner.
Okay, love you too.
Why's he always gotta know what you're doing?
It's sweet.
He cares about me.
I don't like him.
So you were gonna tell me something crazy?
Doug got accepted to medical school.
In Boston.
He asked me to go with him, and I said yes.
I applied to some nursing schools.
I'm gonna go nights so I can work during the day, pay for it myself.
That way. I won't need to ask Mom and Dad for anything ever again.
You're leaving me?
Boston's not that far.
And I'm just a phone call away whenever you need me.
Promise?
Can't get rid of me that easy.
Just wanted to make sure you were okay 'cause you're not answering my calls.
Please just give me a chance to 29 years.
Why is it now suddenly such an emergency?
Because you won't talk to me.
And you're here, working, and you probably shouldn't be.
No, you don't get to take that away from me too.
I wasn't trying...
We were supposed to be a team.
Us versus them. That's what we always said.
But it turns out it was the three of you against me the whole time.
And now, you're not here for me.
You're here to make yourself feel better.
Station 51, fifth alarm.
Industrial complex fire.
2351 East Boulevard.
Okay, five-alarm fire. We're third on the scene.
Captain Mehta from the 133 is IC.
It's his show. You guys know what to do.
Gear up and stand by for a size-up.
Hand sanitizer factory.
32 workers inside. We've accounted for 20.
Sprinkler system's overtaxed, nonfunctional.
We're trying to get the water flowing again.
You can see where the hot zones are.
That could change at any second.
 Accelerants?
 Everywhere.
We have no idea where they're stored.
They didn't file a certificate with the city?
They did when they were a perfume factory.
Converted to sanitizer when the pandemic hit.
The place is packed with flammables, so, basically, it's a minefield in there.
And a large one, so you stay with your teams.
If you need to split off, you remember your hose line is your lifeline.
You get lost, you find a wall.
There are still 12 workers in there unaccounted for.
Eddie and I will be joining the 133, searching on the Charlie side.
Hen, Chim, Buck, you will be running a team with two firefighters from the 141.
Your entry point is the alpha side.
Let's go!
 Copy that, Cap!
 Copy that.
Hey, Buck.
Not now, Chim.
You know you can't run away from this forever, right?
Sure I can. It's the Buckley family way.
It's gonna be so weird without you.
Do Mom and Dad know yet?
Maddie, we need to talk.
Doug called.
 He told us about Boston.
 God.
She's going to nursing school. You should congratulate her.
Don't be stupid, Evan. This is not good news.
 Don't talk to him like that.
 Evan?
Why would you agree to go with him?
Because I love him and he loves me.
I need to tell you something.
I'm leaving, Evan.
Coming through! Coming through!
Whoa, watch out!
Knock it down, boys!
To the left.
IC, this is Buckley, 118.
I got level four flammables inside the west side entry.
Looks like about ten pressurized drums.
Copy that, Buckley.
Sprinkler systems are still down, so I'm sending in foam.
All right, guys, let me know the level of involvement up ahead.
The victims are toward that side of the building.
Copy that.
I wouldn't say all clear, but definitely clear enough for us to keep on moving.
This way's no good.
Great. Let's keep going.
Wait, wait, here.
Someone put towels under this door to keep the smoke out.
Hey, I got people inside!
Go, go, go, go!
Scott, Lorenzo, let's go!
Try to remain calm.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
IC, Captain Nash here.
Be advised we have located seven victims, but we've had some accelerants ignite up here.
We are separated from two of our team.
Sending them back out.
You guys hear that? They need help.
That's clear across the factory!
They lost two guys! We got plenty here.
I should go.
You're not wrong, Buck.
And I don't say that to you very often.
Go!
Be careful!
 Maddie...
 Omar, did you give colitis guy Ibuprofen?
Because that could trigger symptoms...
Hang on. There's some kid in Exam 3.
He insists on seeing you.
Says you pinky sweared.
I don't know what that is, but he won't leave.
Maddie, you've gotta help me.
Evan, what happened?
I crashed my bike.
 You what?
 No, I'm all right.
They patched me up at Presbyterian, but I needed to see you, like, right away.
Omar, this is my brother, Evan.
Yeah. The football star.
Yeah, hey.
Let me know if you need anything.
Maybe a sedative.
Are you okay? No concussion?
Look, I can't go home.
What are you talking about?
I got kicked out of school.
Again?
Wait, how do you even get kicked out of community college?
Maybe you use your tuition money to make some cool modifications on your bike.
Evan...
There were also some keg parties that I bankrolled.
Do they know about this?
No.
No, not yet, but if I go home like this, they're gonna find out a lot faster.
What do you want me to do?
Can't I just stay with you?
I mean, I've hardly seen you since you and Doug moved back, and you got that nice big house, you know, maybe with a nice big guest room?
It's Doug, isn't it? He hates me.
No, no, no. He doesn't.
He does not hate you.
It's just things are complicated at home.
Well, try my home.
It's got so much worsened since you've left, all right.
Mom and Dad think I'm a total loser, and I'm not, Maddie. I'm not, okay?
I'm gonna be something.
I just...I don't know what it is yet.
Hey, of course you will.
The way they look at me through me.
I can't live with that anymore.
Look, we're gonna figure something out, okay?
I promise.
IC, be advised.
That last explosion took out most of the supports in here.
Structural integrity is not good.
All teams, all teams, be advised.
We are evacuating the structure.
Repeat, full evacuation is in effect.
IC, this is Buckley.
One team found seven victims.
Others got four.
Means there's still someone in here.
Yeah, we are aware, Buckley.
But it's too unstable.
We're just gonna leave someone behind?
It's too dangerous to continue.
You need to pull out, now.
Copy you.
On the move.
Evacuate the building now!
That's an order!
You're reckless.
You do dangerous things without giving them a second thought.
You think you're indestructible, but you're not!
People die!
 Children die!
 Margaret...
What is that supposed to mean?
It means that the world is an uncertain place, Evan, and you have to protect yourself.
We can't do it for you.
What were you even doing in that part of town?
Why weren't you in class?
I...
 Evan?
 Where are you going?
Maddie!
The timing was kinda awesome, actually.
They were just asking me about...college.
Get out.
What is this?
Ooh.
Freedom.
Your way out of here. Away from them.
Wait, you...You're giving me the Jeep?
Are you serious?
Does Doug know?
Look, I can give you a little bit of money to get started, and then you can go anywhere you want.
I mean, this is amazing, but where am I gonna go?
It doesn't matter.
The point is to go as far away as you can, and be happy.
'Cause that's what you did?
 Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
 Come on, Maddie.
You don't have to pretend with me, all right?
I know things aren't okay with Doug.
It's like I said. It's just complicated.
You know, most marriages are.
Hey, what if you came with me?
No more Mom and Dad. No more Doug.
Just you and me against the world.
You and me in the world.
Mom would love it if I left him.
It would be I-told-you-so's until the day she died.
That's not a reason to stay miserable.
 But where would we even go?
 Doesn't matter.
The point is to go.
I did just say that, didn't I?
 What would I tell Doug?
 Don't tell him anything.
You just leave him a note.
He works the rest out when you don't come home.
Yes.
Yes?
Yes.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Anyone in here?
Hey, hey! Hey, I can hear you!
Keep making those noises.
I'm on my way.
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, are you hurt?
I am lost. Too much smoke.
It's okay. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you breathe?
This is helping.
The fire is not.
Then let's make it quick. Come on.
Stay low.
Over here. Come on.
All right, back this way.
Through here. Come on.
I believe we are both lost now.
Evan, Evan.
Hey. Maddie's friend, right?
Hey, have you seen her?
I was supposed to pick her up here, but I can't find her and she's not answering her phone.
Yeah, she left this for you.
Dear Evan, I'm sorry to tell you this way, but I can't leave with you.
For one crazy minute, I really thought I could do it.
But then reality set in and I realized that my life is here.
But yours isn't.
It's still ahead of you, and I want you to find it.
Find the thing that makes you happy.
The people that make you feel loved.
This is your time now, Evan.
Go find your place in the world and never look back.
There. I think I see an exterior wall.
Let us hope it is equipped with a door.
Hey, what's your name?
 Saleh.
 Saleh.
I think we're gonna have to walk across this gantry.
You think you can make it?
I would like nothing more than to make it.
Same here. Let's do it.
Move, move, move!
Hang on!
Maddie.
Mailroom just sent this up.
It's from your brother.
Dear Maddie, bet you're surprised to hear from me.
I'm done being mad at you. Mostly.
Been bouncing up and down the East Coast for a few months now picking up some odd jobs.
Haven't found my place yet, but I've met some cool people.
Though no one as cool as you. I miss you.
P. S. I'm sending these to the hospital 'cause I don't trust Doug not to toss them in the trash.
Have you left him yet?
I finished school! Bartending school.
I'm the coolest mixologist in Virginia Beach.
I met this girl who likes to surf and I started learning.
I really like the ocean.
Maybe it's 'cause I never got to see it as a kid.
When I'm out there, it just feels like there's nothing but possibility.
There's no stopping me now.
Nick Drake's "One of These Things First".
I stopped bartending. And surfing.
That thing with the girl seriously did not work out.
I'm doing construction now, working with these guys who frame houses all over.
Guess it's kinda fun.
Just me and the Jeep going wherever the work takes us.
The Jeep took me all the way across the country.
When I got to California, decided I'm gonna try and become a Navy SEAL.
You don't have to fully enlist, and we know how much I like the ocean.
I think Mom and Dad would be proud.
I mean, these are the guys that got Bin Laden.
The baddest of badasses, right?
Hooyah.
He quit the SEALs.
Are you supposed to be reading those?
I'm living vicariously.
And he sent another pic.
Is he gonna be an Indian next, because I feel like he's working his way through the Village People.
My God.
I quit the SEALs.
They wanted robots with red eyes, and that ain't me.
I'm working on this dude ranch, and it is serious.
Big Sky country's beautiful too, but I gotta say, I do miss the ocean.
I made it back to the ocean.
It's gonna be too cold here soon, though, so I'm thinking of checking out Peru.
Why Peru?
One of my old ranch hand buddies tends bar down there now.
I'm gonna be a mixologist again.
Funny how life comes full circle.
Full circle.
More like going in circles.
Speaking Spanish...
Yo, bartender!
Otra cerveza, por favor.
Coming right up.
Dude, we were just talking about you.
Hershey, PA? That is so cool.
That's, like, where chocolate was invented, man.
Actually, it was invented down here.
It was the Olmecs in ancient Mexico...okay.
Here you go, man. Enjoy.
Yo, you should come to LA with us, bruh.
We got this bitching craftsman in Arcadia.
You'd fit right in.
Ocean's only an hour away.
You guys all live together?
Yeah. Kind of a family.
"You go, we go." Like the movie?
So tell me about LA.
Saleh!
Thank you for attempting to save me.
It appears this vat had a different plan.
It is also very heavy.
I'm gonna need you to try and stay calm, okay?
I'm gonna get this thing off you.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You will need to hurry.
Let's get 02 on these people and get a wide open line of fluids.
 Watch your step.
 Head over there.
Where's Buck?
Could ask you the same question.
He split off when you lost two of your guys.
IC, this is Buckley, 118.
Buckley, did you ignore my direct order to evacuate?
 He does that sometimes.
 I got the last victim.
But this sanitizer has ignited all around me.
I wanna say I'm near the northeast corner Delta wall, but I'm not sure.
Sure could use some sprinkler action.
They online yet?
Negative. We got you.
Hang tight. We're gonna get you both out.
Rick team, Rick team, deploy.
Delta entrance, repeat, Delta entrance, northeast corner.
Rescue team's coming to you, Buckley.
Copy you. Not going anywhere.
Dear Maddie, hope you're still getting these.
California is amazing.
I think you'd like it here.
It's a hard place to feel sad.
Maybe it's all the sunshine.
Today is my first day as a probationary firefighter.
That's right. I made it through.
Wish me luck.
P. S. There were three other Evans in my class, so everyone calls me Buck now.
I kinda like it.
 Cap.
 Yup.
Hi. Evan Buckley, new recruit?
I was told to report to Captain Nash.
You know a Captain Nash?
You? You?
Um...
Take a seat, Evan.
Buck. Everyone just calls me Buck.
Welcome to the 118, Buck.
Thank you.
This is amazing.
Is it always like this?
Always.
Well, when Bobby's in the captain's chair, anyways.
Then I might be in the right place.
You okay?
This is a relative term. But I am all right.
What are you looking for?
I was a fire marshal once.
This is a factory.
They're required to have fire extinguishers three feet off the ground.
Okay, I think I got one, Sa...
Saleh?
Here you go. Just breathe.
Just breathe.
But how will you breathe?
I'm gonna hold it.
For how long?
As long as I can.
Okay.
I got it!
Saleh.
Hey, come on.
Come on. Hey.
Breathe. Breathe.
You okay?
I got lost, Bobby.
I went off on my own, and two seconds later, I didn't know where the hell I was standing.
Buck, that place is a maze.
And no one was surprised that you stayed in there, Buck.
I almost gave up.
If you guys hadn't come in, then...
But we did.
And we always will.
They said it was a big one.
They weren't kidding.
Firefighter Buckley here pulled out the very last victim.
Of course he did.
Yeah, then everyone else had to pull me out.
Well, I'm sure whoever you saved is just glad you were being Buck.
I don't even know what that means.
You never give up.
That's what being Buck means to me.
But whatever you do, don't stop.
Clean bill of health from the docs.
Glad to hear it.
Show-off.
I had to do it.
I know you did.
You got some visitors.
Hi.
Hope you weren't waiting long.
The other firefighters were very kind.
We got to hear a lot of stories about you.
They seem to like you a great deal.
Yeah, I.
I like them too.
I don't even know where to start.
I'm sorry.
About Daniel.
I can't imagine what that must have felt like to not be able to save someone you love.
Evan...
Buck.
Buck.
That is...that's what people who know me...
That's what they call me.
Okay. Buck.
You have to know, we never blamed you.
None of this was your fault.
I still wish I could've done more.
Buck you were born to save someone.
And that's what you do.
Every day. We are so proud of you.
Did that go okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Is it gonna be okay with Maddie?
Chim, I can't...
You're totally allowed to be mad at her.
But if you can find a way to forgive them, you've gotta find a way to forgive her.
She should've told me.
She didn't want you to think that you weren't wanted.
That you weren't loved.
You know what? I wasn't.
Yes, you were. By her.
She sent me away, Chim.
I needed her, and she wasn't there.
She just handed me keys to a car, sent me on my way so that I didn't mess up her life.
The Jeep?
That's what you're talking about?
Of course you know about that.
More than you, apparently.
Dear Evan, I'm sorry to tell you this way, but I can't leave with you.
For one crazy minute, I really thought I could do it.
But then reality set in and I realized that my life is here.
You should've gone with him.
I think Doug made it pretty clear what would happen if I left.
 Maybe your brother could help.
 No.
Evan should never know.
Hi. Did you.
I'm gonna give you guys a minute.
So Mom and Dad came to the firehouse.
Wanted me to forgive them.
I did.
Wow.
That must have been difficult.
The thing is, not really.
'Cause it's hard to feel betrayed by someone that you didn't really think you could count on anyway.
And easy to lash out on the person that you know is always gonna forgive you.
I know that I hurt you.
And if I could take it back...
But I keep thinking about that.
What life would be like if I would've known.
Would I still be me?
I'm pretty sure you would always be Buck.
Would you would you tell me about Daniel?

Well, is it actually a curse?
I know we called it that, but technically, I think it's a jinx.

Hello, everyone.
Sorry I'm late. Are we ready to see Mommy?
Are you ready for your visit? No. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
It's okay, baby.
It'll just be a little while and we'll be here waiting for you when you're done.
I'm sorry.
But we should talk about scheduling some overnight visits for Nia and her mother.
Yes. We need to talk.
We want to meet her.
We want to meet Nia's birth mother.
Ms. Wilson, you know we can't do that.
Why not?
We need to make sure Nia's safe, right?
Mm-hmm.
That's the job you gave us...
Mm-hmm.
...as foster parents.
I-I want to do my job.
It's the state's job, and this is about reunification.
These last few visits were about rebuilding a bond and a trust between Nia and her biological mother.
Well, isn't there anything you can tell us about her?
Nothing beyond the fact that she's demonstrated her ability to give Nia a safe and stable home.
Demonstrate how?
We-we don't even know what she did wrong in the first place.
What-what, was it, was it drugs?
Was she abusive? Neglectful? What?
Look, it is not uncommon for foster parents to feel this way.
I mean, Nia has been with you a long time.
Longer than we expected.
And the pandemic made it longer.
What are our options?
For?
For protecting Nia.
Our legal options.
Can we adopt her?
Let me just stop you right here.
You've done a-an amazing job with Nia.
I wish I had a dozen more foster families like you.
But the reunification of a child and their birth parent is our main goal.
What if that birth parent is still unfit?
You have to trust us. We wouldn't have started this process if we thought her mother wasn't ready.
And even after she regains physical custody, we don't just walk away.
There'll be follow-up visits, check-ins.
We will make sure she's safe.
Come back inside when you're ready.
And Carly will bring Nia out after her visit.
And today, she goes home with you.
Hen? You need to calm down.
T-They're tearing our family apart, Karen.
H-How can I stay calm? How can you be calm?
Because this is the job.
It's what we signed up for.
We knew, we...
I didn't know it would, it would feel like this.
We were supposed to foster her for-for a few months.
It's been almost a year, Karen. She's our daughter now.
I know.
I know this is hard...
No, it's not hard.
It's wrong.
What the hell?
Oh! Oh, oh, my gosh.
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't, I didn't see you there.
I'd say we need a traffic light there, but I'm pretty sure you'd have barreled through that, too.
Hey. Are you okay?
Um, yeah. I guess.
I just got this friend request from someone I used to go to high school with.
Just kind of caught me by surprise.
Ah, a whole seven months ago.
How the time flies.
She transferred out a few years back.
After bullying me and making my life a living hell.
You want me to respond to her?
I'm sure I could think of a few choice ideas of where she can stick her friend request.
Hey, it-it's okay.
Just...I think I'm gonna ignore it.
You know, it's-it's been three years.
Doesn't really matter what she has to say anymore.
Attagirl.
You sure you should be working nights when you're that pregnant?
Oh, I figured staying up all night would be good practice for all the hours I'm gonna be keeping when the baby's born.
Well, you make me feel like I should be calling OSHA to report a labor violation.
Ooh. Don't say that word.
Whoa, are you having contractions?
Constantly.
But not real ones.
Braxton Hicks. I've been having them all week, and every time I think something's gonna happen...
nothing.

Yeah, you might want to "D" that a little faster.
When my mother went to the hospital to have my little brother, she didn't have a name picked out, either.
Then she got all caught up in the emotion, named him after the nice doctor.
And my brother has been living his entire life regretting it.
Oh, my God. What did she name him?
Norman.
Isn't your last name...?

Hey, anybody got any suggestions for baby names?
Not any of your names.
Uh, I thought you were just gonna put names in a hat.
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.

Maddie still having false labor?
I know kids are supposed to test your patience, but I thought she'd at least wait until she was out of the womb.
Well, at least, you'll be well-prepared for her arrival.
Oh, we are.
Baby toys, clothes, towels, blankets, supplements.
Freeze-dried rations.
Rations?
What, do you hate hospital food that much?
Hey, Wilson!
Could use a hand here.
No, in case the hospital loses power.
Ah.
Didn't we just restock the ambulance?
Well, yeah, but there's no such thing as being too prepared, right?

His name is Jacob.
CHP, please note, there is a child in the vehicle.

Copy that, 727.
All right, lift on three.
One, two, three.
Make sure everybody stays back until the cars have been de-energized and all the airbags have been checked.
What's the count, Captain?
Well, three casualties so far, at least a dozen injured.
Dispatch, send another ten R. A. units here ASAP.
Oh. All this because of one driver.
I take it this is the offending vehicle?
What's left of it. We're still working on getting in there.
You sure there's anyone in there left to save?
No verbal response. Can't see past the side airbags.
But we picked up a heat signature.
Definitely a live occupant in the front.
Smaller heat signature in the back.
Dispatch says they got a call from the driver's son, Jacob.
The kid's still in the car?
Go! Go! Jaws.
Check! One, two, three.
Buck, get in there.

Eddie, get me a neck brace.
Pulse is steady. Multiple lacerations.
Airbag burn.
What ha-happened?
You think her slurred speech is a symptom of her injuries?
Can't be too sure yet.
Dispatch says she was acting odd before the crash, too.
Chim, how's that kid looking?
Upper vertebra seems intact, but his systolic blood pressure is skyrocketing -- could be a TBI.
Probably best to transport him in the seat.
All right, make it safe and get him out.
Copy that. All right.
Dispatch, contact the Children's Hospital ER.
Have them prep for neurosurgery.
We've got a patient, Jacob, approximately seven to eight years old, coming in with a possible TBI.
Jacob?
Uh, Jacob is still in the back seat.
We're working on getting him out.
Ma'am, were you experiencing any pain, disorientation that may have led to your confusion?
I think I got something...that added to her confusion.
How many people have to die tonight because she was drunk and stupid?
Details to add to my report.

Okay...that one was less than five minutes.
Yeah, you still think you got another hour in you?
Eh.
Okay, here are your things.
My car's downstairs and you are getting in it.
Okay, what about Chim?
Well, he's got a police escort.
He'll meet you there.
It just feels like it's going so fast.
You're nine and a half months pregnant.
It's not that fast.
Oh...!
Oh, God.
Okay, wish me luck.
Good luck.
Word of advice? If she tells you to shut up, shut up.
Copy that.
No, no, no, no. I-I don't understand.
What do you mean I can't see her?
She's here, right?
Yes, your wife is here, but as I explained already, her room is currently listed as secured.
Secured?
What does that even mean?
Everything okay here?
Uh, this gentleman is here to see Rachel Hawkerson.
She's my wife. I got a call that she and my son were in some kind of accident, but nobody will tell me anything, except that my son is at a different hospital and I can't see my wife.
Sir, they were part of the collision on the 710 freeway.
The-the big pileup?
Yes.
Can we go somewhere quiet where we can talk?
I want to see my wife.
I'm afraid you can't do that right now.
Your wife's room is secure because she's in our custody while we investigate the cause of tonight's accident.
The cau...
Right.
On the news, they said it was a drunk driver.
Yes.
No.
No.
She wouldn't do that.
Not with Jacob in the car.
She promised me.
Sometimes, we break our promises.
Okay.
Yes. Uh, thank you.
How's your son?
He's still in surgery.
I, uh...
I need to get over there.
I can have an officer take you.
Did she say anything?
Rachel? At the scene?
She wasn't really coherent.
You didn't know she was drinking?
I thought all this was behind us.
She tried so many times to stay sober.
It almost broke our marriage.
But then...
then Jacob.
And I thought...
I thought, "Finally, she'll have a reason not to drink." I don't know what I'm gonna tell him.
Is there...Is there any way you're wrong about this?
She had a BAC of .28 when she arrived.
Four times the legal limit.
Probably higher at the time of the crash.
That would account for her disorientation from your son's 911 call.
Jacob's the one who called 911?
My poor boy.
You didn't know.
I should have.
I'm here! I'm here. I didn't miss it, did I? Any longer, you might have.
You're fully effaced and at ten centimeters.
We're ready to rock. We're gonna grab a few things, and we'll get started.
Are you okay? Can I do anything for you?
I can shut up. I mean, I can try.
No, no, you're fine.
You know what I need is my breathing beads.
They're in the baby bag. Where is that?
They're not here. I left them in Albert's car.
Ugh!
You know what?
I can call him real fast. Maybe he can run it back over here. Come on, come on, come on.
<i>Hello. This is Albert Han.</i> <i>Please do not leave a message.</i> That's what texts are for.
Straight to voice mail.
He's probably sleeping. I'm so sorry.
You okay?
Hi.
CHIMNEY You're okay.
Extend your arms, please.
All set.
Thank you.
Okay, guys.
It's go time.
First responders are on scene and working.
You should be able to see them.
I don't see anyone.
<i>Are you injured?</i> Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.

It's 7:00 in the morning, Jamal.
There is that place on Ninth.
Bottomless mimosas. Yes.
I'm in. Uh, what about you, May?
Oh, sorry, guys.
Uh, even if they did serve me, I'd just fall asleep in my breakfast.
May, thought you would like to know.
Just got word from the hospital.
Albert Han arrived alive, and his condition is stable.
Oh, thank God.
I mean, could you imagine? Today of all days.
Well, luckily, we don't have to.
Go get some rest.
Thanks, Sue. Good night. Morning. Whatever.
Hey, Buck. It's good to see you.
The hospital has a strict no visitor policy right now.
I-I know. Hey, Chimney...
The girls are both doing great.
Maddie was a warrior in there.
Oh, hey, where'd you get that?
Is Albert here?
Oh, hey. Good morning.
The kids are still brushing their teeth, but pancakes should be done in five.
You packed her bag?
Yeah. Overnight visit, remember?
Social worker will be by this afternoon.
No, no, not tonight.
Ton -- I need to sleep tonight and-and know that she's safe.
Hen......we can't stop this.
How could you just stand there?
What?
Nia. Nia's...
damn near crying her eyes out, and you just write it off like it happens every day.
And the social worker tells us there's nothing we could do, and you just stand there.
Why don't you want to fight this, Karen?
You think I don't want to?
It doesn't seem like it.
It seems like you've already accepted it.
Y-You're making pancakes, you're packing bags.
Wh-What are you doing?
Don't you dare.
Tell me why you don't want to fight this!
Because there is no fight.
She has a mother.
She's not ours, even if we love her like she is.
You want to know what I'm doing?
I'm holding on.
That is all I am doing, holding on.
Please don't make me do it alone.
Come on.
Hey! Guess who's here!
Mama Hen!
I mean, I've been at a lot of deliveries before, but...this one really did seem kind of miraculous.
I guess all dads feel that way.
I am a dad.
How crazy is that?
I can't wait for you to meet her.
Still doesn't have a name though.
I don't suppose you have any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm kind of stumped, too.
What about Alberta?
Or...Albertina?
I thought for sure I'd get a response on that one.
Listen...
I know you're tired and you've had a really crappy day, but...I kind of need you to wake up here and tell me you're okay, 'cause your doctors are giving me some real serious looks and expressing their concerns.
But they don't know us Hans.
We are excellent healers.
So you're gonna be all right, 'cause you're my brother.
And I don't know when that went from being a biological fact to an emotional reality for me, but...
there's no turning back now.
You know, I finally have everything I ever wanted.
A family of my own.
Maddie.
The baby.
And you.
Yep. Today could be the best day of my life.
'Cause I have my beautiful baby girl...and my brother didn't die.
In fact, he woke up and he told me he was gonna be okay.
So you just open your eyes, Albert.
Please.
It hurts.
It's okay.
Hey.
We got plenty of time, little brother.
Heard about Albert.
Is he okay?
He's alive.
What about that boy from the crash? Jacob?
Surgery was a success.
He's stable and recovering with his father.
That's good.
Mother got lucky.
Minor scrapes and bruises.
Husband says he had no idea that she had started drinking again.
Not sure if I believe him.
Well, could be true.
Could be he just needed to believe it was true.
I'm sorry about what I said at the wreck.
"Drunk and stupid" thing.
You weren't wrong.
People died last night because of her.
I don't know her, but I know what it's like to inflict that kind of damage.
Bobby, you are nothing like that woman.
I am exactly like that woman.
The day I forget that, that will be a very dangerous day.
I got to go out for a while.
I love you.
Love you, too.
<i>am standing here in this roomI</i> for the same reason as a lot of you.
Because I am selfish as hell.
Also, I'm an alcoholic.
And, for a long time, I thought that I was strong enough to balance those two things.
To live life on my terms.
But I've got news for you.
Life doesn't care how strong you think you are.

What was that about?
Hello, Baby Girl Han.
You were right. We should have picked a name sooner.
I can't believe they discharged you without something for the birth certificate.
I picked a name.
I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I had to give them something.
I'm not sure if I'm mad or relieved.
Pressure's off.
It's not something I'm gonna hate, is it?
It's Jee-Yun.
That's my mother's name.
I called Mrs. Lee to tell her about the baby and Albert.
And she just kept saying, "I wish his mother was here to see her." And that's when I knew what her name was.
Jee-Yun Buckley Han.
It's pretty good, right?
It's beautiful.
I'm really glad that Albert's okay.
Yeah, me, too.
God, talk about bad luck.
No.
I'm starting to think we're just the luckiest people ever.
Yeah.
Hi, Jee-Yun. Hi.
 @@@@@@
All you got to do is hang on.
Push through the pain.
"911," all-new Mondays.
And watch other Fox shows like "Lone Star," "Prodigal Son," and "The Resident" on Fox.
Hey there, all my Successful Super Moms.
This is Beth Reidman coming to you live from my son Bryson's 12th birthday party!
I am gonna show you how a Successful Super Mom -- or Dad -- throws a birthday bash.
Oh, and there's the birthday boy right now.
How are you enjoying the party?
Oops. Technical difficulties.
Or maybe you could be a normal mom and not go live on the Gram.
And disappoint my sponsors who were generous enough to give us all this stuff for free, by the way?
But it's so lame.
I can't believe you made me wear this.
Why couldn't we just do paintball or laser tag, like I wanted? This stuff is for babies.
Too violent. Those games are like simulated war -- I can't put that on my blog.
Oh, so this party is for you?
To give you content for your blog?
My blog and all the sponsored content is what pays the bills around here.
You're embarrassing me in front of my friends.
What are you talking about?
Everyone is having a great time.
The trampoline is a hit.
Everything here is for babies.
I'm 12, Mom.
So I guess that means you don't want to play pin the tail on the donkey?
Pin the tail on the donkey?
I think I liked it better when you had a real job.
What do I have to do to prove to her I'm not a kid anymore, pay taxes?
And now for a party favorite, pin the tail on the donkey!
This game is a classic that is guaranteed to keep the kids having fun.
We're not eight years old.
Come on, guys, try it.
It's fun!
Mm, nah.
Okay. I guess I'll go first.
Your mom's really into this party.
It's kind of weird.
Shut up.
I hate...
this stupid...party!
Mom!
I was jumping on the trampoline, and a spring flew off.
Okay.
And it almost killed me.
All right, let's see what we got.
Looks like she's pinned to the wall in two places.
All right. Let's go, let's go.
Ma'am, don't move.
Any movement could cause that spring to shift, and that would not be good.
Must've been traveling at top speed.
Put a hole right through her hand.
And her torso. Ow.
Is she gonna be okay?
Give us some space.
We're gonna take real good care of your mom, I promise.
Can you move your fingers?
I think so.
Good. Means the spring likely missed the tendon.
No nerve damage.
Oh, thank God. It's my selfie hand.
Pulse is slightly elevated, but BP's normal.
Miraculously, she's stable.
Getting bilateral breath sounds.
Spring likely didn't puncture her lungs, but it's probably millimeters away from her spine.
I can pack the wound, but I don't know how to detach her from the barn.
We don't. Transport her with it, donkey and all.
Where's Buck?
This is a circular saw.
This blade is strong enough to cut through anything.
Cool.
Even metal.
I'll bet it could slice through bone, too.
Uh, yeah, we don't...
Buck! We need that saw.
I gotta go. Sorry.
You went really hard-core with this party design.
It's my job.
Literally. I run a mommy blog. I spent months planning this thing, trying to make it perfect, and my kid hates me for it.
He doesn't hate you. He's just 12.
He'll get over it.
Feels like no matter what I do, it's wrong.
You did a great job constructing the shed.
Really quality work.
It was from a kit.
I didn't even pick it out.
A sponsor sent it.
Well, at least you have help taking it down.
Almost there.
Last one, Cap.
Okay, so, phase one was a success, but there's no way we get her in this door in the ambulance.
We got to call for a flatbed.
We got a penetrating trauma.
I don't think we can wait.
Got any other options?
Easy, guys, easy.
Watch the springs.
Easy.
Good work.
Oh, Mom!
I got your phone!
Thank you, sweetie.
I'm sorry I treated you like a little kid. You were right.
I'm just gonna go back to my soul-sucking job.
But, Mom, I don't think you should give up the blog.
Look.
Oh, my God. I was live the whole time?
Look. You're trending. You're gonna be Internet-famous.
We're gonna be rich!
Oh! I am monetizing parenthood!
Ow!
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i> What are you doing up?
Can I sleep with you and Mama?
Well, of course.
Get on up in here.
You have a bad dream?
No.
Mm, you just want to cuddle, that's it.
You okay?
You're worried about tomorrow.
About Nia leaving.
I don't want her to go away.
I know I get mad at her sometimes.
I just don't want her to leave.
Neither do we.
It's like we talked about.
Nia came to live with us, because her real mom couldn't take care of her.
But now her mom is better, so Nia gets to go home to her.
Now, that's gonna hurt for us, but it'll be good for Nia.
You're not my real moms.
Are you gonna have to give me back, too?
Denny, we are your real moms.
We're your mothers in every way that matters.
And no one is ever taking you away from us.
We even have a piece of paper from a judge that says so.
Did my real...
Did my <i>other</i> mom not want me?
Sweetie, she was sick, and she wasn't in a place where she could take care of you.
And it was a hard decision, but she wanted the best for you.
And that's why she gave you to us.
So we could love and protect you and be your moms forever.
So, nobody's gonna come and take me away?
Not ever.
I promise.
<i>Here.</i> I didn't like it when you took it off my bed, but I want you to have it so you can remember me.
And don't forget him. I know he's your favorite.
You play later with me?
I don't think I can.
Oh.
You're going home to your mommy today, remember?
Denny come with me?
Not this time.
Why don't you say goodbye?
Oh, that's a good hug.
I'm gonna miss those.
Hey. You know, we, uh...
we never gave this...
this guy a name.
What are you gonna call him?
Denny!
For...for big brother.
That's great. That's great.
He'll look after you, just like a big brother.
We love you, Nia.
Always remember that.
I love you, too, Mama Hen.
You ready, Nia?
Ready.
See you later. No.
Sweetie.
No, we will...we will see you later.
We love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, Denny, why don't you head into the kitchen?
I think your grandma's making you a special lunch.
Okay.
KAREN When we, uh...
When we took her in, we weren't thinking about the day we'd have to give her back.
Yeah.
That it would be this hard.
I know. I've been doing this a long time.
And it's never easy.
It's not for everyone. A lot of folks never go back for a second placement.
Yeah. I guess that's something we have to think about and discuss.
There's nothing to discuss.
I never want to do this again.
You're gonna be late if you keep watching her.
You sure you're gonna be okay on your own? I hate to leave you guys.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Whoa. What the...?
I'll go. You stay here.
Albert, what happened?
Yeah.
I was trying to get something off the shelf.
I lost my balance.
Why didn't you ask for me or Maddie?
You already have a baby to take care of. You don't need two.
What we don't need is you hurting yourself because you're too stubborn to ask for help.
I should be better. The accident was weeks ago.
The doctor said there would be lingering issues, balance being one of them.
You just got to be patient.
And quit trying to do stuff on your own. Let us help.
Are you going out?
Yeah, first day back to work.
We talked about that, remember?
Maybe. Still feels like my brain's in a fog sometimes.
I got to go. Listen, Maddie will be here with you.
If you need something, ask.
Please.
Maybe I could make her breakfast, help her for a change.
And it would be good practice.
Does Maddie like waffles?
Let's not overdo it, okay?
Just get some rest, Albert.
Don't worry about breakfast.
Feels like all I do is rest.
Is he okay?
Little mishap with a shelf.
I'll deal with it when I get home.
You look really handsome for your first day back.
Sexy, too.
Ah.
Well, you're gonna have to hold that thought.
There's nothing we can do about it while we're out here sleeping on an air mattress.
Yeah. I love you. Have a great first day.
Love you, too. And text me if she does anything cute.
Oh, okay. So, like, every other minute?
Exactly.
That's the first time she smiled.
Sure that's a smile? That's the same face Buck makes when he's gassy.
I will take that as a compliment, 'cause it just means she looks like her Uncle Buck.
God, I love her so much. I don't even feel like the same person anymore. Is that weird?
What's that saying? Having a kid is like walking around with your heart outside your body.
Okay, that's weirder. And morbid.
Just means it's a whole different kind of love.
How's Maddie doing? First solo shift with the baby.
Babies. Plural. She's pulling double duty. Albert and Jee-Yun.
Offer still stands, you know. He can come back to my place.
He needs round-the-clock care.
He can't be on his own for a whole 24 hours.
With the new schedule, one of us is always home.
If you and Maddie are working opposite schedules, when do you actually see each other?
Haven't quite figured that out yet.
Oh, uh, she-she's coming.
So, uh, yeah. The doctor said Albert's physical therapy is going great.
HEN Welcome back!
Hey! I was just filling them in on Albert's recovery.
I am disappointed in you guys.
Where's the banner? Where's the balloons?
This is not how we do when somebody comes back to work.
I said it was okay. I don't need that kind of stuff.
Not when, uh...
No, no, no, no. We celebrate every good moment. When we can.
Now, let me see these baby pictures.
Okay.
Oh, my God, she's so big already.
Yeah. They grow up fast.
Aw.
♪ <i>Ah, yeah</i> ♪ Ow. Ow.
Ow.
Oh!
Crap.
Please, you have to send help. I can't move.
What's your name and location, sir?
2016 Irvine Street.
And your name?
I don't see why that matters.
Please, <i>just send someone, quietly.</i> Why are you whispering?
<i>Yes, we heard a crash outside.</i> Where are you right now?
Can you see if the intruder is armed?
<i>I'm in the bedroom.</i> I don't know, uh, I don't know if he's armed.
Tell them to send the police, Trish.
I am. Uh, can you please send the police? We're at <i>2016 Irvine Street.</i> Ma'am, i-is there anyone else in your home that might have also called 911?
No, it's just-just me and my husband.
<i>Why?</i> Josh, why are you sending police units to my broken leg?
Homeowners called and said there was a burglar outside.
That must be your guy.
My broken leg was breaking in?
Yeah.
Sir, uh, the address you gave me -- is this your residence?
CONNOR Yes.
Yes.
<i>At least it used to be.</i> I'm gonna need your name.
All right, let's see what we got here.
Connor!
Got a compound tib-fib fracture to the right leg.
It's pretty nasty.
Got some bone hanging out.
Sir, can you feel when I do this?
Oh, God. Yeah, yeah.
Good. Then his pedal pulse is strong, which means he's still got blood flowing.
PERRLA response is good.
Pupils are equal and reactive.
All right, sir, I'm gonna give you something to help with the pain, but you have to try and stay still.
After a fall like that, we can't rule out spinal injury.
This is all your fault.
I wasn't the one climbing up the trellis like some two-bit cat burglar.
It's 'cause you kicked me out.
Okay? It was either sneak in or sleep in my car.
You had plenty of other options.
Like -- I don't know -- get a job, pay rent.
You don't need rent! You're rich!
It's called hard work paying off.
Will you stop being so hard on him?
He's just going through a quarter-life crisis.
That's a load of...
That's a real thing.
I've been there.
You need to stop enabling him.
You want to be the good cop, so you always make me the bad cop.
I'm sick of it.
Can't you both be good cops?
No.
No.
No.
Let's get him on a backboard.
But does tough love actually work, or does it just make your kid hate you?
Some kids need discipline.
But not too much.
I'm curious to know what your definition of "too much discipline" is.
All right, one, two, three.
Officer? I'd like you to arrest this man.
You want her to arrest your son?
They're related?
We have a restraining order against him.
He wouldn't leave. He was taking us for everything we got.
I had to do something.
Are you gonna arrest him?
You might want to check this out first.
Looks like the bolts have been snapped, real clean breaks.
That's why the kid fell down.
Any idea how that happened?
Nope, no idea.
Well, you were up there a few days ago repairing it.
What kind of repairs? Yeah.
Just, uh, some basic stuff. It was fine the last time I broke in.
See?
That's what I'm talking about.
He's been breaking in for weeks.
He needed to be taught a lesson.
Are you saying that you knew your son was using the trellis, and you cut it intentionally to cause bodily harm?
To your own flesh and blood.
You've coddled him too long, Trish.
You need to decide whose side you're on.
<i>Is he gonna</i> be okay?
Well, he'll need surgery, and it'll be a long recovery, but he'll make it.
Don't worry, sweetheart. Mommy will take care of you.
Trish, you're making a mistake!
You know what? Find a new place to live, Harv.
I'm changing the locks.
Interesting parenting techniques.
Yeah. That kid is never growing up.
You're home. I am running so late.
Jee's having a fussy morning.
She cries every time I put her down.
Um, I fed her an hour ago so you're good for two.
There's breast milk in the fridge, but not much else.
So maybe you could get some groceries?
Oh, and don't forget, Albert has his physical therapy at 3:00 p. m., okay?
Love you. I love you. Bye.
Did you get all that?
Yeah, me, neither.
Oh...
WOMAN She's coming. She's coming.
Surprise!
Oh, my God.
You guys did not have to do this.
Well, of course we do.
We didn't get a chance to throw you a shower.
Well, the least we can do is give you a good welcome back.
Mm-hmm. That one is for baby. Aw.
This is for Mommy.
Uh, how does it feel being back?
Weird. I mean, I haven't left the house in two months, except for doctor's appointments.
Ah, just wait for the mom guilt to set in.
And everyone's gonna have advice. Don't take it.
You have to figure out what works best for yourself.
Except for this. Didn't you just say that she should...?
Uh, you can have it all, but you can't do it all.
Delegate, get help. Don't be a martyr.
She's right. It takes a village.
So use your village.
Ah.
It's good to have you back.
It's good to be back.
Let's go get cake.
Yes.
You ready for this?
No. Basically ran out of the house this morning before I could change my mind and not leave Jee's side until she's 40.
I have no idea what that feels like, but...
I do know that I'm here for you, whatever you need.
Other than babysitting. That feels like a lot of pressure.
It's okay. Chimney's got us covered.
Albert, did you take your medicine?
I forgot.
Okay.
Here.
Can you help?
Uh, yeah, sure. Just give me a second.
Aah! Damn it!
Are you okay?
Definitely not.
Mrs. Lee.
Anne. That is still weird for me. Please come in.
Hi, Anne.
I come bearing soup.
Aw. What are you doing?
Why didn't you let me know you were coming?
I would have picked up a little or lit a match.
Nonsense.
No need to make things perfect for me.
Oh. I think she's hungry.
I was just making her a bottle and Albert's lunch.
And I might need to make her another one. Okay.
Here, let me.
I'll feed the baby, you two eat.
Thank you.
So, I know that you didn't just happen to be in the neighborhood.
Did Maddie ask you to come in and check on me?
So suspicious.
You know, Maddie asked me the same question when I called her yesterday.
I just wanted to see if you two needed any help.
That's very sweet of you, but we're fine.
I think we've all got it under control.
We do?
Actually, Anne, do you mind taking me to my therapy session so that Howie doesn't have to?
Happy to.
Hey.
You remembered your appointment. That's great.
Uh, no, but I still know how to read.
You two have busy schedules.
Yeah. I know it looks crazy, but, uh, Maddie and I are making it work.
We don't want to lose a second with Jee-Yun, and leaving her with strangers...
Of course, I...I wouldn't want to overstep.
Oh. No. No, no, no, I-I...
I didn't mean that. That's not what I...
I'm ready.
Great. Um, we should get going.
Well, wait, uh...Well, uh...
See you later, Howie.
Goodbye, Howard.
Well, uh, wait.
Anne?
Thought I'd find you in here, torturing yourself.
It's a little hard to let it go, Ma.
And please don't tell me I knew what I was signing up for.
I wasn't gonna say anything 'cause I don't have the answer.
I wish I did.
I hate to see you hurting like this.
I just miss her.
And I loved her like she was my own.
And a year from now, she won't even remember who I am.
I'm not so sure about that.
She might not be able to recall specific memories, but she will remember how you made her feel.
Loved.
Protected.
Safe.
She won't forget that.
She will carry that with her always.
Because of you.
Honey, I know.
I know.
Let it out.
<i>All right, make sure</i> you have everything you need <i>before you get in the car</i> or your dad will have my head. Uh, Harry, can you pass me my phone?
I said to <i>pass</i> me the phone, not check it. Laila liked your post on Instagram.
Give it. Wait, isn't she that mean girl that you went to high school with?
Why are you talking to her?
She reached out to me a couple weeks ago.
Out of the blue.
Said she wanted to apologize for what happened.
Hmm. And you told her, "Go to hell." No. Um, I met her for coffee and heard her out. That's it.
She trashed your reputation on social media, said terrible lies about you, and that's it?
No big deal?
I feel like I at least owed it to her to listen.
You don't owe her a damn thing.
After what she did to you?
You did arrest her. Or did you forget that part?
I didn't forget a single thing about that...incident.
I-I can't believe that you didn't tell me about this.
Why would you hide it from me?
Hello? This entire conversation.
I never know how you're gonna react these days. You're always worried about me -- you don't like my job, and apparently, now you don't like my friends.
So now she's your friend?
May! What-what-what are you doing?
Letting this girl get back in your head again?
She's changed. I have changed.
So I'm giving her a second chance.
What's wrong with that?
Because the last time you were friends with that girl, you tried to kill yourself!
LAFD!
Can I help you?
LAFD, ma'am. We got a call about an overdose?
You must have the wrong address.
This is 4941 North Orchard Drive.
Yes.
Dispatcher said they got a call from an Ellen Saxton?
What? Uh, that's my mom.
Mama?
Finally.
Mom, wh-what's wrong? You called 911?
Are you okay?
I'm dying, Julia.
Cancer.
Also, I may have taken something to...speed up the dying process.
Oh, my God, Mama. Are you crazy?
Ma'am, what did you take?
I'm not telling. And I'm not crazy.
I still have all of my mental faculties.
But not for long.
Cancer's spreading.
It's in my brain, baby, and I am not sticking around for that.
Blood pressure's 80/40. She's in the danger zone.
Looks like an opioid overdose.
Prepping naloxone.
That won't be necessary.
Or legal.
It's a do-not-resuscitate order.
With signed verification from my doctor.
No lifesaving measures, no medical intervention.
It's all there.
Advanced directives.
Don't listen to her.
D-Do whatever you have to do to save her!
No. You can't save me.
Just...
delaying the inevitable.
Why the hell did you call 911 if you didn't want help?
I called them for you.
So you wouldn't be alone when I go.
Mom, if you don't want me to be alone, don't do this.
We don't know how much time you have left.
It could be months.
I don't care if you're sick.
I want that time with you.
I want all the time I can get.
This isn't living.
It's suffering.
And I'm not talking about me.
I see what this is doing to you, and...
I don't want to do it anymore.
Legally, aren't we obligated to render aid at this point?
We-we can't just stand here and let her...
The DNR is clear.
Legally, we shouldn't do anything.
I-I'm sorry, our hands are tied.
Fine. You can't do it.
I will.
No. No, no.
You gave up your entire life to take care of me.
Well, now it's time for me to give it back.
I can't.
Shh.
I'm not leaving you.
I am setting you free.
When you have your own kids, you'll understand.
Mama, please. I love you.
Oh, I love you, too.
This is the last thing I can do for you, baby.
So let me.
No.

Oh, God! Mom!
What's wrong with May?
Baby, I need you to call <i>your father, tell him</i> to meet me at the hospital.
Pulse is weak and thready. What did she take?
<i>-Uh, hydrocodone.</i> Pupils aren't responding.
<i>Hi. This is May.</i> I'm right here. Can you hear me?
<i>-It's okay.</i> Hi.
<i>This is May. Leave a message.</i> Hey. Hey.
You, uh, talk to May yet?
Mm, keep trying, but she's not answering my calls.
Sending me straight to voice mail.
Sounds like things got pretty heated.
That girl hurt my child.
All bets are off.
She lucky all I did was arrest her.
Sorry if I can't just forgive and forget.
Well, they were kids. She barely knew better.
Oh, she knew what she was doing.
I don't get it.
Why would May want to have anything to do with her after what she put her through?
I don't know.
But I do know that you sometimes don't agree with May's decisions.
You didn't want her to take the job at the call center.
You wanted her to go to college.
I didn't want her to take that job because it's emotionally taxing.
Right. She has been keeping up with her counselor sessions. Seems like she's handling it.
And she's practically an adult now.
You don't have to like her choices, but they are her choices.
And if she says she's fine talking with Laila, maybe you just have to trust that she is.
That's the mistake I made last time.
I trusted that she was fine, and I almost lost her.
She was right here living under my roof, and I didn't know what was going on.
I was so wrapped up with me and Michael and the divorce that I didn't even realize what was going on with my own daughter.
Well, she was a teenager at the time. It's their whole M. O. in life not to let their parents know what's going on.
When it happened, I assumed it was because of me and Michael splitting up, but it was about something I had absolutely no clue about.
None.
Right.
So you-you have to forgive yourself, Athena.
Do you know how many suicide calls I've been on where nobody had any idea? You can't take on that kind of blame.
I'm her mother.
I should have known something was wrong.
But I missed it.
I'm scared she hates me right now.
But I'm more scared that I'm gonna miss it again.
Morning.
I think I did a bad thing.
U-Ultimately good but still bad.
What are you talking about?
I found Nia's birth mother.
Her name is Evangeline Gonzalez.
She works here as a nurse's aide.
Karen, how did you find her?
And isn't that completely against the rules?
Uh, I may have hired a private investigator.
Look, I had to know.
The not knowing was killing me.
Killing you.
I had to know if Nia was gonna be okay.
And is she?
Single mom.
Struggling to make ends meet.
She got evicted.
She was living in her car with Nia.
People saw her, and they called child services, who placed her with us, temporarily, while she got her life back together.
That was January.
And then the pandemic hit.
Not an easy time to be trying to put your life back together.
She couldn't catch a break.
Unless you were willing to work at a long-term care facility.
Mm.
She's been here since June.
The residents love her.
And there's a day care down the street.
She goes over on her lunch hour to eat with Nia.
Every day.
Nia's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
We did the right thing, Hen.
You want to do this again.
I love Nia.
I will always miss having her in our lives.
But knowing that she's with a mother who loves her, that we helped to give them a second chance, I'm proud of us for that.
It's gonna hurt like hell every time we do this.
Yeah.
We're gonna love them like our own and then have to let them go.
But I guess we can take it.
I'm just tired of always fighting with her.
Mm-hmm.
She doesn't think I'm capable of handling anything.
Yeah. But she knows you have a good head on your shoulders.
Hmm? She's just being protective.
And I can't say that I blame her.
But you didn't act like a lunatic when I told you Laila reached out.
Right.
And I wasn't the one that found you either.
What difference does that make?
You know, when Harry called me that day, he said that you were sick, that you and your mom were going to the hospital.
By the time I got there, found out what really happened, it was all so...just confusing and scary.
But you were alive.
Exactly.
You weren't when your mother found you.
You weren't breathing, May.
She thought you were dead.
And she blamed herself for it.
Why would she think that?
They were her pills, May.
Pills that I told her to throw out.
Wait, you blamed her, too?
No.
We both said a lot of things.
Because we were scared.
And then we got past it.
We realized what was the most important thing, and that was just being there for you.
Yeah, not all this guilt and blame.
It was pointless.
I know you think that your mom is made of steel.
She's not.
And I'll never know what she went through when she found you.
And I'm kind of grateful that I never will.

Hey, did you and Albert eat?
Chim.
What? Who's ready to eat?
What did I miss?
You fell asleep while standing.
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm just so tired.
Yesterday I fell asleep while holding the baby.
On the toilet.
How do other people do this?
I don't know.
But I think we might need help.
Yeah.
And I think I know who to call.
I know it's a lot to ask.
Albert can stay with us as long as he likes.
Give you two your space.
And, honestly, I think John's kind of excited about having him around.
Well, life can be pretty boring when you're both retired.
And we're available for babysitting services any time you and Maddie need a night off.
Oh. Albert's medications.
I should grab them, too.
I'll take her.
Okay.
Grandma's gonna hold you while Daddy goes to pack.
Howard, uh, I'm not...
um...
I mean, your mother...
Would be so grateful to you.
That you took in her kid after she was gone, loved him.
Loved me.
You finished the job she started, and...
I'm not sure I ever said thank you for that.
We're family.
Nothing to thank me for.
Okay.
Oh, don't worry, Jee-Yun.
Grandma's got you.
I know it's been really hard, so...
if you're not ready, that's okay.

Oh, she'll like some flowers.
Yeah. Oh, uh...Uh, hey there.
I-I'm sorry to bother you. Would you mind keeping an eye on my cart for a minute?
Daffodils are my wife's favorite.
Pretty sure they put this thing outside so you could grab your flowers on the way in to the store.
I-I'd just really like to surprise her. She's waiting in the car.
I promise, it'll only be a minute.
I'm not supposed to, but make it quick.
Thank you.
<i>No.</i> We-we have to put our foot down.
The call center is not a tourist attraction.
I appreciate the councilman's interest, but we can't have him and his cronies parading through the office.
No, just tell him no, please.
Listen, let me call you back.
It's fine. Go on right ahead.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, wait! W-W-Wait!
Stop! Stop!
God, no!
Ma'am, are you okay?
I've got a pulse.
Oh, my God.
You said you were gonna stay in the car.
She's alive.
I-I'm calling 911. W-Wait, start with the address.
Always give the address first.
Car was parked over by the dumpster.
He hit the gas, then he hit her. Looked pretty bad.
And he just took off? Didn't even slow down.
Hey, you're gonna be okay, sweetie. Okay? Help is here.
You're gonna be fine, okay? Everything...Sir?
Sir, why don't you just step back, let my team have a look.
One, two, three.
Airway's clear, but her breathing's labored.
Definitely a broken femur here.
I know her.
What?
It's Sue Blevins.
From the call center. Yeah. Maddie's boss.
Head injury is pretty severe. Pupils are uneven.
Possible subdural hematoma. Oh, man. Oh, boy.
We need oxygen over here.
Oh, come on, Sue. We can run an IV en route.
Sue, can you hear me? Oh, come on, Sue.
Most likely a broken rib, maybe two.
Oh, come on.
Probable punctured lung, as well.
Let's get her on the board. One, two, three.
Oh, man.
Oh, come on, Sue. Come on.
Nine...
One...
What's she saying?
Nine...one...
911?
We're here, Sue.
We got you.
Nine...one...
He was inside buying flowers for her while someone was trying to kill her.
Thought this was an accident.
The guy never took his foot off the gas, like he wanted that lady dead.
SUE Nine...one...
And I'm gonna need some new sneakers.
Mine are getting too small.
What? Didn't we just buy you those?
It seems like all we have to do is buy a pair of sneakers for his feet to shoot up to the next size.
Yeah, it's a vicious cycle.
He's growing up.
And you both have done a fantastic job raising us.
Letting us be our own independent people.
This conversation just took an unexpected turn.
To the scripted side.
I think it's time I got a place of my own.
You're moving out? This is gonna be great.
I-I've got a job. Money in savings.
I'm ready to live on my own.
Well, this is a big step.
Mm-hmm.
Are you sure you're ready?
I am.
Well, okay, then.
Really?
Yeah. Really?
Well, it seems like you've given this some thought, and you're an adult.
Free to make your own decisions.
Okay. Okay. All right, well, if you're really serious about this, there are a few vacancies in the building across the street from me. Mm.
Oh, with the telescope view.
No.
Good morning, everybody. Hey.
Morning.
You missed the big announcement.
Oh?
Everything okay?
Yeah.
You're late.
Well, I was just checking up on a case from last night.
It was a hit-and-run. Victim was Sue Blevins.
<i>It doesn't make</i> any sense. Who would want to hurt Sue?
A security guard only saw the accident.
Didn't know what happened before.
Maybe some kind of parking lot rage thing?
I was talking to her.
Last night, we were on the phone.
She was in the car, waiting for Don.
She just hung up...
Oh, God.
I-I've got to call Don. He must be beside himself.
Well, do you want to go to the hospital?
I'm sure she's out of surgery. No.
She'd want me here.
"The calls don't stop, and we can't, either." Did she say anything to you when you were there?
No. She, uh, she just kept on saying "911." I don't know how this place runs without her.
It's got you.
And it's got all of us, and we're not gonna let her down because we all owe Sue a lot.
I owe her my life.

It's four days of planning sessions from the partners' retreat.
I'd have called you earlier, but it took us all day just to find them.
We'd transcribe them in-house, but the partners can get a little salty.
I got no problem with a little salt.
Just usually prefer it with a wedge of lime and a good glass of tequila.
But not while I'm on the clock.
I'll leave you to it.
Oh, and we might be here after hours, but I don't know how late.
Oh, it's fine. I'm a night owl.
<i>This is a good deal.</i> <i>You're the one who wanted to expand.</i> <i>-ell, it sounds good, you know, W</i> <i>but I just can't deal with running into Jimmy</i> <i>-in the men's room every day. What's wrong with him?</i> <i>His face. t's just, there's something...I</i> <i>-The Germans</i> <i>have a word for it. A face in need</i> <i>-of a punch.
Backpfeifengesicht.</i> <i>Okay, let's move on to section seven,</i> <i>article 12-C.</i> <i>Oh, come on. But does he have to come</i> <i>-on the executive golf trip? I thought he was</i> <i>-really good at golf, though. It's not about</i> <i>how good he is.</i> <i>She did what with her boss?</i> <i>While his wife was in the next room?</i> <i>So, she comes into my office, and...</i> <i>Wait, hang on.</i> Recording was halted.
Hello?
Is anybody still here?
Damn it.
<i>...this building before, and I don't know what to do,</i> <i>and I-I'm kind of freaking out here.</i> It's okay.
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna get you out of there.
I don't know, Michael.
If you have concerns, maybe you should discuss them with your daughter.
Yes. Without me.
Okay. Talk later.
Michael's worried about May moving into her own place?
He thinks we should talk her out of it.
Have a family meeting. Present a united front.
I said no, thank you.
Hmm.
You're surprised.
Well, it just seems like...
A fight I would have with my daughter? I know.
No, Athena, that's not what I was gonna say.
It wasn't gonna be a criticism.
Well, maybe it should be.
I keep thinking about the argument she and I had about Laila.
And that's not the relationship I ever wanted to have with my daughter. She's just too much like me.
And if I try to hold on too tight, I'm just gonna drive her away.
Athena, you are not Beatrice.
You're not your mother.
In that moment, it felt like I was.
<i>Hey, so,</i> what do you know about the 911 call center?
Uh, next to nothing.
Your sister works there, right?
Yeah, she does. Uh, her boss, Sue, is really great.
She's actually been at the call center since it opened.
Since the '60s?
No.
That's-that's when they created the number. Call center here in L. A. didn't open till 1984.
And did you know dispatchers aren't even classified as first responders in most parts of the country?
Which is crazy.
Uh, only changed here in California last year.
Interesting.
Yeah?
Hey. So, um, the other night, Sue was hit by a car.
Uh, driver just took off.
That's awful.
Did you know less than ten percent of hit-and-runs ever get solved?
Yes, though it doesn't feel like you're just citing another interesting fact now.
So, police have no leads.
I checked.
And I figured maybe the public could help, but the public would need to know about the hit-and-run.
Oh.
Maybe if they saw it on the news?
It just so happens I have, uh, a friend who's also a fantastic reporter.
And I-I thought maybe she could do me a favor.
If I'm gonna sell this to my assignment editor, I'm gonna need a better hook than just a hit-and-run.
Okay. Uh, like what?
Tell me more about the call center.
<i>Sue took a pretty bad hit.</i> A concussion, plus some pretty severe internal injuries.
But she's out of surgery, and Don says she did well.
God. I think I took that call. I didn't know.
There's no way for you to know.
Woman who called it in never said Sue's name.
What about the guy who hit her?
Police are still looking.
I'm...I'm not sure what else we...
Uh, if people need someone to talk to?
Yes. Counselors are available if anyone needs to talk.
And I'm here if you need anything.
I'll update you as I get more information, but until then...
Just keep Sue in your thoughts.
Okay.
<i>Josh, don't go any further, okay?</i> I need you to climb. Go up.
No...
Up?
No, that sounds like a really stupid idea.
<i>Doesn't smoke rise?</i> I should go down.
Yeah, I'm going down. <i>-Don't.</i> Listen to me.
The fire.
I think it's coming from the floor below.
What do I do now?
<i>Sir, you need to calm down.</i> <i>No! This woman is trying to kill me!</i> I thought you said she was blocking your car in?
Yeah, she is, with a baseball bat!
Get out of that car and tell me where my child is!
I told you, I ain't seen Tracie in a month.
I swear fore God, Keith, I'm not playing with you!
Probably longer.
Liar!
Come on out, coward!
If you hit that vehicle, I have to arrest you.
Oh, thank you.
My daughter's missing!
I know he did something to her!
I understand you're upset, but getting yourself arrested will not solve anything.
Why are you talking to her?! She's been terrorizing me for the past half an hour. You need to arrest her!
Shut your mouth and that window.
Tell me about your daughter.
Tracie. Just turned 21.
She's been gone for two days.
Hasn't been home, hasn't been to work.
Her friends haven't heard from her.
I'm losing my mind here.
You think he knows where she is?
She broke it off with him a few weeks back.
And he's not the type who likes to be told "no." Talk and don't even think about lying to me.
Uh, I don't know where she is.
I haven't seen or talked to her in weeks.
Where have you been the last two days?
Moving into my mama's basement.
A million people saw me there.
I'm gonna need you to start making a list of those million people.
Okay.
Did you file a police report?
They asked me if I was sure she didn't just run away.
Then they said they'd get back to me.
I'm not holding my breath.
Didn't seem like my girl was a high priority.
Well, she is now.
Hey.
You looking for me?
You know there's nothing in that case file aside from a photo and the initial statement from her mother?
This is Nelson's case, right?
Would be if he were working it. Instead, he decided to wait and see.
Maybe she'll just come back on her own.
She's not the kind of missing girl that makes the evening news.
Solid job, solid family.
No history of drugs or alcohol.
Oh. There's an ex.
Yeah, with an alibi.
I was gonna go by her place of business, talk to the folks there.
Well, you want some company?
I'm sure Nelson won't mind.
I'm sure Nelson won't notice.
<i>Sue Blevins remains in ritical condition at this hour. c</i> <i>Police currently have no leads and fear</i> <i>this case could end up like most hit-and-runs</i> <i>in our city -- unsolved.</i> This is great. Maybe now they'll catch this guy.
I still can't believe the driver just took off.
Yeah. Happens all the time.
People getting away with murder.
Sue's not dead, Jamal.
She's gonna pull through.
<i>Crash cart</i> coming in!
Starting compressions.
All right, O2 sats. Inject her, perfusion.
Still no pulse.
All right, let's prep her for moving out.
Don?
I was sitting with her, waiting for her to wake up, and I thought she was starting to speak, and then, this alarm went off, and everybody came rushing in there.
Go! Go!
Watch out! Coming through!
Where are you taking her?
Emergency surgery.
She's bleeding internally. The doctor'll explain in a second.
Is she gonna be okay?
We'll do our best.
It's all right. It's all right.
Josh, I need you to climb. Go up.
<i>Doesn't smoke rise?</i> I should go down.
Yeah, I'm going down. <i>-Don't.</i> Listen to me.
Oh, God.
Someone else is here.
In the stairwell?
There's a woman.
I think she might've fallen trying to get out of here.
Is she breathing?
I think so?
Fire's getting closer!
You need to get out of there, Josh.
I can't leave her. She could die.
Okay, here's what you need to do.
Roll her onto her back.
<i>Now push her up so she's sitting up.</i> <i>Get behind her and give her a hug.</i> <i>Grab her wrists and lift her to her feet.</i> <i>Don't use your back.</i> No, I'm lifting with my legs.
Learned that last year in the parking lot of IKEA.
Make sure her knees are locked so you can get in front of her.
<i>ut your back against her chest.
P</i> <i>Now bend your knees and lift her onto your back.</i> <i>Get her arms all the way</i> <i>-over your shoulders.</i> What now?
Move. Fast as you can.
<i>Don't go down. There should be less smoke</i> <i>-a few floors up.</i> Okay.
Heading up.
<i>A few more. You can do this.</i> I'm at 34.
You're almost there.
<i>Just passed 35.</i> 36. <i>-That's far enough.</i> <i>You should be clear of the smoke.</i> Just a few more steps.
What...What do I do?
Find a wall and help her slide down.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
<i>I think so.</i> <i>LAFD is en route and should be there soon.</i> <i>I'll stay on the line until they get there.</i> We got them. Here they are.
Can you walk?
M-Maybe.
Get up.
Checking for respiration and O2 sats.
Let's put her on two liters of oxygen.
You okay?
Thank you.
I'm the wrong guy to thank.
I just showed up after some Good Samaritan carried you up five flights.
Hey, Cap, where's our hero?
I think this lady wants to say thank you.
Long gone. On his way to the ER.
Sorry. Guess we just missed him.
<i>She's still in surgery.</i> Probably for the next few hours.
Don sent me home. He didn't want me up all night when I'm supposed to work tomorrow.
So maybe you should stay home.
I can't.
Look, I know that you want to take care of the place and all of us while she's not there, but you need to take care of yourself, too.
It's like she always says, "We've all got people we love out there.
The best thing we can do is our jobs." I remember you saying that to me.
I got it from her.
I got all my best stuff from her.
I'm really scared, Maddie.
Me, too.
But you know what?
W-We are just gonna have all the faith in her that she's had in all of us, right?
She's gonna pull through this.
<i>I didn't even know</i> there was a missing girls case.
Exactly.
That's the problem.
I'm a police officer, and I didn't know there was a missing girl.
That mother came to us for help, and they couldn't be bothered.
"Wait and see if she turns up." We wouldn't be waiting and seeing if that was a 20-something-year-old white woman.
We'd be out combing the streets.
Mm-hmm. You know, when I was a kid, the cops used to do a community outreach in my neighborhood.
They'd, like, you know, play basketball with the kids, do little dances with them.
Always coming to the cookout, so to speak.
But to this day, I have never seen police hooping with kids in Beverly Hills.
You know, it makes you wonder, why, why do they need to know us to do the job that they're paid for?
Tens of thousands of missing people.
And we just write them off.
You thinking about that little girl?
The one who disappeared when you were a kid?
No.
I'm thinking about my little girl.
May wants to move out, get a place of her own.
I bet you shut that down real quick.
Why does everybody think I'm such a hard-ass that all I know how to do is say no?
Don't answer that.
I told her it would be okay.
You know, giving Nia back was the hardest thing I've ever done.
Mm.
And not just because I loved her as my own, or that she had become part of the family.
It was the fear that she was going back into a bad situation.
That someone would hurt her, and I wouldn't be there to protect her.
Well, May's an adult.
I have to accept that I can't protect her anymore.
All the bad things that you see in the world, Athena, and your...your baby bird is trying to leave the nest?
You're allowed to be scared.
You know what scares me more?
Becoming that voice inside my daughter's head that makes her doubt herself.
Then don't.
Be the voice that teaches her to protect herself when the world doesn't.
If she wants to leave the nest...
be the voice that teaches her how to fly.
<i>But now, veteran 911 dispatcher Sue Blevins</i> <i>-finds herself in her own harrowing crisis.</i> You know her, right?
The hostage thing at dispatch last year?
Oh, we go further back than that.
<i>According to witnesses,</i> <i>Blevins was hit by a red Vero Galaxy,</i> <i>prompting a 911 call...</i> I checked the log.
Tracie signed out of the employee lot at 6:07.
I thought you were open till 9:00.
For sales. Service department closes at 6:00.
Girls are usually gone by 6:15.
The girls?
Meredith works the desk with Tracie.
It's like what I told Mrs. Webber.
We finished work. I was ready to leave.
She wanted to hit the ladies' room first, and so we said good night.
That was the last time I saw her.
Okay, good.
Now I want you to tell me what you didn't tell her mother.
What was she doing at a casino?
Winning, apparently.
Her coworker said she'd go a couple of nights a week, clean up playing poker.
So, what, she was hustling guys at cards?
I didn't say that. I said she was good.
Whatever the guys assumed about her skills, that's on them.
What about this guy?
They're talking, but she keeps a good distance.
Never looks at him.
I'm guessing they probably didn't come in together.
No...but they left together.
Mm. Hmm.
Too much to drink?
Waitress said she didn't serve her alcohol.
Two iced teas and a water.
She's clearly tipsy.
Right there -- when she leans down and grabs her purse.
He moves his hand. He put something in her drink.
And then walks her out the door.
Maybe we'll get lucky, and he'll drive towards the camera.
Who knew you were the optimistic type?
There he is.
Oh, plate's obscured. He must have one of those blocker covers.
Looks like a Galaxy. What do you think?
Burgundy or red?
Red.
That was definitive.
What's the time stamp on that?
8:47.
9:02.
A red Vero Galaxy spotted fleeing the scene.
What scene? Casino?
No.
Hit-and-run.
I think Sue Blevins saw our kidnapper.
Hey!
Got here as fast as I could. Y-You find something?
I talked to one of the security guards.
She let me see the parking lot surveillance footage.
There's something weird here.
Let me see.
Maybe I should just tell you.
Uh, why?
Because you know her.
Uh, come on, l-let me see anyway.
Wow, he, uh, he really didn't slow down.
I just can't figure out why she's running towards the car.
Maybe she saw something she wasn't supposed to.
Uh, she-she sees the guy in his car.
She gets out to confront him.
He runs her over.
But what could she have seen?
I mean, look at where the car was parked.
Only thing over there are the dumpsters.
You know, I-I heard about this illegal plastic surgery clinic a few months back.
Guy was tossing evidence in the dumpster.
What if our driver did, too?
Should we call the police?
Eventually.
I mean, we're already here.
I do happen to have gloves in my car.
on't even think about it, Buck.
D Oh, Athena!
Finally. Uh, you find anything in the dumpster?
We found a handbag and the I. D.
of the missing girl.
I still don't understand what this girl has to do with Sue.
Tracie Webber was kidnapped less than a mile away from the supermarket.
We think she might have been in the car that hit Sue.
That would explain why the driver was gunning for her.
So she couldn't tell anyone what she saw.
"911." Nine...one...
one.
When we got on the scene, Sue was trying to talk.
Don thought she was saying 911, but maybe it was about the car.
A license plate number?
They don't start with three digits, unless it's a vanity plate.
What if it wasn't a "one"?
More like a-a "wuh," you know?
Nine, one, "wuh." Okay, let's run it.
Red Vero Galaxy.
Partial plate.
Nine, one...
William.
Station lawyers are already on their way.
Might want to call your cameraman instead.
Yes.
<i>A kidnapping alert, statewide.</i> <i>Red Vero Galaxy.

Dispatch, 118 is on scene, at the gate.
Where exactly do you need us?
118, stand by at your location and stage until the scene is secure.
Copy that, staging.
It's been long enough, hasn't it?
Cap, that girl's been drugged.
We need to get in there.
Yeah, they got the suspect yet?
Officers now advising the scene is clear for you to respond.
Okay, let's move!
118, on the move, coming to you.
5-Adam-32, 118 approaching your location.
I thought it was this way!
Aren't they this way?
Did Dispatch give us a box number?
No. Hey!
Over here!
All right, guys, let's go! Let's get in there.
No sign of the suspect?
Nothing. Must've scared him off.
Dispatch, this is 118...
<i>Dispatch, 118,</i> we are at the container with the victim.
Copy. Advise the boxcar number?
Container box number...
228, copy.
Fresh bruises on her wrists, Cap.
Pretty hard to tell how long he's had her in here.
Not labeled.
Could be fentanyl or Ativan or bleach for all we know.
And how many injections?
She's about to stop breathing any second now.
Prep the naloxone. If it's not an opioid, one dose will not hurt her.
And it could actually help.
She's got severe dehydration. Pushing fluids.
<i>-Dispatch, backup has arrived. Copy, units on scene</i> searching the area for the suspect who's possibly still in the general area.
One gigantic area.
Let's contain this container yard, shall we?
Units, let's set a perimeter.

5-Adam-38, take northeast.
<i>5-Adam-19, show you taking southeast.</i> 5-Adam-26, on southwest.

Suspect in sight near unit 85.
SWAT has been activated.
But they're ten minutes out.
We lost visual of the suspect.
Dispatch, I think we're lost.
We're in a maze.
Lots of the same thing in every direction.
Linda? ETA on my bird?
They're saying they're unavailable.
Negative. Tell them I've got an armed suspect and officers who are as good as sitting ducks.
I need an aerial visual assist.

And thanks, for having our back.
That's why we're here.
Josh Russo?
I'm Sue Blevins.
You're you.
The voice that saved my life.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So that call, which was, like, the worst moment of my life, that was just a day that ends in Y for you.
Well, we're not quite that blasé about it, but yes, that's the job.
You're really good at it.
How did you know to send me upstairs?
Well, initial fire call came from two floors below, that's why you could smell the smoke.
I was afraid that the stairwell was fully engulfed.
So sending you to an unfinished floor, well, it seemed safer than asking you to walk through fire.
Though, as it turns out, you were willing to do that to help a stranger.
Still not sure where that came from.
I've never been the heroic type.
Well, all evidence to the contrary.
I'm just a freelance stenographer.
It's a real thing.
Oh.
That I kind of don't want to do anymore.
Not sure what I'd do instead.
Well, you have experience listening and typing all day.
Maybe you want my job?
But only if we can do something about these chairs.
Sweetie, you're gonna need some time.
I know you don't think so. You g...
Heard you were awake.
Finally.
Josh.
Come on in, kid.
Look, I'm trying to talk this one into taking a few weeks off, but all she wants to do is talk about going back to work.
Help me talk some sense into her.
Please. She doesn't know how to not work.
I mean, who tries to stop a kidnapping off duty?
Well, it wasn't as if I planned it.
No, Josh, we-we have to put our foot down.
The call center is not a tourist attraction.
I appreciate the councilman's interest, but we can't have him and his cronies parading through the office.
No, just tell him no, please.
Listen, uh, let me call you back.
No. No, no, no, no, no!
No, no! Wait! W-W-Wait!
Stop! Stop!
Is the girl okay?
She's safe.
Thanks to you.
Ransone.
Where's Tracie? Looking forward to seeing you.
Mom?
I'm here, baby.
Heard she wasn't the first girl.
Probably the third.
We got lucky.
We found her just in time.
I'm not sure how lucky she feels.
You changed your mind about me moving out?
No. I know that this is something that's important to you, but knowing that you're okay?
That's what's important to me.
So I've made a list of acceptable neighborhoods, what to look for in a building, what to avoid.
These are my conditions.
Oh. This is a lot of conditions.
Some are negotiable. Some are not.
Starting with no first-floor apartments, no balconies.
Also, once you've narrowed down the field, I want to take a look in person, meet your building manager.
Run a background check?
I just want to keep you safe.
I know.
<i>Tracie Webber is currently hospitalized with injuries</i> <i>described as significant but not life-threatening.</i> <i>-And her kidnapper Patrick yan Boyd is in custody tonight.
R</i> <i>Boyd was apprehended after a massive effort</i> <i>by police, fire and EMS.</i> <i>Coordinated by the people Sue Blevins...</i> Hey, uh, you're here, but you're on my TV.
I'm a rerun.
They aired the same segment at 10:00 and 11:00.
A gift from my boss. He wants to have lunch tomorrow.
Uh, maybe you'll get a promotion, huh?
Maybe, but that's not what we're celebrating.
No? Uh, okay.
What are we celebrating?
Justice.
For Tracie Webber and Sue Blevins.
I hear they're both gonna be okay.
Welcome back to Sue!
All units stand by.
Dispatcher with I. D. number 17, advise your status.
Dispatcher Blevins...
back in service.
<i>Dispatcher Blevins...Welcome back!</i> <i>Oh, Sue, it's good to hear your voice.</i> <i>Welcome back, Sue. You rock, Blevins. Welcome back.</i> <i>-t wasn't the same without you.
I</i> <i>We missed you. Glad to have you back,- Blevins.</i> <i>Welcome back, Blevins.</i> <i>It's great to have you back.</i> Thank you, everyone.
You're not gonna get rid of me that easy.
Now back to work.
911. What's your emergency?
 @@@@@@
All you got to do is hang on.
Push through the pain.
"911," all-new Mondays.
And watch other Fox shows like "Lone Star," "Prodigal Son," and "The Resident" on Fox.
Check it out! This one's called "Artemisia californica." Sagebrush.
I liked it better when you knew the names of dolls.
Dad, I never played with dolls.
Ooh!
Emma? Where'd you go?
Can you believe this?
Oh, what you got there?
Dad, look. I think there's a note inside.
Oh. Okay.
Oh.
Is that blood?
Oh, boy.
Do you have a more precise location?
<i>Uh...upstream, I think.</i> Tell 'em they could be up near the headwaters, Dad.
Yeah.
They could be up near the headwaters, but <i>we can't see anything from here.</i> You can't see the person? Then, <i>what makes you think someone's trapped?</i> We found a message in a bottle.
<i>Dispatch, this is Fire Rescue One. We are on the scene.</i> <i>Copy that, Fire One.</i> Engine and Rescue 118 are landing now.
<i>Rangers think the bottle may have come from the headwaters</i> <i>of the creek, south by southwest of your position,</i> <i>near the rocks.</i> <i>Copy that, dispatch.</i> 8,000 acres to search. We could be waiting awhile.
Are they sure someone's up there?
That bottle could have been floating around for months.
Which would mean our search and rescue might become a search and recovery.
Note was written on a receipt.
Rangers checked the date.
It was five days ago.
Sure hope it wasn't their last meal.
<i>We see you, Captain Nash. We're coming in now.</i> Copy that.
Okay, Chimney, Eddie, gear up. You're going with them.
Copy that. You'll harness up, we'll lower you down so you can grab him.
Cheer up. You can go next time.
<i>Okay, first quadrant is right over that ridge.</i> <i>Head up to Devil's Point.</i> <i>A lot of hikers get stuck up there.</i> <i>Copy that, Cap.</i> Pretty sure there's a river, too.
It could be where they threw the bottle in.
I think I see something.
Help! Please!
Down here! Help, please!
Okay, we got him.
Let's get in a hover position right here.
Looks like severe dehydration.
He's gonna need this.
Ready?
Piece of cake.
Be advised, air support gonna maintain 50 feet.
Lowering rescuer now.
Rescuer at ten feet.
Rescuer on the ground.
I'm Eddie. What's your name?
I'm Clyde.
There's willow trees around here, right?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna feel pretty dumb.
You're burning up.
Drink this. It's got electrolytes.
How long have you been up here, Clyde?
Five days, maybe?
I'm not sure.
I was trying to get high enough to look around, and then I fell.
I thought I could tough it out, but I ran out of food and water.
Yup. Looks like you broke it.
We'll get this splint on you, and we're gonna get you out of here.
No. No! No, I'm fine.
Just give me some painkillers or something.
I got a couple more spots I got to check out, and I can just ride it out until I'm done here.
That's a negative, Clyde. Chim, prep fluids.
Our guy's gonna need it.
Oh, man.
Sir, let's get this on you.
We're gonna ride up together.
Oh, thanks.
That's our cue. Hold steady, Fire One.
I'm bringing him up.
All right, buddy. We got you. We got you.
Dispatch, all souls on board.
Returning to base.
Careful! He's kind of delirious. Been out there awhile.
Said he injured himself three days ago.
I'm fine. I just want to know when I can get back up there.
Definitely not today.
Do you have a cell phone?
Doesn't everyone? Yes.
But most people use it to call for help instead of putting a message in a bottle.
Battery died yesterday.
That was two days after you injured yourself.
I didn't want to leave.
I was so close.
I didn't want anyone else to find the treasure.
It's mine! The treasure's mine!
Don't tell anyone!
Don't let anyone take it.
It's mine!
The treasure's mine!
Did he say "treasure"?
<i>This is Channel 8 with breaking news.</i> <i>Hollis Harcourt, the author of such cult classics</i> <i>as</i> Agony in Atwater <i> and</i> Bludgeoned in Burbank, <i>passed away in his sleep at age 57,</i> <i>leaving behind an intriguing message</i> <i>to his loyal fans.</i> <i>Behold. My final gift to the citizens of Los Angeles --</i> <i>a rare and priceless treasure.</i> <i>Though, if I had to put a price on it for tax purposes,</i> <i>I'd call it about $5 million.</i> Whoa. Five million.
<i>I'm gonna bury this chest somewhere</i> <i>in the city of Los Angeles.</i> <i>If you are clever, as I know you are,</i> <i>one of you will find this chest, and the treasure will be yours.</i> <i>We spoke with Harcourt's longtime assistant,</i> <i>Jeremiah Ruiz, moments ago.</i> <i>Hollis was...passionate.</i> <i>He had high standards.</i> <i>But he was a good soul.</i> <i>He cared about people and their stories.</i> <i>He will be missed.</i> <i>And he won't be forgotten.</i> <i>At least not any time soon.</i> <i>According to his final video,</i> <i>Hollis buried that $5 million treasure</i> <i>somewhere in the city</i> <i>that was the setting for most of his work.</i> <i>A poem he recited in the video is said</i> <i>to provide all the clues needed to locate it.</i> <i>"I walked along</i> the river's edge, to hide my secret treasure." This poem is terrible.
"A heron soared, a gray bridge roared, a bullfrog croaked 'Good measure.'" It's less of a poem, and more of a riddle.
Fine. It's a terrible riddle.
"I stopped beneath a willow tree in the narrow place.
And then I saw the light beam fall upon my treasured place." You know, the guy on the cliff -- he asked me about willow trees.
A real-life treasure hunt.
Wouldn't it be...?
Dangerous.
Reckless.
Stupid.
Probably not even real.
What if it is?
How cool would it be to find it?
You know, this poem-riddle thing is getting a lot of traffic.
Yeah, which means our friend Clyde is likely not the last emergency we're gonna see from this treasure hunt.
Your girlfriend's news story's probably not gonna help out with that.
She's my friend, not my girlfriend, and she's just doing her job. Reporting the news.
Well, tell her to stop.
We got enough work without people creating their own emergency.
Well, at least it was the midday news.
Maybe the whole thing dies off.
Before anyone actually dies.
I guess.
Uh, hey.
<i>-I just saw you on the TV.
And I heard a rumor</i> you guys responded to a call about a treasure hunter in Malibu Creek? <i> Yeah.</i> He didn't find anything, though.
Not that there's anything to find.
<i>I mean, the whole thing's probably fake, right?</i> I'm not so sure. Hollis's assistant confirmed he saw the treasure himself before Hollis died.
I didn't see that part on TV.
<i>He wanted to keep it off the record.</i> In case this thing gets crazy, he doesn't want anyone to come looking for him.
<i>So this is real?</i> There's $5 million out there just-just waiting to be found?
<i>-Looks like it.
You know, uh,</i> I bet if we compared notes, we could probably figure out where he buried that treasure.
You're saying you want to team up?
<i>Look for the treasure together?</i> We'd be, uh, we'd be doing a public service.
Hmm. <i> We find it so</i> no one else has the chance to get hurt.
Yeah. And I mean, clearly, it's my duty to keep the city informed.
<i>The sooner that treasure is found,</i> the safer the city will be.
Everybody wins.
Maybe not everybody.
<i>-My final gift to the citizens of Los Angeles...
Nuts.</i> Please tell me that's not porn or sports.
This? This is our future. Apparently, a guy buried $5 million somewhere in the city, then told people to go out and find it.
I miss the days when bored rich people would just name wings of museums and hospitals after themselves.
Have we had a conversation with this misguided citizen?
Yeah, that's a little hard to do.
He's been dead a week.
Did we post uniforms at his grave site?
You know, that's one of the first places people are gonna start digging.
Kevin, find out where he's buried.
Send some units. Thanks.
How bad do you think this is gonna get?
Ugh. City's coming out of a near yearlong lockdown.
Everyone's still a little stir-crazy.
This?
This is gonna send them over the edge.
<i>The search for Hollis Harcourt's</i> <i>$5 million took another turn today</i> <i>in Topanga Canyon. This marks the second serious injury</i> <i>in the so-called treasure hunt.</i> <i>With local officials reporting that treasure hunt-related</i> <i>emergency calls are climbing every day.</i> Where did you say the fight is?

Everybody's working alone.
I guess people are greedy, don't want to share the treasure.
Maybe that's the flaw in their plan.
Two brains are better than one.
What if we worked on it together, split the $5 million fifty-fifty?
Sorry, I, uh, already made a deal with Taylor.
How would you feel about 33-and-a-third?
Mm.
You need to give him 50% of your cut.
We're not splitting it three ways.
Do you really need the extra $400 K that bad?
I already promised my cameraman I'd split my half with him.
So we split it four ways.
Okay? It's still more than a million each.
And 25% of nothing is still nothing.
We're missing something.
I did some research on the whole willow tree thing.
Do you guys know there's something called an arroyo willow?
It's not a tree.
More like a shrub.
Hard to stop beneath it.
Okay. I'll just be over here, then.
Thinking. By myself.
Go team. We still have too many options.
We need more data to rule some of these out.
Well, I think we know a guy.
I wonder how many dumb treasure hunt calls we're gonna get today.
I know. It's been crazy, right?
I think we had four yesterday.
Uh, oh, yeah?
What were they?
Oh. Well, you know, there's a homeless guy...
Feel that, Hen?
Oh, I feel a definite chill.
We've been left out in the cold.
I think it's time we show them how it's done.
<i>No, sir, the paramedics</i> are on their way to you now.
It's not at the observatory.
Oh...
Who thought <i>that</i> was a good idea?
Not it! Hollis's fifth book, <i>Stabbed Beneath the Stars.</i> The murder takes place at the observatory.
911. What's your emergency?
<i>There's ants everywhere!</i> I'm sorry, did you say "ants"?
Fire ants.
Looks like he stepped into a whole colony.
Let's hope he's not allergic.
Or a good guesser.
Two sections of inch-and-three-quarter line with a narrow fog.
Should be enough for us to knock those ants right off.
We'll make a water curtain.
40 psi!
Okay, get in there.
You've got to stay still.
Try to stay still. Checking airway for swelling.
Bilateral breath sounds are clear and undiminished.
No stridor noted.
Pushing fluids, 25 of diphenhydramine, with some epi and solumedrol to mitigate this venom reaction.
Try to stay still.
And five of morphine for the pain.
All right, let's load him up.
Wonder what made him want to dig out here.
Guess you'll never know.
Yeah. What did make you think to dig out here?
All right, this way, up the hall.
Could we leave yet?
Hey, you know what? I know my rights.
It's called the Constitution.
Hey, Athena.
Picked this one up at the Melrose Trading Post, trying to steal a chest from one of the street vendors.
It was a misunderstanding.
That looked just like the one on the video.
The markings are very distinctive.
Yeah, she was also arrested three days ago at the Beaumont Flea Market -- similar misunderstanding.
Maybe not that distinctive.
The Manson Tunnel.
You gotta look in the Manson Tunnel.
For a buried treasure?
What treasure?
Okay, time to go. Let's chat about what's in the Manson Tunnel.
Okay, let's book her and hope she doesn't make bail by Saturday.
I hear <i>Antiques Roadshow is gonna be in Pasadena.</i> I'd hate for there to be another misunderstanding.
Copy that.
Bobby?
Oh, hey, I, uh, I'm just making some breakfast.
Oh, sounds great.
Did you have as crazy a shift as I did?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Super crazy.
I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of these treasure-hunting fools.
What was that?
Uh, it's just a project that I'm working on.
You want some French toast?
I'm gonna make you some French toast.
A-Athena, you want some...you want some coffee?
How about some, uh...you want some eggs?
Oh, God.
Not you, too.
So, these are the woods, parks around L. A.
where you find creeks or rivers.
The red pins, that's where you find willow trees.
Now, the white pins are where you find herons.
The green, bullfrogs.
I'm not sure what the "gray bridge roared" means yet.
I think it might be a metaphor.
This is very...
thorough.
And I'm making some headway.
I think the treasure is here in Solstice Canyon.
There is a creek...
Arrested someone there this morning.
Uh...
No treasure.
Damn.
I thought I was really onto something there.
Guess I'm gonna have to recalibrate.
I think I do, too.
Where did this come from?
What, the whiteboard? I picked it up at the store on the way home.
No.
I mean this sudden desire to go searching for hidden treasure.
I don't know. I just, I saw other people looking for it -- and, I mean, it's $5 million -- and I figured, where's the harm?
It's no different than playing the lottery, right?
No one ever ended up in the ICU buying a lottery ticket.
There was that one incident where the two peo...
Okay. Doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna go doing anything reckless.
I'm not gonna go scaling cliffs or dig around gas mains.
This is just dreaming.
About the money.
What would we do with it?
I thought if I found it, I would surprise you with trust funds for the kids, a new kitchen, maybe even a whole new house.
I thought we could take that honeymoon we never had, see the world.
Hmm.
Hell...
we could even decide to retire.
Retire?
I thought you loved your job.
I do. But jobs like ours, nobody does them forever.
Eventually you hang it up and go fishing.
Not me. I mean, you can have your fishing cabin or whatever at Lake Arrowhead.
We can go up on the weekends.
But I plan to be out on those streets, until they force me off them.
Somebody almost did.
You nearly died last year, Athena.
I know you don't like to talk about it, but it was a really close call.
And most people would have at least thought about quitting.
Retiring.
I did. Elaine brought it up.
She wanted me to seriously consider it, so I did.
And I decided not to.
You never told me that.
Well, I didn't see the point. The decision was already made.
I mean, what was there to say?
So, what was that about that French toast?
I see you've requested the Willow Tree Suite.
I think the two of you will enjoy it.
You and your, uh...?
Oh, uh, boyfriend.
For now.
Oh.
Actually, you know, just between us...
I really think this could be the weekend.
Like <i>the</i> weekend, you know?
I mean, just one last score.
I...I mean, your romantic setting is, uh...I think he'll finally be ready.
Love it.
I'll send champagne up to the room, set the mood.
And where is the lucky fella?
He's just outside. Yeah.
Just, you know, getting our stuff from the car.
Uh, so, um...
"River's Edge." You guys getting a lot of business lately, or...?
Actually, it's been, uh, pretty good.
Hey. Why you looking over there?
Willow Tree Suite's that way.
Wasn't over there, babe. Trust me, I got a nose for this kind of thing.
I do trust you.
Hey, babe?
Yeah, babe?
Look, you know I love our adventures, right?
Uh-huh.
I was thinking...
like, if we do find this five mil, maybe we could call it quits on the schemes.
Check it out! The ground here is super soft.
I bet somebody just dug it up.
Yeah. Okay, the grass does not look dug-up.
Baby, they're hiding treasure.
It wouldn't look dug-up.
Okay.
There is definitely something down here. Hey!
Get away from there!
Hey, okay, uh, keep digging. I'll hold him off.
Digging? What are you doing?
Digging on my property?
Sir...
You can't dig there!
Baby?
Ah, man.
Oh! What is that smell?
Septic tank. Roof rusted through.
Woman's been stuck down there for seven minutes.
A tank like that is likely full of methane.
We're gonna need some breathable air.
Let's get on it. What's the name of the woman down there?
Keisha. She just fell in.
Okay, gentlemen, this ground could still give way.
I'm gonna need you to step back.
We don't want you falling in, too. Keisha, just sit tight. We're gonna get you out of there.
Not exactly going anywhere.
What were you doing out here?
Duh. Digging up the treasure.
What treasure?
River's Edge B&B?
Willow Tree Suite? Of course it's here.
It is here, right?
'Cause...otherwise, she's gonna kill me.
Okay, Keisha. I'm gonna lower a mask to you, and I need you to put it on. Can you do that?
Okay, here it comes.
She's already showing signs of hypoxia, Cap.
We got to get her out of there before she has permanent neurological damage.
Okay. Eddie, I want you to extend the aerial ladder over the hole.
We'll lower Buck down. He'll pull her out.
Oh, wait. Why me?
I did say you could go next time.
Not the same, man.
That's good.
Nice and slow. Keep it coming.
Okay, about five more feet, Eddie.
Doing okay, Buck?
Well, I'm not looking forward to this next part.
All right, Keisha, let's get you out of here.
Keisha! She's drowning. She's gone under!
I can't see her! Get me down there now!
Eddie, drop him, drop him.
Wh-What's happening?
Keisha! Keisha. Keisha.
I got you.
You're okay. You're okay. I got her!
We'll get you out.
Okay. Guys, get us out of here!
Okay, bring 'em up.
I got her. I got her.
Sorry we couldn't find the five mil, babe.
I don't need the money.
I just need you.
So whatever you're waiting for, you don't have to wait anymore.
My answer is yes.
Uh, yes what?
Yes, I will marry you.
We can settle down and start a whole new adventure as a family.
Oh. Babe, uh...
I thought you knew.
I <i>am</i> married.
What?!
You're my adventure.
J-Just on the side.
Uh, she wanted some space.
Oof. Whew!
Come on.
Got a call from the alarm company about a break-in?
They called me, too.
Jeremiah. I was Mr. Harcourt's personal assistant.
The door was like that when I got here.
I haven't touched a thing. I figured it was probably some treasure hunters looking for clues.
Okay. Stay here.
Okay.
This is LAPD. The door's open. I'm coming in.
LAPD.
Get up slowly. Hands in the air.
What are you doing in my house?
Hollis Harcourt?
Looking mighty good for a dead man.
You're alive?
I'm gonna kill you!
Ah. I have not known this man for long, but I'm confident he's not worth it.
You're such an ass.
What happened to, "He had such a good soul"?
And who changed my alarm code? Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the person who's not supposed to be dead?
And who was conveniently left out of the will?
Speaking of that, Mr. Harcourt, I think you and I need to have a conversation about your unexpected return to the land of the living.
15 years of working for a solipsistic narcissist...Don't let the thesaurus hit you on the way out!
Sorry for dragging you over here for nothing, Sergeant, but as you can see, there's been no break-in. Just a simple misunderstanding.
I think your work here is done.
Or perhaps it's just beginning.
Fraud. Filing a false report.
Forging a death certificate. All crimes, Mr. Harcourt.
And you would be right to arrest me if I had done even one of those things.
But I didn't.
Simply had my lawyer have my publicist release a statement, and voilà.
Cue the heartfelt tributes and outpourings of emotion.
I'm feeling some kind of emotions myself right now.
And your ridiculous treasure hunt has the city completely off the rails.
Isn't it great?
Confirms everything I ever thought about this town.
Full of selfish, greedy morons.
Well, those morons are dropping like flies.
You need to call this whole thing off.
I can't.
I need to find out how it ends.
You buried it. Pretty sure you know how it ends.
Not the hunt.
The book.
<i>Gutted in Glendale.</i> It's my next novel.
I've been working on it for two years. Huge advance.
Already sold the movie rights.
Tom Hanks wants to star.
He loves these, uh, blood and treasure stories.
Mine is gonna be like <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i> only bigger.
Just one problem.
I don't know how it ends.
So you buried the treasure...
To find my ending.
I've blown the last three deadlines, and, uh, people have started asking some very uncomfortable questions.
Saying a lot of very ugly words, like...
"refund." Ugh. And "lawsuit." But I am so close. I can feel it.
I'm gonna find my ending. I just need a little more time.
So maybe you keep the news that I'm not dead between the two of us.
I could just sneak back out and...
The alarm call went out over the radio, so I'm probably gonna run into some curious reporters back at the station.
And what are you gonna tell them?
The truth.
<i>Wait.</i> We were his research?
More like his lab rats.
Running around in his little treasure hunt simulation.
Which is exactly what he wanted.
Every emergency on the news was a new chapter for his book.
The idea is surprisingly diabolical for Hollis Harcourt.
Have you ever read any of his books?
Well, if we were his research, we should all get paid.
He tell Athena where the treasure's at? No.
If there even <i>is</i> a treasure.
Hollis never had to actually plant one to get what he wanted.
He just needed to say that he did.
And since we now officially know that he's a liar...
It's time to give up. Right?
No more treasure hunt.
♪ <i>Take me to the docks</i>♪ ♪ <i>There is a ship without a name there, and it is...♪</i> <i>I can't believe I fell for it.</i> I feel like an idiot.
Come on, we, uh, we all got fooled.
Yeah, but I should've known better.
Mm.
I'm a trained journalist.
Or, at least, I was.
Before I got caught up in this dumb treasure hunt.
What was I thinking?
Think of it as a...a big adventure.
Uh...
But you got to sleep in your own bed every night.
Huh.
We were so close.
Yeah, we were.
And then that selfish, lazy bastard ruined everything.
Actually, that's not fair.
He wasn't completely lazy.
You know, he did like to jog.
But I can still hate him, right?
Right?
Hey.
You know, we could always rent a cabin now and then. For vacation.
Mm-hmm.
Do you even know how to fish?
I am from Minnesota.
Well, I take that as a yes.
Hmm.
"I walked along the river's edge "to hide my secret treasure.
"A heron soared, a gray bridge roared, a bullfrog croaked, 'Good measure.'" This is terrible.
No, it's awful.
He's not much of a poet. Or even a writer, I guess.
"I stopped beneath a willow tree "in the narrow place.
"And then I saw a light beam fall upon my treasured place." The narrow place.
I was never able to figure that part out. I searched his novels.
Couldn't find a reference.
Not sure what I missed.
You're missing a book.
Yeah, Hollis's unpublished book.
<i>Gutted in Glendale.</i> Hmm.
Hmm.
Bobby?
Yeah.
I think I know where the treasure is.
The Glendale Narrows. That's what they call this part of the river.
Wait. You mean this concrete channel with water in it?
I keep telling everybody, this is not a river.
Which is exactly why no one else ever thought of it.
All of you adventurers thinking you had to trek up into the mountains.
Never occurred to you to look right here in the city.
Home of herons.
And bullfrogs.
And a gray bridge roaring. Right there.
Bit on the nose for a metaphor.
Well, Hollis isn't really a poet. Or a trustworthy person.
He's not the only one.
Uh, seriously?
Well, so much for giving up.
I cannot believe you guys. We agreed we'd all stop looking.
And yet here we all are.
Did you two really bring your gear?
Wasn't sure what the terrain would be like. Wanted to be ready.
Hey. They brought their med kits.
This treasure hunt has been nothing but medical rescues and injuries.
I was not about to be one of them.
So, what tipped it off for you guys?
Hollis's yet-to-be-released novel, <i>Gutted in Glendale.</i> And then the part in the poem about a narrow place.
Put it together...
Glendale Narrows.
It was the river for us.
Uh, Taylor said Hollis used to jog here.
My wife wrote an algorithm that detects changes in satellite images.
Okay, well, what do we do now?
Six of us, one treasure.
Technically, Bobby and I pulled up first.
Whoa. Because you elected to keep the name of Hollis's unpublished novel to yourself.
I didn't know it was important.
Also, pretty sure this is the first time any of us are hearing about an algorithm.
Okay, guys, look, it's $5 million.
So we split it five ways.
Seven.
We have a preexisting deal with Taylor and her...cameraman.
The cameraman with no name gets a cut?
No, no, no. I really don't think that anyone who isn't physically here should get a cut.
Uh, sh-she already knew where we were going.
Okay, fine, look, we-we split it seven ways. I don't know the exact math, but that's enough.
Uh, it's, uh, $714,285.
71.4 cents.
I don't know what to do with the point-four.
You-you can keep ours.
We found the treasure.
So let's go enjoy it. Together. Come on.
It's got to be buried on one of those little islands, the sandbars.
I see some willow trees.
But how will we know which one it is?
There's supposed to be a marker.
"H" marks the spot.
Or maybe we'll find someone else already there, beating us to it.
Is that Probie?
Guys!
I found it!
What's five million divided by eight?
I'm not doing any more math.
Ravi, why don't you do the honors since you were here first?
Pretty sure we would've been here first were it not for the extended round of negotiations.
Wasn't as heavy as I thought.
I'm guessing it's just a check, not the actual jewels.
I mean, who would be dumb enough to do that? Right?
You have got to be kidding me.
What? I think we need to have a word with Mr. Harcourt.
Gate's already open.
Never a good sign.
Front door is open, too.
I'm gonna go in and check it out.
You all wait here.
You are not going in there alone.
We're going in with you, Athena.
Do any of you have a badge?
And a gun?
I didn't think so.
Wait here.
Guess he found his ending.
Oh, my God.
Is he...
dead?
Most likely murdered.
Didn't I say to wait outside?
Why do you people never listen?
So that we could be your alibi?
<i>This is News 8 with breaking news.</i> This is Taylor Kelly reporting from outside Hollis Harcourt's mansion, where, in a twist worthy of one of his novels, the famed author has been found dead.
Again.
So, you all found an empty treasure chest, drove down here like an angry mob to confront him, now he's dead.
But these facts are unrelated to each other?
Rick, he was dead when we got here.
We didn't kill him.
We just wanted to.
Buck.
You're new.
Yeah.
I'm not really with them.
Uh, I barely know these people, so...
Detective.
Yeah.
We got the security footage.
Wasn't them.
I didn't actually think it was.
I was just...
I was just doing my job.
Mm-hmm.
And maybe enjoying the moment a little.
Take a look at this.
She's wearing a Zip Parcel uniform, but that is not one of their trucks.
Delivery driver?
This time of night?
Is she pregnant?
She is.
Where have I seen her before?
My husband almost died! More people are gonna die!
And you knew he had to be stopped, so maybe you took matters into your own hands.
I didn't kill him.
Yeah.
Been hearing that a lot tonight.
But you went there in disguise, under false pretenses.
Doesn't look good.
He was a horrible person.
But you didn't kill him?
You're not really delivering anything.
Where did you get the outfit?
From my husband.
My sweet, kind, normally level-headed husband.
Who almost lost his life because of your ridiculous treasure hunt.
If you're surprised that your husband is a greedy, reckless man, then maybe the truth is you didn't know him as well as you thought.
So...you're welcome.
He's not greedy.
He wanted the money for his family.
We have a baby on the way, and now he can't work.
He might not be able to do his job ever again thanks to you.
And?
You need to fix this.
Make it right.
Oh, oh, I see. Okay, this is a-a shakedown.
Got it. Um, who should I make the check out to?
How about, uh, "Mrs. Take Your Sob Story And Empty Envelope Somewhere Else"?
Because I don't care.
Don't you touch me!
No! Oh!
Oh, my God.
That's a -- that's a crystal vase!
It's valuable!
So's my husband!
Not to me.
Stop it!
What are you doing?!
Stop it! What are you do...
I'm calling the...
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i> <i>-This is 911. Is anyone there?</i> <i>Hello? Can you hear me? Is anyone there?</i> <i>Hello?</i> Help.
<i>If you're there, press a button.</i> Why didn't you say anything?
You don't know that.
Maybe it was just a bad connection.
She's not wrong.
She didn't technically kill him.
The M. E. talked to his doctors.
He had a heart condition.
Hollis let her into the house.
So, no breaking and entering charges.
She just let him die.
And the D. A. isn't gonna want to touch this with a ten-foot pole.
Everyone just wants this whole thing to go away.
I know I do.
But what do you think happened to the money?
Buck, there was no money.
Hollis was just yanking everyone's chain.
The whole city.
And all of us.
But why bury an empty chest?
I mean, why bury anything at all?
You don't think the probie double-crossed us, do you?
At this point, I don't trust anyone.
I mean, aside from you guys, obviously.
Everyone else, they suck. Huh.
Especially that assistant.
Jeremiah. You know, he swore to me he'd seen the treasure with his own eyes.
Guess he was in on the con this whole time.
No. He was just as surprised as I was that Hollis was alive.
You're alive?
I'm gonna kill you!
Uh...
What are you thinking?
Hollis didn't bury an empty chest.
Hollis didn't bury anything.
<i>Hollis wasn't the type to get his hands dirty.</i> You're the only one I trust.
You have to do this for me.
You just told me you're dying, and now you want me to wade into the L. A. River and bury $5 million?
I need a minute.
Jeremiah, I don't think I have many minutes left.

He had a fake will for his fake death?
And still didn't put his assistant in it?
That guy was a real piece of work.

Full of selfish, greedy morons.

Chartered a plane to the Maldives.
No extradition treaty.
Do we even know if he committed a crime?
Yeah. What else would you call it?
A severance package.
Yeah.
But I really think...
Okay.
Yeah, forget I asked.
I'm guessing no trip to the Maldives?
They think "there was never a treasure" is a better story.
They want me to leave it there.
Ah. I feel like they don't know you very well.
Mm. And you think you do?
You know, I'm starting to.
I also happen to think that, me and you, we, uh...
we make a pretty good team.
Buck, we didn't find the treasure and you ended up being questioned by the police.
For the second time.
Yeah, but, uh, the rest of it...
It was fun.
I'm glad we're friends.
Friends.
Great.
 @@@@@@
All you got to do is hang on.
Push through the pain.
"911," all-new Mondays.
And watch other Fox shows like "Lone Star," "Prodigal Son," and "The Resident" on Fox.
I swear, I already told you everything I know.
Let's begin by getting a baseline.
Is your name Nora Perez?
You know it is.
Damn it! Yes or no?
Yes.
Is today Saturday?
Yes.
Then tell me, was it you who divulged my secret information?
For the thousandth time, no.
Not now, Mom.
Sorry to interrupt, sweetie, but makeup's ready for Nora.
But I haven't found the snitch yet.
It's okay, honey.
I know you've been trying your best, and that's all that matters.

You sent us to a nutritionist.
I was concerned about your health.
You told her to make sure none of us were thinner than you today.
You sound like you're holding a grudge.
Are you the one that's going online and trashing me? Sweetheart, the wedding's in two hours.

Chim, how's our bride doing?
Just a second.
What-what happened?
You experienced an electrical shock and passed out.
Is this a polygraph machine?
Um, yeah.
Is it, is it still working?
Maybe if you're looking to grill something.
I thought you were getting ready for a wedding.
Is this some kind of reality show?
Got a nasty exit wound on the sole of her foot from the electricity.
She probably absorbed at least 1,800 watts.
Bethany's just a little nervous about her big day, wanting everything to be just right.
She thinks one of us is a saboteur, mocking her online, anonymously.
One of you is. And I am gonna find out who "Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent" is before I walk down the aisle. The only place you should be walking is into an ER.
There's no telling what that current did to you internally.
So we're gonna need to take you to the hospital for an ECG.
Unacceptable.
Ma'am, no. No, ma'am...
Because I...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ma'am, please take it easy.
I'm getting married in less than two hours.
How's my makeup?
Uh, well, I think they can probably fix that.
Right.
Right, 'cause we can just paint a new eyebrow on, right?
Yeah, I-I mean, I-I saw this makeup thing online, and this woman made her face look like a skull.
It was cool.
We'll just do a photo shoot after our honeymoon.
Yeah. Today, you have the veil.
Right. So the only thing left to address is the snitch. Sweetie.
Can't we just let it go and celebrate the happiest day of our lives?
My life. My day.
And I'm not going down the aisle when there is a traitor in my midst.
It was me.
I'm Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent.
I'm Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent.
Um, I-I'm Trapped_By Bridezill_- One-hundred-percent.
Damn it! We're not doing <i>Spartacus!</i> I actually am Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent, because have I been in hell this last year with you.
Betrayer!
I always suspected we were too lenient with you, Bethany, that we spoiled you too much, but dear God, you're a monster.
That's it!
You are officially excommunicated from the wedding.
But I'm paying for it!
Well, the check's already cleared.
So I want you gone.
All of you! Get out!
All I need are new eyebrows and my dress.
Yeah, about that...
Sorry.
Good luck with the wedding.
A seven-year-old boy presents with persistent cough, low-grade fever and runny nose.
His parents tell you that he hasn't had immunization since he was about four years old, and that he vomits after prolonged coughing spells.
What is your diagnosis?
Well, first I'd listen to his lungs.
And depending on that, I would need his BP...
<i>Eh.</i> Time's up.
Pertussis, better known as whooping cough.
Treatment is macrolide antibiotics for bacterial infection.
Don't "eh" me. I was getting there, eventually.
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.
Hi. Hey, Ma.
You going out?
Picking up some groceries.
Karen called, told me about that farmers market over by the park.
Did she say how it's going over at her brother's?
Is Denny having a good time?
Karen said they're running around like a pack of wild animals after a yearlong hibernation.
Maybe I'll bring you guys back a treat.
Cookies always did the trick when you were studying as a kid.
They still do for me.
Gotcha.
Ah!
Oh!
Ma. You okay?
Damn back acting up again.
Ma, you look like you're sweating.
Do you got a fever?
Oh, honey, just because you're studying to be a doctor doesn't mean I'm interested in being a patient.
I will pop a couple of ibuprofen, it'll pass.
You sure?
Good luck with your studying.
Okay. What's the next question?
Popcorn bucket.
Screen.
Movie. Movie theater, movie theater.
Oh, come on.
Ding, ding, a movie theater.
How did you get "movie theater" from that?
You two must have some kind of sibling shorthand.
No, it's called cheating.
Okay? Uh -- Listen, you know, where's Bobby? I need my partner.
I'm not sure where he is. He should have been home by now.
Just said he was having lunch with someone from work.
And I thought I was your partner.
Oh, baby, I-I just usually play with Bobby, that's all.
Oh, it's for your own safety, trust me.
Bobby is the only one who can deal with Michael's competitive streak.
You'll thank me later.
Oh, there he is. Hey.
Hey.
Bobby!
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Lunch went long.
Bobby!
Oh, that's okay. We were just doing a couple of practice rounds till you got here.
You ready to kick some butt, partner?
I am, I just got to get these clothes off -- I've been racing around -- take a shower, and then I'll join you guys.
A shower?
Yeah, it'll just be a minute.
Wheatgrass is Mother Nature's green elixir.
It can cure just about anything.
Even helps people lose weight.
I believe it.
I'm pretty sure I'd lose my appetite after a shot of this.
Everything you see here is vegan, non-GMO, free from wheat, gluten, dairy, egg and soy.
So what's it made out of? Air?
Finally. Food I recognize.
And a smell I wish I didn't.
Don't be scared off by the smell; the taste is incredible.
Savory, sweet and creamy all at once.
It's a culinary adventure.
I think I'm looking more for a culinary walk around the block.
You know, maybe some grapes, a couple of oranges.
We have Jaffa oranges, Cara Cara navel, blood orange.
Were you looking for anything in particular?
Are you okay?
Ma'am? Ma'am, are you okay?
Someone call 911!
Ma.
Are you okay?
Hi, baby. I'm okay.
Just a little banged up.
What happened? Your mother experienced a freak syncopal episode, possibly vasovagal.
A what?
You got dizzy because your heart rate and blood pressure suddenly dropped.
Did she mention she was also experiencing back pains earlier?
Her chart shows back surgery following a car accident in 2004.
I thought she might have been running a fever earlier.
Henrietta, I'm fine.
Mom, you're in the emergency room.
Clearly you're not fine.
Uh, her temperature was normal upon admittance.
I mean, this could also be dehydration, or maybe an allergy to something at the farmers market.
Or sometimes people just faint.
That's...That's it? You...
"People just faint"?
Did you do an-an echo?
An echo isn't indicated.
She should talk to her primary care physician about adjusting her blood pressure medication.
Maybe think about making some adjustments to her diet.
Could help to lose weight.
And, uh, maybe stay off WebMD.
Your mother's fine.
He was useless.
A complete waste of a doctor's coat.
Which is why I never go.
Uh...Yeah.
What do you think? That's better, right?
I think it looks exactly the same?
I just want everything to be perfect.
It's been over a year.
It's gonna be awesome.
Coming!
Okay.
Carla!
Hey!
Hey...
Hey!
Hey.
Oh, I missed my boys.
Oh...
Oh, I missed you.
I missed you.
Yeah?
Oh.
I'm sure your teacher was thrilled.
Oh, no, no, let me get those.
Oh, please.
You prepared a lovely meal. I can help Eddie clean up.
You can't go in the kitchen.
Oh. Oh, that's right.
Mm-hmm.
We have some business to take care of.
We do, don't we?
Okay.
It is so good to have you back. We missed you.
I'm sorry about your father.
Me, too.
I'm just grateful I was able to spend that time with him.
Mm.
Still...
I know I left you in the lurch, and I'm sorry for that.
Oh, no, no, no.
You were where you were supposed to be.
I'm glad you had that time, too.
Mm.
Christopher seems good.
I know you were worried about him.
Yeah, he's doing a lot better.
Mm.
Almost back to his old happy self.
And he loves having Ana around.
What about Dad?
How does he feel about the young Ms. Flores?
It's nice.
It's, uh...
easy being with her.
Ana is lovely.
And I'm glad that you're finally moving on.
But just be sure that you're following your heart, not Christopher's, okay?
Surprise!
Happy birthday, Carla.
But my birthday's in March.
And we missed it twice.
You got me two cakes.
Light the candles, Dad.
Okay, this is a disturbing number of candles.
Thank goodness there's a firefighter in the house.
Thank you, honey.
You okay?
That's the third cup you've had in the last hour.
Not that I'm counting. More of a guestimate.
I didn't know it was humanly possible to feel this tired.
So Jee's still not sleeping through the night?
No, that would mean she would have to stop crying long enough to actually sleep.
The doctor says that it's colic, but I don't know.
It's...it's the way she cries.
No matter what I try, nothing calms her.
Well, what about you?
Are you doing anything to soothe yourself?
I'm just doing my job.
911. What's your emergency?
<i>My mom, she fell, and now she's stuck.</i> <i>Can you send help to get her out?</i> What's your location? <i>-We're at home.</i> <i>The Regal Pointe Apartments.</i> Okay, help is on the way. What's your name?
Charlie. <i>-Charlie, can you tell me if your mom is hurt?</i> Help!
I don't know. I'm not supposed to go out there. I'm sick.
<i>It's okay. You did the right thing by calling.</i> <i>Where exactly is she stuck?</i> The balcony.
She fell through the floor.
It's like it swallowed her up.
Help!
Help!
All right, Buck, get up there. I'll be right behind you.
Okay.
BOBBY Ma'am, this is the LAFD.
We're on our way up to you now.
Just, uh, hang on tight.
Oh, uh, hi-hi there.
Sir, can-can we use your balcony for a few minutes?
It's, uh, to help her.
Sheila?
Hi, Clarence.
Come on in.
I'm gonna cook inside.
All right. LAFD, ma'am.
We'll get you out of there.
Okay, Eddie, it's your turn. Head on up.
Hey.
How you doing?
I know I put on a few quarantine pounds, but I didn't think it was this bad.
Well, from the looks of you, I don't think you have anything to worry about.
But you are stuck in there pretty good.
I'm gonna put this rescue strap around you, secure you to that ladder, so if the rest of this balcony goes, you stay up here with me. Sound good?
Sounds great.
But also a thing I didn't know to be afraid of until right now.
No need to be afraid. I got you.
Okay.
All right, guys, keep sending up the ladder.
It's okay, sweetie.
Don't worry.
Your son?
Yeah.
Who would've guessed the worst part about being a single mom is having nobody to pull you out of the balcony after you've crashed through it?
The wood looks completely rotted.
Probably water damage or termites.
It's a good thing he wasn't out here.
Figures. This place is practically falling down around us.
I can't afford to do repairs, and my landlord never fixes anything.
Maybe a visit from the fire department might change his attitude.
How we looking down there, guys?
Okay, we shored up the balcony as best we could.
We got a platform underneath in case she falls.
You're not gonna fall.
I just have to leave for a minute.
I got to go let our paramedics in the door.
Okay.
You must be Charlie the hero.
I didn't do anything.
You did exactly what you're supposed to, you called 911.
That was quick thinking of you. You really helped out your mom.
Vitals are good. BP's 120/80.
Copy that. She definitely cut her leg, Cap.
I saw some blood dripping.
We can't access her till we pull it out.
Okay, let's pry away those rotted wooden slats, make a bigger opening, then we lift her up and out.
Buck, Eddie, get yourself on safety lines before you head out there, in case this whole thing goes.
Okay, should be enough of a gap around to pull her out now.
Sheila, put your arms around my neck and hold on.
I'll pull you up.
I got you.
All right, let's get her on the board.
It hurts. Looks pretty bad.
The wood really tore her leg up.
She's gonna need stitches.
I can't go to the hospital.
Ma'am, a doctor needs to clean this and sew it up so it can heal properly, not to mention a tetanus shot.
No, but Charlie.
Oh, he can ride with you to the hospital.
We've got plenty of room.
He has an autoimmune disease, and the hospital is the worst place for a sick child.
All those germs.
And I don't really have anyone to stay with him.
I'll stay. I have a kid around Charlie's age.
We'll get along fine.
No, that's -- I can't ask you to do that.
You didn't ask. I offered.
No, no, I can't leave him. Please.
Hey, Charlie.
Want to help me out with the ropes, kid?
<i>Bourbon.</i> <i>His shirt reeked of it.</i> Yeah, but Bobby hasn't had a drink in years, has he?
Not that I know.
But he's been acting strange, distant.
Put that together with a bourbon-soaked shirt, and I don't know what to think.
Except maybe he's drinking again.
Well, have you talked to him, Athena?
Oh, not yet.
I'm not even sure what to say.
Every question sounds like an accusation.
I can see that you're worried, but I got to say none of this sounds like the Bobby I know.
The problem is, there's a Bobby I never met.
The one who lost everything because he lost control.
Yeah, but he isn't that man anymore.
He thinks he could be.
A few months back, the drunk driver who caused the pileup on the 710 -- Bobby told me there was only one difference one bad day.
What if he's had that one bad day?
Hmm.
<i>You're lucky.</i> My mom's a terrible cook, but your dad's great.
<i>Did he order take-out?</i> <i>I was thinking the same thing.</i> Hey, watch it, I'm right here.
Oh, shoot.
No worries.
I got it.
Uh, where does your mom keep the paper towels?
Upper cabinet.
<i>Charlie, what school do you go to?</i> I don't go to school.
Because I'm sick. We move around a lot.
I'm not supposed to go out, except for doctors' appointments.
<i>What kind of doctors?</i> I don't know, all kinds.
We're always going to see a new one.
Whew. Sounds expensive.
What's your mom do for work?
She always says her job is to take care of me.
We're lucky because we get donations from a Fund Me page.
Ah.
I'm home.
Hey.
Look who's back.
And all patched up.
Hi, Mom.
You cooked for him.
Charlie has a very sensitive stomach.
Figured you'd be a little wobbly when you got back.
Just wanted to make it easier for you.
Don't worry, Mom, I don't feel sick or anything.
That's great, sweetheart.
Oh, this is my new friend Christopher.
<i>Hi, Charlie's mom.</i> <i>Bye, Charlie's mom.</i> <i>-Bye, Charlie. Bye, Dad.</i> Bye, guys.
He's super cool.
Do you think we could hang out sometime?
We'll have to see.
No, Mom, I'm not nagging you, I'm-I'm just checking on you.
Okay, great.
Well, maybe you should...
And she hung up on me.
Take it as a positive sign.
Must mean she's feeling better.
So how are you doing?
Fine.
I'm still a little freaked out not knowing what's wrong with my mom.
Well, maybe you should take her to see a specialist.
I would, but I need to have some idea of what's wrong first.
And that doctor was no help.
He practically dismissed us.
Eh, you know how crazy it can get in the ER.
Not that I'm not defending him, I'm just saying.
He barely acknowledged we were in the room, Chim.
And when I asked questions, he acted as if I offended him.
Like, "How dare you?" I mean, I hate to think it, but maybe our experience would have been different if he had looked more like us.
I was a 12-year-old Korean boy translating to the doctor on behalf of my sick mother.
Makes you wonder how bad it is for a patient who doesn't have anyone, no one to advocate for them.
That's why people like you and me can't put all our trust in doctors.
Because they don't trust us.
To know how we're feeling, to-to know when something's wrong.
I know something's wrong, Chim.
What you need are some brilliant medical minds to bounce ideas off of.
You know any of those?
I'm pretty sure you do.
This is what we call the index of suspicion, where we assess how seriously a condition should be considered as a diagnosis.
Henrietta.
Mom, please. Just humor me.
Okay.
Do your worst.
62-year-old female presents with dizziness and intermittent back pain.
Patient has a history of high blood pressure and smoking.
I haven't had a cigarette since before Henrietta was born.
Still goes in the history.
BP's normal, heart rate's a little elevated, but that could be stress.
Okay, so why would she be stressed?
Maybe because you keep referring to me as "she." What about kidney failure? Could explain the back pain.
It would've shown up in the blood labs from the hospital.
One of the few tests they did take.
Could be an inner ear problem, like, uh, Ménière's disease.
Would explain the loss of balance and dizziness.
Ma, can you hear me?
Of course I can hear you.
Okay, here's a crazy thought. Huntington's disease?
I hadn't considered that. Mrs. Wilson, are you experiencing any other loss of motor function?
I did my nails this morning.
I think they look pretty good.
Has she been around ticks?
We haven't thought about Lyme disease, have we?
Lupus? Multiple sclerosis?
Iron deficiency? Anemia?
Cross that off the list.
No, her limbs aren't stiff. Scratch that.
Take that off the list. Nah, we checked that.
I think we've exhausted our options.
I told you I was fine.
But I do appreciate your diligence.
M-Mom?
Ma.
She's burning up.
Her heart is racing.
Picking up a pulsating sensation around her navel.
It's definitely cardiac.
Her abdominal aorta?
A triple A?
An abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Ma, we got to get you to the hospital.
Wai -- You think it ruptured? I mean, if it did, she...
She's gonna die.
I'm home!
Maddie?
Oh. Good, you're back.
Oh, come here, sweet baby.
How was your day?
Fine, except for the nonstop crying.
That's okay.
♪ <i>Strong men also cry.</i> ♪ Don't they, Jee-Yun?
Are you okay? Something else going on?
It's the way she cries, like she's in pain.
All the time, and I just don't know how to help her.
Oh, it's just the colic.
I wish there was more we could do to soothe her, but...
Ugh, God, why is everyone so damn focused on being soothed right now?
I'm sorry.
To both of you.
There you go.
That's better, huh?
You're really good with her.
So are you. You've been doing great.
You know what? I have not had a minute to myself all day.
So, you good with her while I hop in the shower?
No place I'd rather be.
Right? Huh, baby Jee?
Miss Daddy?
Yeah, he missed you, too. Okay.
Just need to borrow this.
Okay, all right. Just right here. Ma, get in.
Uh, can I help you? Go. I got this.
Yes, you can. I was actually thinking of having surgery at this hospital, but I kind of want to vet it first.
Vet the hospital?
Uh, yes, and I have a few questions.
Uh, so this might take a few minutes.
Why don't you write this down?
Can I help you? I have a patient.
Female, 62 years old.
She's experiencing dizziness, back pain, and orthostatic hypotension.
Could be looking at abdominal aortic aneurysm.
We need an electrocardiogram to verify, stat.
Uh...Hello?
You heard her.
Uh, of course.
I'll get someone right away.
Echo and EKG show severe deterioration of the abdominal aorta.
Imaging shows that a rupture was imminent.
They're prepping her for surgery now.
So, she's okay?
They should be able to graft the artery, yeah.
The surgical team will be by in a few minutes, go over the procedure with you, answer any questions you may have.
Hopefully more thoroughly than you were the other day.
I beg your pardon?
She could have died if I hadn't brought her back in.
You sent us home with-with no explanation, no diagnosis and barely any treatment.
Look, I am sorry that I missed it.
But the important thing is that we caught it in time...and your mother is gonna be fine.
"We"?
You know, when I'm out in the field on a call, I have a split second to diagnose a patient, if I'm lucky.
I-I can't run blood, do an X-ray or-or order an echo.
All I have is what I know, and my ability to listen to what the patient is saying.
Even with every tool a-at your disposal, you still got it wrong.
Okay, what-what would you have had me do differently?
Believe them when they tell you that something is wrong.
Start there.
Oh.
Carla.
Uh, here you go.
Does he like video games?
I have some old ones I don't play anymore.
You know what, I'm not sure. I didn't see a television when I was there.
You know, let's just stick to books and toys.
No TV?
He really does need our help.
Just remember that help doesn't always come in the form of screen time.
Uh-huh.
Wow, someone's feeling generous.
Hey, Eddie.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
Now, don't let him give away the whole house while I'm gone.
CARLA Okay.
What's going on?
I was thinking about what you said, how that family supports themselves through their Fund Me page, so I started looking around...
You went snooping?
I was trying to make a donation.
Maybe circulate it on the faculty newsletter.
But I think there's something wrong with this woman.
That feels like a leap.
You haven't even met her.
No, but I found some weird stuff online.
I think she lied to you.
About what?
<i>That's a lot of Fund Me pages.</i> There's Sheila and Charlie Burns in El Paso, Sheila and Charlie Young in Phoenix, and Sheila and Charlie Watts of Santa Fe.
It's him, the same kid every time, just with different last names and different cities.
Charlie did say they moved around a lot.
That would explain the different accounts and different cities, but not the different names.
What did his mom say his illness was?
She didn't. Not really.
Said it was autoimmune.
Well, that's awfully general.
Charlie did say he goes to a lot of different doctors.
Could be doctor shopping.
Which is what you do when you're not really sick, you're just looking for a doctor to say that you are.
You think she's lying?
Well, we wouldn't be the only ones.
Most of the Fund Me pages were shut down, but the comments are still up.
"This woman is a fraud and a scammer.
Do not trust her." "She's a con artist looking for money and attention." Oh, God. What?
"I think she's making her kid sick." Oh, you didn't have to do dishes.
You cooked.
Well, that's okay.
What do you say, you want to watch a movie?
May is out and Harry's at Michael's.
We could have a date night in.
Um, rain check?
I just had a really long day, I think I got to crash.
Hmm. Is everything okay?
I mean, if something's bothering you, if something's on your mind, you know you can talk to me.
Everything is fine.
Nothing to talk about.
It doesn't feel fine.
I'm worried about you.
Athena, I'm...
I know you have your meetings, and I'm glad you have people that you can talk to.
But you can talk to me, too.
Yeah, I know, it's -- the meetings...not the same.
Yeah, I know.
I can never really understand that part of your life, but I'd like to try.
Maybe I can go with you to your meeting?
You have one tomorrow, right?
That is very sweet of you, but no.
I-I don't have one tomorrow, but you could come on Saturday.
Great.
Good, okay. Good night.
I'm fine, Karen. You, you stay there.
I'll call you when I have an update.
You're still here?
You didn't, you didn't have to.
It's your mom.
Thank you.
For everything.
Hen.
Ms. Wilson?
Good news.
Hey, Ma. How you feeling?
A little sore...but a lot grateful.
The surgeon did a good job.
You're gonna make a full recovery, Ma.
I'm glad to hear that.
But it's not the doctor I'm grateful for.
You saved my life.
Well, the truth is, I got used to having you around.
So I'm not ready to let you go just yet.
I won't be around forever, Henrietta.
Ma...
I won't.
So let me say this.
I am so proud of you.
Henrietta, you...working so hard and going to school, taking care of your family.
I know it's a struggle.
But it is worth it.
Because people like me?
We need doctors like you.
So, promise me...no matter how hard it gets, you won't give up.
You promise?
I promise.
Guess B shift's still out on a call.
Damn.
You're early. Couldn't sleep.
You remember the mom the other day? Sheila?
With the sick kid? Yeah.
He's not sick. Not really.
She's making him sick. Probably for years.
Munchausen by proxy? That's a big accusation, Eddie.
I tracked down some people that knew them before.
All signs point to it.
The nonspecific autoimmune disease, the revolving door of doctors.
He's frail, he's weak, he's always throwing up.
She's poisoning him.
Poisoning him? W-With what?
Eye drops. I saw them in the kitchen.
Eye drops. Tetrahydrozoline could cause the symptoms that you're talking about.
It can be lethal if it's ingested, doesn't show up on a standard toxicology test.
You have to know to look for it to find it.
She's dosing him.
Not enough to kill him but enough to keep him sick.
I called social services.
They're coming here to take a report.
Why-why would she do that?
Well, sometimes it's to gain sympathy.
Oh, or maybe to make a profit.
I found multiple Fund Me pages.
She's conning people out of their money.
Hello? <i>Eddie?</i> Charlie? You okay?
I think I did a bad thing.
Athena, come on. You-you followed him?
Not my finest hour, but I needed to know where he was going.
Okay, and?
He went to a meeting.
<i>Now, that's a great thing. Right?</i> Except he lied to me about it.
<i>So you still think that he's hiding something.</i> Maybe not a what.
Maybe a who.
Got to go. Talk later.
Buckley, you get promoted to captain when I wasn't looking?
Only vehicle available.
Diaz, you called this in?
Yeah. Possible O. D.
She's over here. I-I don't think she's breathing.
We're here now, we got her.
Do we know what she took?
Yeah, uh, Eddie thinks it's tetrahydrozoline poisoning.
Uh, eye drops.
She always puts drops in my food.
She thinks I don't see her, but I do.
I just wanted to see what would happen if I gave them to her.
I-I'm sorry.
Oh, no, that's okay, that's okay.
You didn't mean to hurt her.
Yeah, the kid's gonna need treatment, too.
Same kind of poisoning, just smaller doses.
But for a really long time.
<i>-o she was hurting her own kid?
S</i> <i>CHIMNEY Yeah, for money or attention</i> <i>or something hat doesn't really even matter. t</i> My God. That's terrible.
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad she fell through that balcony floor.
At least that kid will be safe, far away from her.
Yeah. Sounds like he's better off without her.
<i>Yeah, I guess some people ust aren't meant to be parents. j</i> <i>Anyway, kind of made me want to hear your voice,</i> tell you guys how much I love you.
<i>You're sweet.</i> How are things there? I don't hear Jee-Yun crying.
<i>That seems like a good sign.</i> She's finally asleep.
<i>Well, that's a relief.
ey, listen, Hen just showed up, H</i> <i>and I want to hear about her mom.</i> <i>Can I call you later?</i> Yeah.
Yeah, we're good here. There's nothing to worry about.
You followed me to a meeting?
You lied to me.
I couldn't understand why, and then I saw her.
That's Rachel Hawkerson, the drunk driver from the pileup.
Are you sponsoring her?
Look, I am trying to help her.
She's having a hard time finding somebody to talk to who can actually relate to what she went through.
The other night, when you came home smelling like bourbon?
That was Rachel's.
She fell off the wagon and called me, she was still drinking when I got there, and the bottle spilled on me when I tried to take it away from her.
You gonna have to help me out here, Bobby.
Why didn't you just tell me what was going on?
Because it's not my story to tell.
I didn't want to violate her confidentiality.
Oh, you can tell me what you're doing without telling me who.
All the sneaking around, leaving me in the dark.
Why shut me out? I'm your wife.
Yeah. It's hard when your spouse keeps things from you.
Trust me, I know.
Wait.
Is this supposed to be some kind of punishment?
You mean you're keeping this secret on purpose to get back at me?
No!
I don't know.
I decided to help somebody and I didn't think I needed to tell you about it.
You don't let me in on half the decisions you make.
Like what?
You decided to go back to work without talking to me about it, just like you stopped seeing Dr. Sanford without mentioning it to me, and then it turns out you were offered retirement and you dismiss it, and I'm kept completely in the dark about it.
I didn't think I needed to ask you for your permission.
You don't. This is about me not even being a factor or a consideration.
You don't -- It doesn't cross your mind to include me in the conversation or wonder what I might think.
We're supposed to be partners, but the truth is, you don't want one, at work or in your life.
I'm used to doing things on my own. That's who I am, and you knew that when you married me.
Well, I thought that, eventually, you would start to trust me more, but now I'm starting to think that you're just gonna always keep this wall up and I'm always gonna feel like an outsider looking in.
Well, maybe you wouldn't feel like an outsider if you talked to me instead of playing this tit-for-tat game.
Marriage isn't supposed to work like that.
Well, who said this marriage is working?
We're not partners because that's how you want it.
What about my mom?
Will I see her at the hospital? She's a little more sick.
She's got to go to a different hospital.
This is your ride.
My-my baby!
Where's my baby?
Where's my baby...
Should've gotten here sooner.
That kid is just lucky he met you.
Diaz, you want to ride with the kid to the hospital?
Yeah. That'd be gr...
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired. A firefighter is down.
I repeat, firefighter is down!
Shots fired. Shots fired.
 @@@@@@
<i>Shots fired. Shots fired!</i>
<i>Firefighter's been shot!</i> Shots fired!
Get down!
We need LAPD and air support!
Firefighter needs help!
Come on, Eddie!
Stay down! I'm gonna come! I got you!
Stay down!
Shots fired. Firefighter needs help!
Eddie, hang on. Eddie...
Firefighter needs help. I repeat...
I got...
Aah!
Get him in the cabin!
Come on.
Get him in the cabin!
Get to the trucks!
Go! Go, go, go, go!
Hey, come on!
Back up! Back up, back up, back up!
Here, we got you. We got you. Hey, hey.
I got you. Okay.
This is the captain of the 133 en route to Byrne Memorial.
Hey, just...you just stay with me, okay?
Requesting a trauma unit to meet us.
Hey...are you hurt?
We have a firefighter with a gunshot wound.
Firefighter Eddie Diaz
No, no, no. I'm good.
of the 118.
You just hang on.
Hey, come on! Come on!
Just hang on.
Hey, three minutes away. You're so close.
We're gonna need a lot of blood.
We're so close, I just...I need you to hang...I need you to hang on.
Where are you going?
To work. I'm late.
Absolutely not. You don't get to announce our marriage isn't working and then just walk away, Bobby.
Hen, what's up? I'm on my way.
<i>Cap, it's Eddie. He's been shot.</i> <i>They're transporting him now.</i>
What hospital?
Come on! Come on, come on!
Through-and-through. Upper torso. Copy that.
Large caliber.
We've got a transfusion ready.
Did you say large caliber?
It was a sniper.
Pulse is weak.
Trauma Bay Two. Let's set up for a thoracotomy.
You okay, Buckley?
No.
Right this way.
Appreciate it.
Detective Denvers?
Sergeant Athena Grant. Heard about the shooting.
Thought I'd stop by, see if I could help.
And why would an off-duty sergeant be interested in my crime scene?
My husband's truck.
He's captain of the 118.
Injured man was one of his.
What do you know about the wounded firefighter?
Someone said he was ex-military.
Eddie. You think he was the intended victim?
He was the first one shot.
By someone who's apparently a very well-trained sniper.
Feels like there could be a connection. Detective Denvers.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Uh, Sergeant.
Looks like we're gonna need that expertise of yours.
Buck.
Uh, no-no comment, Taylor.
That's not why I'm here. Really.
I'm not working this one.
I just heard a firefighter was shot.
You didn't answer my calls.
I got worried.
Sorry. I...I-I wasn't checking my phone.
Is that blood?
Oh, it's, um, it's not mine, it's Eddie's.
Eddie's the one who got shot?
He was standing right in front of me.
And then, um...um...
I need to talk to Christopher.
Yeah.
I-I don't...I don't have my car.
I need to call a ride.
Why don't I drive you?
We can stop by your pla...
Uh, no. No, I-I got...
You can't go see his son looking like this.
Are you sure you're okay?
<i>Uh, he's pretty shaken up,</i> but otherwise fine. <i>Thank God.</i>
When Buck didn't answer, I thought...
I think he's just in shock.
<i>Yeah. Just another trauma</i> to add to the pile.
<i>We have an update now on an earlier story.</i>
How is Eddie doing?
He's gonna be in surgery for the next few hours, so we won't know anything for a while.
<i>Buck's heading over to Eddie's place to, uh,</i> <i>check in on Christopher.</i>
Hey, Chim, they're saying on the news that a firefighter was shot at the scene of a car accident.
What? No, it wasn't a car accident.
<i>...but they report that she is a six-year veteranof the department, and she's now been transported...</i>
Chim, they're not talking about Eddie.
Come on! She's been shot! Let's go!
Another firefighter? We were ambushed.
The shot came out of nowhere.
What the hell is going on?
They were responding to a fender-bender when the shooting started.
You see it?
The police, the bystanders, the two drivers.
Shooter had plenty of potential targets, if he was looking for someone random.
Yeah, but he didn't take the shot. He waited.
Until Fire and Rescue arrived.
He's targeting firefighters.
<i>I don't understand.</i> Who'd want to shoot at firefighters?
Does this happen a lot?
It's definitely not an everyday occurrence, but there have been some instances where a company responded to a scene and someone started shooting at them.
Never heard of shots fired at multiple scenes on the same day.
Kind of wish I wasn't hearing about it right now.
Oh! Oh.
Looks like your hand-eye coordination is back to normal.
Fully healed. Thanks to all of you.
And...a lot of physical therapy.
So, what happens now?
We just wait for news about Eddie?
Or until the hospital staff kicks us off the campus.
It's been known to happen both ways.
Where's Buck?
He's got a harder job tonight.
Hey, Buck.
Hey.
Where's Dad?
Um, he...he's, uh, he's-he's not coming home tonight, Chris.
Why not?
Well, um...well, he-he got hurt at work today.
In a fire?
Um...uh...no.
No, not-not in a fire.
Uh, the truth is, someone...hurt your dad.
On purpose?
Yeah, I think so.
A bad guy?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, y...yeah.
Yeah, yeah, a b...a-a bad guy.
Is he gonna be okay?
You know, your dad is, uh...he's tough as nails.
He's a fighter, right?
So, uh, so he's-he's with the doctors now.
Like the ones that fixed you?
Uh-huh. Yeah, like-like the ones who fixed me.
Then he's gonna be okay, right?
Uh...
Yeah, I think so, buddy.
I think so.
It's gonna be okay, Buck.
<i>The Southland remains in the grip of an apparent sniper</i> who appears to be targeting firefighters and rescue personnel.
<i>And now it feels as if no open space</i> <i>is safe for the men and the women of the LAFD.</i>
This is something we haven't faced before.
I know it's scary -- the idea that someone is targeting us.
He couldn't have had much time to set up.
Probably listening to a scanner, then rushing to calls.
Last time, he got lucky.
Found a building he could access.
So where would be lucky here?
How good a shot do we think he is?
<i>We still have a job to do.</i> We're just gonna have to do it a little differently now.
<i>LAPD is putting</i> additional officers out there every shift.
But we still have limited resources, so we're going to have to think strategically, and we're going to have to work together. <i>That's great, Cap,</i> but we're still sitting ducks.
Well...

So I hear nobody got shot today.
That's good news.
Yeah, that was the first good news we've had all day.
I know you're tired.
Um, but I just wanted to say...I'm sorry.
I overreacted.
I should have let you know what was going on instead of trying to prove some point.
I'm sorry, too.
I mean, the whole thing seems so silly now.
I never should have tailed you like a suspect.
Hmm.
You know, after I was attacked, we never really talked about it.
Well, I always got the sense you didn't want to.
No, I mean...we never talked about what it was like for you.
There's that thing people say -- I don't know what I'd do without you.
Mm.
Because losing someone you love is such an alien concept.
You don't want to imagine what it's like.
Well, those people are not like us.
And I was sitting in that engine thinking I was listening to you dying.
And I didn't need to imagine anything.
I knew what my life would feel like without you in it, and it scared me.
I'm sorry I put you through that.
I know you were doing your job.
And I'm proud of you for that, but there is a small selfish part of me that wishes you didn't want to anymore.
I didn't.
No, after the attack and everything else going on in the world?
The last thing I wanted to do was ever put that uniform on again.
And then Elaine brought up retirement.
And I really did struggle with that decision.
Why didn't you tell me about that so I could help you through it?
Because I knew what you would do.
You would support me.
Give me permission to quit.
And I couldn't.
Couldn't let the bad guys win.
Mm-mm.
That's who you are.
You're a survivor.
We're survivors.
Good morning!
Oh, are we still in our pajamas?
School starts in 20 minutes.
Sorry, that's-that's my fault.
Slept through the alarm.
Oh, no, that's good -- that means you're getting some sleep.
Ah.
Buck snores loud.
Well, that's also good to know.
Okay. I, uh...I think it's time someone got ready for school.
I'll go. But I'm gonna need a nap later.
Because of all the snoring.
Yes. Okay.
Oh, my goodness.
He seems to be doing okay.
Y...You think he understands what's going on?
Boy's already lost his mother.
I think he understands more than we'd like him to.
Now, what about you?
I mean, how is it being back out there?
It's weird.
You know, the...team feels off without Eddie.
Not what I was asking about.
I'm really worried about you being out there.
I'm, uh...I'm fine.
I'm not the one who got shot.
Williams, you're with us.
What's going on?!
We didn't ask for cops! Our buddy's hurt!
Gentlemen, the police are here just as a precaution.
The sniper.
You've got a man pinned by a cable up there?
Don't know how the hell the cable came unseated, but it's got that on the end of it.
There's at least a couple thousand pounds of pressure on his arm. You can see it on the feed.
All right, take us there.
Poor Cliff, huh?
Yeah.
That beam goes, it's taking his arm with him.
Ooh. An arterial bleed, Cap.
With travel time, he's got eight minutes.
Maybe ten. It's pretty high up his arm.
He could bleed out quick. I talked to SWAT.
They're still ten minutes out.
Airship?
Maybe less, but not by much.
You'd be completely exposed up there, Captain.
We can't protect you. Look, we can sit here trying to do the math, Cap, but we got to get up there.
Uh, I think he beat you to it.
Of course he did.
Buck, nobody cleared you to go up there.
<i>You are completely exposed and we don't have</i> <i>any way to protect you. Buckley.</i> <i>Buckley, respond.</i>
I got this, Cap.
I brought a tourniquet. Hen and Chim <i>can walk me through anything else I need to do.</i>
Can you blame him, Cap?
Yeah.
Buck's gonna Buck.
<i>All right, Buck, his name is Cliff.</i> <i>And that cable that's got him pinned --</i> <i>there's no way to move it.</i>
<i>You got to cut it to drop the beam</i> <i>and release the pressure. But the tourniquet</i> <i>goes on first. We'll walk you through it.</i>
Oh, man, he's not looking too good.
Hey, Cliff.
My name is Buck.
And I'm gonna need to get you down.
Get this off of me!
Deal. First, we get this tourniquet on you, okay?
Hen, Chim, <i>I'm prepping the tourniquet.</i> You want to place it well above the wound.
Ah...
Don't forget to warn him.
Hey, Cliff, um, so this is gonna hurt.
<i>Okay. Cutting the cable.</i>
Make sure the area is clear down there.
Copy that. All clear.
Okay, Cliff. Gonna get you down.
All right, almost done.
There you are. There we go.
Hang in there, buddy. You're gonna be okay.
You sure about that? What about my arm?
Might be some nerve damage, but I think he'll keep his arm.
Thank you.
Don't thank us.
Thank the crazy guy.
Are you ever gonna say anything?
I don't know, Buck. What would you like me to say?
Uh, I mean-I mean, usually, it's...
"What were you thinking?" "That was reckless." Or my...personal favorite, "You could've been killed."
No, it doesn't seem like I need to have the conversation.
You know it by heart already.
And, still, you went full Buck.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
You'll never be the guy who thinks before he acts.
And I've learned to come to terms with that.
In part because I realized I don't have a choice.
You're never gonna change.
But also because I know, whatever actions you take, no matter how dangerous or impulsive they may be, they come from your heart.
Because you care.
Wow.
Thank you.
Today was not that.
You didn't get caught up in some moment and rush in where angels fear to tread.
You made a deliberate choice to make yourself a target.
Yeah.
I made myself a target because I wasn't gonna let any of you guys take that risk because I cannot handle anyone else getting hurt right now.
Buck, what happened to Eddie was not your fault.
No. No, I was just the guy standing there when it happened who couldn't do anything to protect him.
Well, today, I could do something to protect the rest of you.
So I did.
We are a team, and we're supposed to protect each other.
Don't do it again.
<i>That was it?</i> Yeah, it felt like some kind of weird reverse psychology thing.
Think I prefer it when he just yells at me.
Oh, I could yell at you if you think that would help.
Oh, come on, you can't be mad. You weren't even there.
There's at least half a dozen videos on the Internet of your climb up that crane.
All taken from nearby windows. Any one of those people could have had a gun and shot at your big, stupid head.
I was wearing a helmet.
Not made of Kevlar, dumbass.
Hold on a second. It almost sounds like you were worried about me.
I'm annoyed with you.
You're not invincible. You could've gotten hurt.
Or worse.
But I didn't.
Sorry.
Uh...
Okay.
Not sure where that came from.
Could be the wine.
Uh, ma-maybe we should talk about it.
Mm.
I should go.
W...
Ana.
Is everything okay?
Hey, Buck.
Hey.
<i>Hey, Dad.</i> I miss you.
<i>I miss you, too.</i> <i>But I'm gonna see you real soon.</i>
<i>I'll be home before you know it.
</i> Let yourself heal first, please.
You don't have anything to worry about.
Buck and I have it under control.
<i>Thanks.</i>
Love you, Dad.
<i>I love you too.</i> Appreciate you staying with him.
Carla offered to bring him to her house, but, uh, I figured this was overwhelming enough without having to sleep in a strange bed.
He doing okay?
Better than me.
Uh...I kind of lost it when I told him you got shot.
I-I'm sorry. I should've held it together.
You were there for him when I couldn't be.
That's what matters.
Still.
I think it might have been better for him if I was the one who got shot.
I heard the ballistics report from our shell casings came in.
They didn't send a report.
They sent him.
Chief Pate.
Sergeant.
Close the door.
The casing you found was from a .308-caliber round.
Fits what a sniper would use.
And matches the slugs from both scenes.
But none of that brings a deputy chief to deliver the news.
The ammunition was match grade.
More accurate, more expensive and much more traceable. Down to the lot number.
Ballistics reached out to the manufacturer to identify the purchaser.
Then they called me.
So our sniper didn't get his ammo from a gun shop.
He got it from us.
That bullet belongs to the LAPD.
Fire.
Go, go, go, go, go!
LAPD!
Kenneth Malone! Room clear.
Clear.
LAPD! Stay where you are! Hands on your head.
<i>Kenneth Malone.</i> <i>Eight years as a SWAT long rifleman</i> till he got fired six months ago after he accidentally shot a hostage.
Got a plan to get him talking?
Mm-hmm.
You.
You're the one wearing stripes on your arm, Sergeant.
And he strikes me as the type who'll respond to that.
<i>They got the sniper. He's in custody.</i>
That's a relief.
Yeah. Now things can get back to normal.
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
This isn't going to be a happy talk, is it?
I'm quitting, Sue.
Is everything okay at home?
I know you've been worried about Jee.
I'm failing her.
I'm just so tired all the time, and I can't focus, and I feel like I'm in this fog that I can't get free of.
And I need to do better. I-I need to...I need to be better.
And I can't do that and be here.
You know, if you feel like you need to spend more time at home, I understand.
But I want you to talk to...
Please don't say the counselors.
I want you to talk to Chimney.
What?
What you're describing and what I see when you're here, it feels like something more than just having too much on your plate.
Talk to him, Maddie.
<i>The LAPD armory</i> <i>keeps a detailed log of all match grade ammo.</i> The rounds used were issued to you while you were at SWAT.
That's crap.
I haven't touched a weapon in months.
Not since the...
The factory?
Right.
You shot the wrong man.
I'm guessing that whole business felt unfair.
The news turning you into public enemy number one.
You losing your job.
I quit my job.
When the department wanted to do a review, I told them not to bother.
I'd make it easy for everyone and I'd leave.
I didn't care about being cleared.
I cared that I made a mistake that I'm still trying to figure out how to live with.
I'm telling you, you got the wrong person.
You're looking for a guy who hates firefighters.
Hell, I wake up every morning grateful for them.
That they saved the one person I couldn't.
Can you tell me your location, sir?
<i>ETHAN 544 Hazleton.</i> What's your name, sir?
Ethan.
<i>-Ethan, are you there?</i> Dispatch said there is a single victim inside.
Name is Ethan. Buck, Ravi, hook us up to some hydrants. Start hitting it from out here.
Hen, Chim, you're with me.
Copy that.
Copy that.
Glad we don't need the bulletproof vests anymore.
Yeah.
I'm not missing them.
<i>They found Malone's gun</i> right where he said it'd be, buried in the yard.
Hasn't been fired in months.
Could be he used a different weapon.
Doesn't really feel like that, though, does it?
I don't think he's our guy.
But this ammo was his.
That's not a mistake.
So someone else had access to it. But who?
Hmm.
Riflemen don't work alone.
They work in pairs.
Ethan! You in there?
LAFD!
Ethan! Ethan!
No sign of him, Cap.
Dispatch said he might be unconscious.
I'm heading up to three.
Copy that, Cap!
LAFD! Anybody up here?
LAFD!
<i>118, we have an order to evacuate the building.</i>
Evacuate? On whose authority?
<i>LAPD.</i>
Ethan?
Ethan!
LAFD! Can you hear me?
Ethan!
Come in, captain Nash.
Cap, respond.
What's your 20?
Bobby's still inside?
They ordered everybody out the building, but he didn't follow.
He said he had eyes on our victim, Ethan.
Ethan Copeland?
He's not a victim. He's the sniper.
<i>Come in, Captain Nash.</i> Call them back in here. Do it.
And if I don't, what -- we burn?
Call 'em in.
Tell them you broke your leg or something. Do it.
Nah.
Think you've shot enough firefighters already.
The sniper's LAPD? Ex-LAPD.
After his partner quit, we realized Copeland was a problem and we removed him from duty.
Now he's making everybody pay for it.
Anybody have any idea where inside this building Bobby is?
He called it out when he found the guy.
Third floor, bravo side.
Somewhere around that window. All right.
SWAT's right behind us. We're taking over this scene.
You're taking over the fire?
Who are you?
Howard Han, 118.
And I guess since my captain's trapped inside that fire, <i>I'm</i> in charge of this scene.
Cap, come in.
Can you get me in there?
Look, I don't think Bobby...
Bobby's gonna die in there, Buck.
You need to help me. Help you do what?
Go get my husband.
<i>You're insane. We're both gonna die in here. For what?</i>
I'm done either way, so I might as well take as many of you out with me as I can.
Nobody's coming in. <i>It'll be easy.</i> Cut in on the delta side, where most of the fire's been contained.
She drops in, she makes her way across to bravo.
Except she'll be in a fire.
Put the gear on me. I'll be protected.
Trust me, I'm not gonna be in there that long.
Listen, we've got one of our own in there.
He's unprotected, possibly injured.
I need to know what your plan is before you make a move.
Just let me get my guys in position. Then I'll brief you.
We need to knock this fire down so we can go in there and get Cap.
Yeah. About that.
All right, come on, come on.
<i>Where the hell are they?</i>
You didn't make it easy.
The building is engulfed.
But it's not too late. You can still save yourself.
I can help you get out of here.
You ever think it's just a waste of time, Captain?
That some lives just don't deserve saving?
Everyone...deserves to be saved.
I'm going with you.
No, Buck.
I can't protect you in there.
He's trying to kill firefighters.
Yeah, and you're dressed as one.
All right, I'm going in.
Now tell me what to do.
<i>You know, there was a guy</i> that took this place hostage a few months back.
Hurt a bunch of people.
Me and my partner -- we tried to stop him.
But we made a mistake, and my partner shot the wrong person.
An innocent man got hurt.
We all make mistakes.
The thing is, that gunman...shouldn't have been alive.
He'd OD'd multiple times.
But you firefighters -- you so-called heroes -- you kept saving him!
That's the job.
You saved his life so he could go ruin someone else's!
We don't choose who lives or dies.
We save everyone we can.
You don't have to make the tough choices.
But people love you for it, and hate guys like me.
Chief, be advised, I have eyes on the suspect.
<i>Do you have a clean shot?</i>
Negative. Target red.
<i>You think saving lives</i> is a hard job?
Try having to take them.
Athena?
This is Athena Grant. Suspect is down.
Need medical assistance.
Captain Nash has been shot.
Athena, how did you...
I'm here. I got you.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Ethan?
He didn't make it.
Once we arrested Malone, Ethan knew it was just a matter of time before we figured out he was the real sniper.
You went into a burning building.
I didn't imagine that part, right?
You actually walked through fire.
Well...you were inside.
I wasn't gonna let a little fire stop me.
I needed to get my partner back.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Always.
You are not dead.
And you came back.
Uh, wasn't sure that was gonna happen.
Yeah. I kind of ran away.
Yeah, I noticed.
You didn't chase after me.
Listen, I, uh...I spent a long time feeling like I wasn't enough.
And I don't want to do that anymore.
So if you don't want me...
I do.
I really do.
Are you napping without me?
I quit my job.
What?
Did something happen?
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
I'm not okay in here.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I need help.
Okay.
I'll get you help, whatever it is.
We'll get you help, okay?
Uh-oh. I think I forgot the juice boxes.
Denny might have a meltdown.
My sweet baby? He would never.
Oh, you are such a grandmother.
You have no idea.
No.
Mommy Karen! Mommy Hen!
Oh! Nia!
What? What are you...Nia.
Nia? It's Mommy Hen and Mommy Karen.
Hi!
Nia. Nia, we should go.
Grammy!
Hi, precious. Look at you.
You are getting so big!
Your mommy must be feeding you well.
Where's big brother?
Hey, Nia!
Jungle gym. Jungle...
Don't worry. I got her.
Um...I'm-I'm Hen, and this is my wife Karen.
Nia's foster parents.
This is awkward.
I don't know what the rules are.
I...I don't think there are any.
I've thought so much about you.
About the things I wished I could say to you.
But now I don't...
How about we start with lunch?
We were just about to sit down to a little picnic.
Yeah, there's plenty.
Grammy doesn't know about portion control.
That'd be nice.
Thank you.
That's the thing I wanted to say.
Thank you.
Come on.
Okay, uh, nurse is getting your meds and discharge papers ready.
Then we can get out of here.
Great.
Hey, since we got a minute...
Uh, is everything all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh, I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
Okay.
So, you might have noticed I almost died.
Again.
Yeah, I've had a lot of close calls.
This one wasn't even my closest.
Yeah. Eddie...
Just let me finish.
After the last time, when that well collapsed on top of me...
Which you survived.
After that...it got me thinking.
You know, what would happen to Christopher if I hadn't?
So I went to my attorney and changed my will.
So, someday, if, I, uh...didn't make it...Christopher would be taken care of.
By you.
What?
It's in my will, if I die, you become Christopher's legal guardian.
Uh...
I mean, h-how-how does that even work? Don't you...don't-don't you need my consent?
My attorney said you could refuse.
You know I wouldn't.
Nah, I know you wouldn't.
I mean, he-he has grandparents, other family.
Yeah.
After Shannon left, they all tried to guilt me into giving Christopher to them.
It's not what I wanted then, it's not what I want now.
If it came to that, w-wouldn't they fight for him?
I don't know.
Maybe. Probably.
But no one will ever fight for my son as hard as you.
That is what I want for him.
Well, you said you did this last year.
Why are just telling me now?
Because, Evan, you came in here the other day and you said you thought it would have been better if it had been you who was shot.
You act like you're expendable.
But you're wrong.

Well, you're meeting her parents.
We're meeting everybody. Her parents, her tíos,her tías,her primos.
Her whole family's going to be there.

It's not.
Not the way you guys are making it sound.
It's the next step. You know, she's showing you off to the entire family.

Hi Kirby. I'm May.

Nothing is working.

Do you have anything you could use to break the windows?

Fire and rescue are plan B.
What's plan A?
Can you swim?
What?
Kirby. Can you swim?
Yes, but I'm still sinking and the door won't open!
You can't open the door because the pressure of the water outside is greater than the pressure inside.
But it will equalize.
When that happens, you're gonna open the door and swim to surface.
(scoffs) I have to let myself sink?
I'm-I'm going to drown in here!
I don't want to die!
Kirby, stop.
I'm not ready!
Do not panic.
I don't wanna die!
You're gonna listen to me and we're gonna get you out of that car. Okay?
Okay, okay.
First, take off your seat belt.
Then, kick off your shoes. Jacket, too.
Anything that's gonna weigh you down needs to go.
Keep your mouth and nose above the water for as long as you can.
When the water starts to cover your face, that's when you'll take a big breath of air, as much as you can.
And then I open the door?
Just enough to slip out.
Okay.
The car will fall away from you.
Then, you kick-kick-kick your way to the surface.

REPORTER: Representatives from GoGo Anywhere suggested a bug in the most recent update might be what caused the navigation app to malfunction.
Malfunction?
There were accidents all over the city.
But if I could figure out what caused it to happen...
Okay. (grunts) Hey, I'm still working.
Working or grasping at straws?
It was a bug.
Okay? They'll-they'll put out an update tomorrow and it'll be over with.

Ooh.
I got a few ideas.
Mm.
I have an idea, too.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles) (phone clicks) Uh, okay...
Thank you.
You said you have the app.
I want to see when the last update was.
Two weeks ago?
Uh, no, t-that can't be right.
All the accidents happened today.
They lied.
Whatever happened wasn't a bug in their software.
So what was it?
It was a ransomware attack.
Now, where'd you hear that?
She knows a guy.
You know a guy?
I'm an engineer, Michael. I know a lot of guys.
Mm.
Anyway, this one works at GoGo Anywhere, and, uh, he wanted to know if I knew of anyone else who had been hit.
And?
A defense contractor in Texas. Last week.
And another one in Michigan, the week before that.
And this is the first time we're hearing about this?
You also didn't hear about the other 4,000 cyberattacks that happen every day.
Yeah, but there's backups, right?
You know, redundancies, firewalls.
Systems designed to-to help protect us from being kicked back into the dark ages by faceless guys on the Internet.
Sort of.
What?
Look, there is no way to perfectly protect any system.
Right? And most things in our lives are run on some sort of automated system.
Banking, supply chains, the lights in your house, the water in your faucet.
Someone screws with enough of those systems and...
people realize that society isn't as resilient as we think it is.

CLERK: Next case before the court, The State of California v. Jeffery Connor Hudson.
Pretrial motions. Honorable Judge Priya Atkins presiding.
Bring in the defendant.
(lock buzzes) (women giggling) Oh, look. His fan club's here.
(gavel bangs) ATKINS: We're on the record.
All right, whom do we have present?
Your Honor, Ken Decker for the state.
(quietly): You need me to...
Does the defense need a moment?
Your Honor, the defendant has informed me that my services will no longer be required.
He just fired me.
He intends to represent himself.
Objection...
What do you mean, objection?
ATKINS: Settle down. Order!
This is me trying to get a fair trial.
(gavel banging) Settle down. Mr. Hudson, if I do allow you to represent yourself, you'll do so with decorum and you'll follow the rules.
Mr. Decker, I'll hear what you have to say.
Everyone else, please sit down.
Ms. Risco, for the time being, that includes you.
Your Honor, this defendant is charged with six counts of rape.
Heinous crimes that involved him stalking his victims, lying in wait inside their homes, and then viciously attacking them. In addition, he brutally assaulted an LAPD sergeant, beating her nearly to death.
All of these women will be key witnesses in this trial.
To subject them to being questioned by their attacker would be tantamount to allowing him to assault them again.
I'd like to see counsel in chambers.
(gavel bangs) Here you are.
Thanks.
Is he really gonna get to do this?
Be the one firing questions at us?
Because I don't think I can take that.
Which is what he wants. But you all are stronger than he thinks.
Damn right. You've already proven it.
So let's just wait and see what the judge says.
Oh, God, look at them.
So disgusting.
Have you seen their "Free Jeffery Hudson" Facebook group?
Women like that have something broken inside of them that makes them fall for psychopaths.
Don't look at them. They don't deserve your attention.
Hey, Athena.
I'm sorry. The judge is going to allow Hudson to represent himself.
ATHENA: All right.
Remember what we said. He can't hurt you.
Just stay strong.
DECKER: Glad to hear you feel that way.
He also just filed a motion to suppress all evidence found at Studio Self Storage.
(scoffs) Those trophies are all that we have linking Hudson back to his victims.
I'm aware of that. Believe me.
Sergeant Grant nearly gave her life to get us that evidence.
I'm aware of that, too. And so is the judge.
She's going to hear arguments next session.
She's actually considering this motion?
DECKER: She is. And she's allowing Hudson to call his first witness: you.

Dad!
Eddie, Eddie. Call 911!
(gasping loudly) Well, it wasn't a heart attack.
ANA: Thank God.
Are you sure?
You sound disappointed.
No. I'm just...surprised.
It...it sure felt like one.
Panic attacks can often present as heart attacks.
EDDIE: That's not what this was.
It's not possible. I-I don't panic.
Because you're a guy?
And a firefighter.
Now that's a stressful job.
This didn't happen on the job.
Panic attacks aren't rational, Mr. Diaz.
But they can be an indicator of some underlying anxiety.
Have you experienced any lifestyle changes lately?
Any new stressors?
No. Nothing. It's been great.
Right?
CHRISTOPHER: He got shot.
(Ana clears throat) Eddie was shot four months ago on duty.
He almost died.
The sniper.
EDDIE: He's dead, and I'm not.
I don't even think about him anymore.
That could be called repression.

♪ It may sound funny, but I don't believe ♪ ♪ She's coming, oh, oh...♪ Sergeant Grant, are you familiar with a facility known as "Studio Self Storage"?
Intimately.
And on the evening of May 4, 2020, did you have occasion to enter this facility?
I did.
And who granted you access to this business?
No one did. I just walked in.
JEFFERY: You just walked in?
With a warrant?
No warrant was necessary.
Really? How's that?
I observed that an outside door had been suspiciously wedged open, so I conducted a business check.
Right, right. "Business check." That's, uh, one of those phrases cops deploy when they want to get around pesky things like warrants.
Prejudicial, Your Honor.
Mr. Hudson, let's keep it in check.
Did anyone else see this suspiciously wedged open door, Sergeant Grant?
No.
No. Just you.
And did you turn on your body camera when you entered?
I didn't get a chance to. I was attacked...by you.
That's your version.
I remember it the other way around.
As I recall, a lot of people heard it over the radio.
Oh. Then I'm sure they heard you identify yourself as police, hmm?
I followed procedure.
Of course.
Sergeant Grant, how many times have you been put on restricted duty for misconduct?
A few.
How about five times?
I'm good police.
No. My, uh...
my personal favorite is the time that you threatened a teenage girl you felt was bullying your daughter.
I felt?
That girl drove my daughter to attempt suicide.
So you arrested this minor, and you threw her in jail.
You know, some people might consider that an abuse of power.
She had drugs on her person.
She said they weren't hers.
They usually do.
And sometimes police plant evidence.
Your Honor!
Mr. Hudson, are we approaching a point?
Given that the state's entire case against me rests on this so-called evidence obtained by an illegal search by a rogue cop with a history of misconduct, I would move that all items claimed to have been found at Studio Self Storage be suppressed and not considered evidence in this trial.
(gallery murmuring) Thank you.

 We have a lot more mouths to feed than usual with the emergency recall procedure put in place.
You know the drill.
All shifts in the house until further notice.
Couldn't you stash some of the good stuff in the back of the fridge for the A shift?
Refrigerator is off-line and off limits starting this afternoon.
We've been running that generator 24-7.
 We got to cut back on our fuel use.
 Hey, Hen, you hearing this?
We're losing fridge privileges.
The hurt gets spread evenly around and no one's immune, I suppose.
Hey, can I borrow your charger? My phone's dead.
Oh, sorry.
This is my department-issued personal charging device.
And sharing is against protocol.
What?
Who issued you that?
I see someone hasn't met the power czar.
After a requisition form has been submitted, you will be issued a personal charging device.
Once it is dead, you return it to the probie charging pool, and it will be recharged for you.
You can just say Ravi.
Ravi will recharge it for you.
One charge per 24 hours is the limit.
Do not attempt to bribe me or you will be docked two charges.
Give me a charger or Uncle Buck will never see his niece again.
Give him the charger.
 Well-played.
 So let this be a lesson.
Never give Buck a clipboard.
Never.
Excuse me for being efficient.
That's one word for what you are.
Dad!
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
We brought you food.
 Hey.
 Mwah.
You guys didn't have to do that.
It was Christopher's idea.
He kept saying how much he missed Dad  and thought you were hungry.
 Uh-huh.
So we've got bean salad, tuna salad, and this one is just, uh, <i>salad</i> salad.
Ah. Hey, Buck!
Oh, looks like the new chief is here.
How are you?
 Good. I'm good.
 Oh, Ravi, this is, uh, my son Christopher.
Chris, this is Ravi Panikkar.
You're a firefighter?
I'm what they call a probationary firefighter.
Did you do something wrong?
Constantly.
I'm Ana. Hi.
 Hi.
 You must be Eddie's wife?
Not yet.
So...even in the dark, this place is amazing.
Uh, you've never been here.
 Uh...
 No, I haven't.
Probie, you know, why don't you take Ana on a tour?
I'm gonna put this stuff up there and...
I don't want these things to wilt.
 Come on.
 All right.
I'll show you all around.
Come on, Chris.
Go, go, go!
All right, that's us, let's go!
Move, move, move! Suspect is a white male.
Keep your eyes open. Move, move, move!
This way.
Eyes peeled. Eyes peeled.
Go. In, go.
<i>- Aptain Maynard, house is clear.
 C.</i> <i>You're gonna want to see this.</i> Dead lawyer, dead end.
Well, her car's still in the garage, so he didn't take that.
Maybe he teamed up with one of those groupies.
No.
His only accomplice is right there.
You think so?
I do.
My mind just keeps going back to the visitor logs from Men's Central Jail.
The only name that appeared more times than his groupies  was hers.
 She was his lawyer.
Whom he fired and whose place he came straight to after he escaped.
I don't think it was to get a refund on his retainer.
You think they were lovers.
Bed's still made.
I think she was smitten just like the other fools.
I think she saw him being led away in cuffs and she intervened on his behalf.
We thought we were saving her.
I don't think she wanted to be saved.
So she attempts to murder a Los Angeles police detective to help him escape.
And he kills her for the favor? I mean, why would he do that?
Jeffery Hudson's not a one-woman kind of guy.
It's a little scary how deep inside this guy's head you are.
Not deep enough.
He's always two steps ahead.
A lot more than that.
Five-day lead...he could be halfway to Florida by now.
No, no, I don't think so.
A city plunged into utter darkness is exactly the place he'd like to be.
No better hunting ground for a predator like him.
No, I don't think he's gone anywhere at all.
In that case, maybe we need to warn his previous victims.
Actually, maybe we don't.
Maybe we don't warn them at all.
<i>What kind of animal?</i> We've been over this, Buck...We don't know.
It could be anything. Caller got cut off  during the attack.
 Okay.
So, so ransomware busts open all the cages at the ♪. A. Zoo and-and they call us?
No one thinks to call, I don't know, Animal Control?
I asked about Animal Control.
They've been busy since the breakout.
Yeah. They, uh, tranq'd a lion at Griffith Park.
That's right, Mustafa was at the Greek Theatre.
And they got Sarabi and the cubs heading down Los Feliz towards Cahuenga.
I guess all mammals know to use the Franklin Pass.
No, I don't think you guys are hearing me. Okay, this is not me and Eddie bagging a turkey in South Pasadena.
What-what gear do we even bring?
You know, they-they have serious predators at the ♪. A. Zoo.
A snow leopard. A Sumatran tiger.
He takes Christopher there all the time.
 Got the place memorized.
 A chimpanzee!
A chimp will literally rip your face off without even thinking twice about it.

Look at that ear.
Sir, can you tell us what did this to you?
Is that...?
That...is an alpaca.
I thought they were peaceful.
Any animal is peaceful, Cap, until it's provoked.
And alpacas...are pretty vicious.
It's called berserk syndrome.
And it's a thing.
You know a lot about alpacas.
Well, we were gonna get one.
He bit my ear off!
 I wouldn't.
 Not gonna.
We need to get it to move out of the way.
Maybe we can attract it with some food?
Reese's Pieces?
They eat mostly grass and grains, Cap.
All right, well...
You know, corn's a grain, right?
Worth a try.
Here you go.
All right.
Hey there.
Can you move?
My ankle's busted.
It's all right. I got you.

Okay, come on, come on.

Hen, come on, come on.

It's-it's calling its friend.
Clever girl.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Two alpacas, and there was no running.
Just get in the truck.

Hey, are you sleeping or just pretending?
I was actually trying to, until you interrupted.
I'm exhausted.
Uh, h-how are you feeling?
Hot. I'm sweating out of places I didn't know I could.
Not like a cold sweat though, right? A-Any chest pains?
You don't give up, do you?
 I'm fine, Buck.
 People who are fine don't go and see cardiologists.
You need to tell me if something is wrong.
All right. It was a panic attack.
Not a heart attack.
Panic.
Since when do you panic?
That's what I said. I don't panic.
Except I did.
Okay, well, what triggered it?
I mean, you did just get shot and almost killed by a sniper. I guess that could be considered anxiety-inducing.
That wasn't it, okay?
If I'm being honest with myself, I think it was Ana.
Uh...
I thought things were great with her.
Yeah. She's been a godsend through all this.
Staying with Christopher, you know. But I...
I think that's what's causing the panic.
Somehow we became a ready-made family and I...
I don't know if I'm...ready for that.
So what are you gonna do?
I think I'm just gonna stick it out.
Ana's been the first woman I've wanted  to spend this much time with since Shannon.
 Stick it out?
That's not the way you talk about someone you're in love with.
My kid loves her.
Is that enough?
Eddie, I have been Ana.
I know what it's like to be in love with someone who is not all the way in.
Deep down you know it, and it hurts.
It hurts worse than the truth.
So if you don't want to hurt Ana, you owe it to her to be honest.
You know, it just feels like a lot, man.
Well, go to sleep.
You don't need to decide right now.
It's not like we're going home any time soon.
Hey, Maddie.
Uh, you're probably asleep.
Nothing to worry about.
I was just calling to say hey.
All right, call me when you can.
Love you.
Hey.
 Everything okay?
 Yeah.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
You don't sound sure.
Well, we've been on duty for days and Maddie is home alone in the apartment with a baby and no power.
Yeah, but it's Maddie.
She's been through worse than a blackout, Chim.
And she's always been able to handle herself.
Yeah, Maddie's not really Maddie lately.
She has postpartum depression.
It started a few months ago.
It's kind of been a roller-coaster ride.
No one knows?
No.
She already feels like a failure 'cause she's struggling so much.
So other people knowing would just make it worse.
So you're hovering?
Maybe, a little.
Probably a lot. I just don't know how to stop myself.
Chim, she's not your patient.
She's your partner.
She just needs you to love her and support her.
So stop trying to fix her.
Yeah.
You're right, it's Maddie.
She'll be fine.
If you think this is great wait till I show you the ocean.
Are you okay?
Okay, okay.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
So she's okay?
Lungs seem clear. 02 levels look good.
I don't think she inhaled any water.
And what about her head?
CT doesn't show any injury and I checked her head twice...No sign of a bump.
Thank God.
Now, obviously, I want you to keep an eye on her.
If there's any change in her breathing pattern, if she starts coughing or vomiting, bring her back immediately.
 I will.
 But...
I think she's gonna be fine.
How are you doing?
Shaky.
Just feel like the adrenaline's wearing off.
Then you should get her home.
I bet you both could use a good night's sleep.
I'll have the nurse have you discharged.
Thank you.
For everything. It's been a pretty terrifying night so far.
Well, probably not the last you'll experience before she makes it to adulthood.
And I speak from experience.
I feel like I age a decade every time one of my kids has an accident.
How was your day four?
Or are we in day five of this craziness?
Well, five, I think.
You know, lions, tigers blood-spitting alpacas on Hollywood Boulevard.
 The usual. <i>- How is it that every time</i> <i>it seems the world is ending,</i> it ends some more?
<i>Because it never actually does, just</i> keeps us on our toes.
More like knocks us on our asses.
<i>Yeah? How so?</i> I am sitting outside this woman's home, waiting for Jeffery Hudson to make a move.
And yet I haven't warned her.
Or the other victims.
<i>They're not helpless bait, Athena.</i> They are protected because you are there looking out for them.
That man stood in court the other day called me a rogue cop.
Here I am, fulfilling the prophecy.
<i>You are doing your job, and</i> <i>those women have been hurt enough already.</i> <i>Besides, there's a good chance he never even shows.</i> Is it bad that I hope he does?
I hope that for you too, baby.
<i>Bobby Nash.</i> Did you just say you hoped I come face to face with a dangerous escaped fugitive tonight?
I believe I did.
Well, that might be the sweetest thing you have ever said to me.
<i>I want you to be the one who gets him.</i> Except this time, don't shoot him in the leg.
<i>Oh, I'm gonna aim higher</i> and empty the clip.
Believe that.
Got to call you back.
I just got some very esteemed reinforcements.
<i>Be safe.</i> Well, this might be an LAPD first.
Don't think I've ever seen a captain on a stakeout.
That's why I left my bars at the station.
Captain, what are you doing here?
Eh, you know, one way or another Hudson is responsible for slicing up one of my guys and putting him on life support, so at this point, it's personal.
So I'm relieving you.
Respectfully, Captain thanks but no thanks. I'm not leaving.
Yes, you are.
Ransone is awake.
And he's asking for you again.
We were able to extubate him a few hours ago, but he hasn't been able to speak.
He's still got the pen and paper, though, which tells me the stroke hasn't significantly impaired  his cognitive abilities.
 That is good news.
I heard you were looking for me.
You save your strength, Lou.
But it is damn good to see you too.
Yeah, we found her dead.
Gunshot wound. Probably two days old.
I figured it.
I just put the pieces together a little too late.
I'm so sorry I wasn't there, Lou.
In the wind.
Again.
More like some hunches.
Maynard thinks he's probably long gone by now, but I'm not so sure of that.
I think that's our best chance of catching him.
We have surveillance units posted at all the victims' houses.
And we're waiting for him.
My house? What about it?
No, no, it's okay, Lou, it's okay.
You're victim too.
These people aren't leaving.
I should've let Harry charge them by the hour.
Guess you're regretting that "we're supposed to help" "our neighbors in their time of need" speech?
Yeah, well, technically, they're not  my neighbors anymore.
 Ooh.
Hmm?
No. Mom has to work until the emergency's over.
That's too bad.
I was really hoping to see her.
Athena?
Bobby, I'm on my way to the house, but I'm still ten minutes out. Can you get there before me?
<i>Well, I can try. Traffic is</i> <i>pretty clogged here by the firehouse.</i> Aren't Michael and David there with Harry?
<i>They're not picking up.</i> Bobby...
I was so worried about Jeffery Hudson going after one of his victims that I forgot...
You're one of them, too.
I'm on my way.
 Chim.
 What's up, Bobby?
Here, you're in charge. I'm taking the captain's truck.
I will explain later.
What? What's going on?
Elaine, I'm almost home.
<i>I'm five minutes away.</i> And I managed to get some units out there.
Do not go in there alone.
 I don't think that's an option. <i>- Athena!</i> The last time you went in without backup, it did not end well.
People keep talking to me about the last time.
I no longer have the luxury to dwell on that.
Michael? You here?
 Hands up! Don't move!
 No, no, no! Athena, it's me!
 It's me, it's me, it's me!
 Michael, what the hell?!
 I almost shot you!
 Yeah, I can see that.
Now, what the hell is going on?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Where is everyone? Why is the house so dark?
 I thought you had people here.
 The generator went out.
Everybody left.
Goes to show you who your friends are, right?
Ah! And let there be light.
Oh good. We're back.
Wait, did it just out of gas?
No, it was unplugged.
Someone must have kicked out a plug by accident.
Athena?
 Everything okay?
 He's not here.
Who's not here?
Would somebody mind telling me what in the hell is going on?
Michael.
Where's Harry?
Uh, he was just here.
Uh, there's his phone.
Residents only.
You're gonna have to turn around or show some ID.
Sorry about that, Detective.
We've had some reports of break-ins.
Can never be too careful.

Mr. Hudson.
We were able to extract the bullet from your hip.
The bullet did, however, enter the groin area.
We salvaged what we could.
We placed a stent in your urethra to keep the opening patent.
You'll need a Foley catheter for the next few weeks, but once the sutures are removed and the muscles heal, you should be able to urinate on your own.
Though it will have to be sitting down.
Well, Nurse Miles here will check on your dressing.

I can't believe we just did that.
There it is.
 His home address.
 What for?
Jeffery, we should leave.
And then what?
You made me a murderer.
That's what a crappy lawyer you are.
Instead of getting me off for rape, you're gonna get me hung for murder.
You didn't kill him, I did.
I wasn't talking about him.

Oh, well, the guest bathroom's over here.
Show me?
Are you from the neighborhood?
I don't think I recognize you.
I'm a friend of your mom's.
 From work?
 Something like that.
So this house party, when did it start?
Like, um, early.
10:00 a. m., people started popping by.
Do you remember the last time you saw your son?
Oh, God. Honestly, I'm not sure.
You need to be sure, Michael.
Yeah, but I'm not, Athena.
What the hell were you thinking?
Just letting strangers just traipse in and out  of our house like that?
 They're not strangers, they're neighbors. Your neighbors.
And I probably wouldn't have, had I known that there was some psycho with a vendetta out for you  who had escaped and was out on the loose!
 Michael, Michael, where were you when the generator died?
The generator did not die. It was unplugged. David said so.
Somebody probably kicked that plug out of the wall.
I was tripping on it all day long.
Nobody tripped over any plug.
Jeffery Hudson was in this house, I know it.
He cut the power and he took our son.
We don't know that for sure. Not yet.
Harry's not at any of the neighbors' houses  that we checked.
 And nobody we spoke to remembers seeing him leaving, by himself or with anyone matching Hudson's description.
We are wasting time. We need to get detectives down here.
And, no offense, I appreciate the help, but my ex-husband's surgeon boyfriend does not need to be the one  out here canvassing.
 All right, I'll see who's available. Excuse me.
Hello? <i> Mom?</i>  Harry?
 Harry, are you okay?
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>  Where are you? <i>  I'm not sure.</i> What do you mean you're not sure?
<i>- He means the whole city's dark.
 Jeffery!</i> <i>You know, I gotta commend you. Somebody raised this boy right.</i> <i>He's been very polite.</i> <i>When I threatened to shoot everyone in your house,</i> <i>he did exactly as I asked.</i> You do not have to do this, Jeffery.
<i>- Don't I?
 No.</i> <i>I feel like I kinda have to do something.</i> <i>I don't think my court case was really going all that well,</i> <i>to be honest, and, well, things have escalated.</i> Things are not nearly as bad  as you think they are. <i>  Really?</i> <i>'Cause they seem pretty bad.</i> You can escape, Jeffery.
Half the state's in the dark.
Our resources are spread razor-thin.
Nobody even knew you were missing for four days.
Nobody has to come looking for you now.
If you can make it to the border, you can just walk into Mexico and be home free.
<i>- Just that easy?
 Yeah.</i> Just let my son go, unharmed, and I promise you I will not come after you.
<i>I'd like to believe that, but</i> <i>I just don't think you have it in you</i> <i>- to give up.
 You're wrong.</i> <i>When you finally realized that I never made it back to lockup,</i> <i>did it occur to you even once to warn your family?</i> <i>No, it did not.

Thought you were headed home.
Josh said you wanted to see me?
Why don't we sit down.
What's wrong?
It's your brother.
 He's missing. Kidnapped.
 What? Who would...
Jeffery Hudson.
He's in jail.
Well, he's supposed to be, but there was some kind of mix-up.
He's been on the loose since the night the blackout started.
The police just realized the mistake tonight.
But how did Harry...
Hudson showed up at the house.
He took your brother.
I have to go. My parents...
They want you here.
What? I should be with them, helping them find my brother.
I promised your mother that I would keep you here and keep you safe.
 I guess she has enough to worry about.
 Yeah.
Just know that we're doing the best we can.
Yeah, I know. All right.
Well, a BOLO's been issued,  and an Amber Alert.
 That's it?
Nobody's taking this lightly, Michael.
Elaine's pulling what resources she can.
So, but-but where does that leave us?
Elaine wants me to wait here.
And hopefully Jeffery won't be able to resist taunting me, and he'll call again.
That's not much of a plan.
It's all we got.
How about I radio the station and let 'em know  I'm not coming in tonight?
 No.
Go back to work.
I mean, this city can use all the heroes it can get right now.
Okay. I'm a phone call away.
 Love you.
 Love you, too.
 Hey, Bobby. Can you do me a favor?
 Yeah.
Can you drop off David at my place on your way?
Sure.
 Hey, I am so sorry this has happened.
 Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay what's the plan?
 I just told you the plan.
 Athena, now I was married to you for 17 years.
And there is no way in hell that you are gonna sit here and wait for that phone to ring.
So whatever the next step is, I'm taking it with you.
This is our son. And damn it, you are not leaving me behind this time.
All right.
So what are you thinking?
Well, we know he's using Ransone's car, his gun, and his badge.
So it makes me wonder what else of Ransone's has he been using?
Damn it.
Okay, Harry...
Come on now, buddy. You don't want to do this.
You know I can't leave you out here alone.
It's just not safe.
I'm not fooling around, kid.
I don't have time for this.
I'm gonna give you to the count of five to show yourself.
Then I'm gonna go back and put a bullet in everyone you love.
One.
Two.
Three! Knock it off.
 Help!
 Get in the car.
 Just get in the car.
 Help!
Hey, what are you doing?
It's okay, ma'am, I'm a police officer.
This kid's in my custody.
 Caught him breaking into the building.
 He's lying!
Taking advantage of the blackout, no doubt.
 Help, please. He's gonna kill me. He's not a cop.
 Hey, hey!
 Stop resisting.
 Please.
If you have a phone, record us.
My parents need to know what happened to me.
You said you're a cop.
Where's your badge? Show it to me.
You can't be serious.
You want to see my badge?
Here it is? See?
Okay? I told you, I'm a cop.
It's nothing to worry about, okay?
You and your pooch have a great night, okay?
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i> <i>My friend got shot. We're in the PPZ.</i> <i>- The what?
 The Autonomous Cop-Free Zone.</i> <i>On Santa Monica and Vermont.</i> Dispatch says there's a Gold Line Metro station in the middle of this thing.
 Can't we use that to sneak in?
 I don't sneak.
I don't know who called you guys.
No official passes these barricades.
 We don't need you!
 Get out of here!
 We have volunteers to take care of that.
 But they're not.
Someone in your camp called 911.
That's who we are. We are 911.
You've got a man in there bleeding out.
You have your rules, and we have ours.
 Why is everyone just standing there? They won't let us in.
This wannabe mayor is blocking the way 'cause of some stupid rule. Get the hell out of here!
Really? Since when do anarchists have rules?
 Get out!
 Adapt or die.
There's no rules here.
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to be here.
I'm not supposed to crack your skull open with this either.
Where is the injured guy?
 Help. Over here!
 All right, clear a path.
Gunshot wound. Looks like a through-and-through.
Brachial artery looks to be intact. Chim?
 Got it.
 All right, I'll call it in.
Take some breaths.
So, that was awesome, Cap.
Just not having it tonight, huh?
Everything okay?
Harry's been kidnapped.
 What's the paint for?
 Never mind.
You can't get away, you know.
I know.
Mean old Mommy's gonna come after me, right?
No, actually I was thinking about my dad.
He's gonna beat your ass.
Enough of this crap.
Hands.
Hands, damn it!
So our boy was really charging neighbors five dollars a head?
I hope you told him to give it back.
Yes.
It was enterprising.
God, what if we don't find him?
What if we get to Lou's apartment and there's nothing?
We don't know what we're gonna find, Michael.
 You told Maynard that we're not waiting for them, right?
 Yeah.
She said she'd send whoever she could, but no, I'm not waiting for backup.
I just don't understand it.
I mean, why does this guy hate you so much?
I mean, he could really be in Mexico right now.
Why is he still coming after you?
I shot off his junk.
I'm sorry, you did what, now?
His magic wand. I shot it off.
 No, you did not.
 I did.
 Well, that would do it. Okay.
 It's not funny, Michael.
The hell it's not. I mean, considering what you arrested him for?
I mean, it's poetic.
He was using it as a weapon.
You disarmed the man.
"Hands in the air! Drop it!" I didn't do it on purpose.
But I will say I am not sorry.
All right, we're here.
All right, I guess, uh, this is the part where you tell me that you're the cop, and I'm the architect, and I can't come in there with you.
I wouldn't dare. But I go first.
All right.
Clear.
Bedroom clear.
Is anyone even staying here?
Oh, yeah.
He was here, and he wants me to know it.
Is that a message?
If the middle finger's a message, oh, yeah.
It's a message.
Okay, well, then what else is here?
You know, maybe that's not the only message he left behind.
Maybe there's something else.
You know, a clue to where he took Harry.
Michael, don't touch anything!
What?!
This is a crime scene.
We gotta let 'em go over it.
 We said we wouldn't wait for them.
 We didn't.
But now we gotta let 'em bring in their fine-tooth combs and do their jobs.
This entire room is filled with evidence.
That could lead us to our son.
 Michael. Michael!
 What?!
Do you just want me to stand here and not do anything?
Is that what you're saying to me?
How in the hell am I supposed to do that, Athena?
 He took our son and he's gone!
 Michael, hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Look at me. We're gonna find him.
We're not done. Not yet.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's May.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
<i>May?</i> <i>Mom, I found Harry.</i> <i>- Help. Help!
 Get in the car.</i> <i>She got it from social media?</i> <i>Yeah. Ever since we had our run-in</i> <i>with your Officer of the Year Reynolds,</i> <i>May gets alerts for videos of cops acting out.</i> <i>Well, I never thought I would say this,</i> <i>but thank God for nosy Karens and their Twitter accounts.</i> Well, our Karen is a Judy, and she lives in Santa Clarita.
 May DM'd her. <i>  Got it. Keep me posted.</i> <i>Detectives are processing Lou's apartment now.</i> <i>- We'll let you know what they find.
 Only a matter of time.</i> Come on. Come on, kid. Come on.
Get in there.
Get in there!
Look, you can scream all you want, kid.
There's no one around to hear.
Listen to me. Hey. Look. I want you to know none of this is your fault. Okay?
It's not mine either. It's hers.
Your mother can save you, or she can come after me.
But she can't do both.
<i>- Help. Help!
 Get in the car.</i> <i>- Hey, what are you doing?
 He's not a cop.</i> <i>He's gonna kill me.</i>  You said this happened three hours ago?
 Yeah.
It took me a really long time to upload the video.
My connection kept dropping out. I almost gave up.
Thank you for doing this.
You know, just to see his face, and to know that he's still fighting, and that he's still alive...
Now, tell me, what did you see before the video?
I mean, was he hurting Harry?
They were struggling. The guy was trying to get him back into the car.
I knew that something was wrong, but then he showed me his badge.
And you pulled out your phone.
That was your son's idea.
 He's a really smart kid.
 Yeah.
 You guys did a great job.
 Thank you.
You hear that, babe?
Is that your wife?
Ex-wife.
<i>Okay, I'm on the freeway.</i> Where am I going? <i> Hey, slow down.</i> <i>We're gonna get to that in a minute.</i> <i>First, the ground rules.</i> Come alone, no backup. I get it, don't worry.
<i>Oh, I'm not worried, but you should be.</i> <i>Because where we're going, there are no police allowed.</i> The autonomous zone?
I'll see you here, Sergeant Grant.
What's he doing? He still hasn't moved.
Leave it alone, Buck. Nobody's going in there.
I can't imagine what Cap's going through right now.
If it was Christopher, I'd be losing my mind.
Why Harry? Thought this guy's thing was attacking women.
Pretty sure that's exactly what he's doing, Buck.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Hail Mary...
Michael.
<i>Bobby, we've got an emergency.</i> Nice night for a walk.
You lost?
I believe I'm home.
They said this is the People's Protection Zone?
Well, I'm people.
And you need protection?
Actually, I do.
 From who?
 An animal with a badge.
You're in the right place.
What's this pig look like?
<i>See? I'm a cop.</i>  Maybe you can share this with your people? <i>- Okay?</i> <i>Here it is.</i> I'm here, alone. Just like I said.
 Where's my son? <i>Don't you worry about that</i> <i>right now.</i> You may have brought me down here to put a bullet in me, but I'm not gonna give you that chance.
Not till you tell me where my son is.
<i>Hey, you are not the one calling the shots here,</i> <i>Sergeant Grant, I am.</i> <i>So what, you gonna pick me off from the shadows?</i> Is that your plan, Jeffery?
What about all these innocent civilians?
<i>Innocent?</i> Really? They've commandeered eight city blocks.
They're hardly innocent. They're thieves.
Well, whatever they are, I don't think they'll take too kindly to a dirty cop killing someone in the middle of their People's Paradise.
You got yourself an exit strategy worked out?
Oh, I've got everything worked out.
 Yeah, I bet you do.
 And when you say "dirty cop," are you referring to me or to you?
<i>I'm not dirty.</i> <i>And I'm not a cop.</i> <i>Really? 'Cause that's not what I hear</i> <i>you been telling folk.</i> <i>See? I'm a cop.</i> There he is.
That guy's a cop!
That's him, right there!
That guy's a cop!
 Thank you for your help. Keep everyone up here.
 What are you gonna do?
 I'm going after him.
 Are you crazy? That guy's a cop.
 They're all animals.
 I beg to differ.
Jeffery, this doesn't have to end badly.
You show yourself now and prove to me that my son is safe, and my offer still holds.
I'll let you walk out of here.
You don't believe me?
Lou Ransone told me that it wasn't you who attacked him.
He said it was Lila Risco.
You hear me, Jeffery?
Detective Ransone isn't dead.
He survived. But you didn't know that, did you?
Otherwise you wouldn't have been squatting in his apartment.
And as for the lady lawyer, well, I figure, after seeing what she was capable of, that was just self-defense.
I know things seem dark right now and hopeless, but they're not hopeless.
And they're most definitely not dark!
Drop the gun, Jeffery.
Wow.
You lured me down here.
No, bitch, I chased you down here.
Now drop it, and tell me where my boy's at.
 How'd you even manage to pull this off?
 Easy.
I got no end of backup.
<i>You think you got me alone that night? No, sir.</i> <i>When you came at me, you came at everyone who loves me.</i> You didn't stand a chance.
And you got lucky that night.
If you hadn't picked up that gun, you'd be <i>dead</i> already!
And you'd still be peeing standing up.
Now drop it!
Don't make me shoot you again.
No?
That your firefighter husband?
Damn it!
 It wasn't loaded.
 What?
Where's Harry?
Tell me where he is!
Keep him alive. Keep him alive!
He's not breathing.
Where is he? Where is he?!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Tell me where he is!
I got no pulse.
Jeffery Hudson was an evil man, but he wasn't a stupid one.
He knew that this could only end one way.
He made sure it happened on his terms.
He knew exactly what he was doing, what he was making me do.
He was our last lead to finding Harry, and I-I played right into his hands.
You sent that man where he belongs; Straight to hell.
 It...
 No, listen.
That guy has no more moves.
It's up to us to find our son, and he's alive.
We have to believe that.
So this is everything we found on his body?
And from Ransone's car, yes.
What do these keys belong to?
 No idea. The answer is in those four days before we knew Hudson was missing. I think he was planning something.
Is there any way we can trace the movements of this phone?
It's a burner.
All right.
All right, so we know the video of Harry was made in Santa Clarita.
What was he doing there? Where was he going?
There was a report that the real estate office that Hudson worked out of was broken into a few days ago.
But several of the businesses out there  were also hit by looters.
 You think looters would hit a real estate office?
Did they happen to report any keys missing?
We need to find out if that real estate office has any listings in or around Santa Clarita.
<i>Not Santa Clarita. Next door. Valencia.</i> A housing development his company was refurbishing.
They never finished the project.
<i>It shut down because of the pandemic.</i> <i>It's been sitting empty ever since.</i> Thanks, baby.
Valencia. Bring those damn keys.
Who you calling?
Reinforcements.
 I'll send units.
 You do that.
Hey, I-I have keys.
We don't need keys.
All right. I want every one of these houses checked.
Every room. Every closet, crawl space, basement.
Every inch. Let's go!
Harry!
 Harry!
 Harry?
 Eddie...
 Yeah?
Harry!
 Harry.
 Harry?
Come on, Harry. You up here?
 Harry!
 Harry!
 Harry?
 Harry?
Harry!
 Harry!
 Harry!
Harry?
Harry!
Cap. Nothing upstairs, nothing in the crawl spaces.
The other houses are clear, too.
We can pull the FLIR tech. Or maybe  we can get some dogs out here.
 Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, or maybe this is a goose chase, and he's buried  out there somewhere.
 Michael!
Hey, I found this out back.
I don't know if it means anything.
Check for wet paint, guys.
Wet paint.
 Eddie.
 On it.
Wait, wait, wait! Harry!
Harry! All right, guys.
 Come on!
 Get a gurney in here!
 Athena, we got him! Hey, give me a knife or something!
Oh, come on.
 We got him, we got him, baby.
 Come on! Come on!
 Come on.
 I got him, I got him.
Okay, take it easy.
 We got you. We got you.
 Is he okay?
Pulse is weak.
 Get him out of here!
 Get him out, get him out.
We got you. We're gonna take care of you, okay?
 Make a hole! Make a hole!
 You okay?
Okay.
Okay, vitals are good. Everything seems good.
Mommy, did you get him?
Yeah, I got him, baby.
And now we got you, too.
Everything's okay now.
Everything's just fine.
Do you hear that?
Oh...AC! How I missed you.
The power's on, and not a moment too soon.
My leg was really not up for taking those stairs again.
Everything okay?
 It's from my brother.
 Oh...
 Oh, honey.
 Good.
<i>Violence and further property damage</i> <i>continue to ravage the area that has been called</i> <i>an autonomous zone...</i> <i>Hey, it's Chimney. Talk later.</i> Hi. Uh, I know that you're working, but something...
You know what, never mind.
We're good here.
I just wanted to make sure you're okay, too.
Love you.
Well, look at all of this glorious electricity.
Guess the power czar is out of business.
I gladly hand my power back to the power company.
Good, 'cause my phone is dead. You did a horrible job.
How's Harry doing?
As good as can be after being abducted by a lunatic and sealed in a wall to die.
Did Cap not come back with you?
He's still at the hospital with Athena.
Uh, so who's in charge till he gets back?
I am.
He did not say that.
Not in words.
You didn't catch that manly glance of unspoken confidence he flashed me before we left?
I did not.
He said that if he wasn't back by end of shift, that he would close it out in the morning.
Would you guys say this is the longest shift we've ever worked?
It definitely rates.
Harry's okay?
Oh, he's...he's safe.
 How are you?
 Ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow.
Then I'm good.
<i>- You're finally coming home?
 Yes.</i> And I cannot wait to see you.
Ah. Thought you'd be the first one out the door.
Christopher know you're coming?
Not yet.
I haven't figured out what I'm gonna say when I get home.
To Ana.
<i>since the five-day citywide blackout has ended.</i> <i>Thankfully, the power grid has returned to normal function.</i> <i>Utilities and essential technologies</i> <i>- have followed suit.
 Hi, honey.</i> I'm home.
<i>The hacker group initially claiming responsibility,</i> <i>and demanding a hefty ransom, has gone off-line,</i> <i>virtually scrubbing their existence from the Internet,</i> <i>leaving no trace...</i> Are you sure you don't want to go to bed, man?
I know you're exhausted.
I'm not tired.
<i>a very trying week. Many questions remain...</i> Now, you know you can talk to me, right?
There's nothing to talk about. I'm fine.
<i>But now that the power has at least been restored,</i> <i>Angelinos can begin to put their lives back together,</i> <i>piece by piece.</i> Okay, I think that is everything.
You ready to go see your daddy?
Yeah, I think he's gonna be happy to see you, too.
Mmm. You know, I thought that I would hate canned fruit, but it's not bad.
A little lime, some chili. Who'd have thought?
Yes!
It is all good.
Great, actually.
You didn't have to cook all this, though.
Let's make brownies next.
You know, I think we need to clean that kitchen first.
Maybe you should go home first.
I mean, you've been stuck here for days.
I'm sure you want to get back to your own place.
Have some time for yourself.
Right. Yeah.
But I am not going to leave you with the disaster in the kitchen.
A disaster.
I'm sorry. I know this place is such a wreck.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, but you've been working nonstop, so, you shouldn't have to come home to this mess...
Oh, I-I bet the dishwasher is working now, right?
You know what, I don't know what I miss more, whether it's the dishwasher or the refrigerator.
 Ana...
 Or the air conditioning.
It's probably the-the air conditioning, definitely.
Ana. Ana, stop.
We need to talk.
Those four words.
Maybe we should sit down.
Why?
You're fine.
You're not gonna pass out or anything, right?
Your heart rate is not going up?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I don't want you to...to panic when you think about me.
Or when you think about a future with me.
I can't...I can't take that.
I thought it would work.
I did. The idea of us.
Chris loves you so much.
I just thought...
That eventually you would, too?
 I should have said something sooner.
 Yeah.
You probably should have.
Well, I'm sorry about the mess, but I guess it's...it's your mess now.
 Right?
 Yeah, I guess it is.
You're...
You're an amazing father.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go say goodbye to him.
Adios.
Hey, Christopher.
Oh...
Is it ironic that all I want to do is close the blackout curtains and go to sleep?
Maddie.
Maddie?
Hey, what's up, Cap?
Ravi, what are you still doing here?
I was waiting for Cap to get back.
Yeah, he just called me in. Where is he?
Upstairs.
Hey, Cap, what's going on?
What couldn't you tell me over the...
Jee-Yun. What's my daughter doing here?
When I came back to wrap the shift, she was here.
 Maddie was here?
 Not Maddie.
The baby.
Her mother dropped her off.
What, with you?
I was the only one here.
I don't understand. Where's Maddie?
She's not here, Chim.
She asked me to give you this.
<i>Hi.</i> <i>I'm sure that you are confused,</i> <i>hurt, and, uh</i> <i>probably really scared.</i> <i>I don't know what to say.</i> <i>You don't need to go to the police</i> <i>or come looking for me.</i> <i>I'm not in any danger,</i> <i>and no one is making me do this.</i> <i>But Jee is not safe with me.</i> <i>Not now, and maybe...</i> I know that you're gonna take really good care of her.
And she's better off without me.
I love you.
<i>I love both of you.</i> <i>And I'm really sorry.</i>
 @@@@@@
How is it that every time the world seems to end, it ends some more?
"9-1-1" all new, Mondays.
This thing's hold on by a thread, Cap!
And watch other Fox shows, like "Our Kind of People," "The Big Leap," and "The Resident" on Fox.
<i>I love you.</i> <i>I love both of you.</i> <i>And I'm really sorry.</i> <i>in any danger</i> <i>and no one is making me do...</i> <i>need to go to the police.</i>  Chim, come on. <i>- Jee is not safe...</i>  Chim, I know you're home...I can hear you. <i>-Better...</i> <i>Better off without me.</i> <i>really good care of her,</i> <i>and she...</i> <i>You don't need to go to the police.</i> <i>any danger,</i> <i>and no one is making me...</i> <i>need to go to the police or come looking for me.</i> Chimney?
<i>come looking for me.</i>  Chimney?
 What is it, Buck?
<i>- Nobody's making me do this.</i>  What are you doing?
<i>need to go to the...</i> What do you think I'm doing? I'm trying to figure out what happened to your sister.
Nothing happened to her, Chim.
 She just left.
 That's it?
She just left? And that makes sense to you?
Listen, sometimes Maddie, um she likes to put distance between herself and her problems.
So what's the problem in this instance...
Is it me or is it her daughter?
You know what her problem is 'cause she told you.
She-she felt like Jee wasn't safe with her right now.
Here, let me show you something.
<i>or come looking for me.</i> <i>I'm not in any danger and no one</i> <i>is making me do this.</i> Did you see that? Did you see that, right there?
See what?
She shakes her head as she's looking right into the camera.
It's like she's telling me to believe the opposite of what she's saying, almost like-like there's someone making her do it.
That sounds crazy, doesn't it?
 No.
 It does, and I know it does.
But I just-I just need to know. I just...
I need to make sure there's no one out there  that's trying to hurt her.
 No. No, Chimney, Chimney, no one wants to hurt Maddie.
Doug did.
Doug is dead.
Is he, though?
I mean, did you see a body? Did anybody see a body?
Come on.
The day after Maddie disappeared, she withdrew $20,000 out of a settlement account from a bank in Oxnard.
Doesn't it sound like maybe somebody's trying to coerce her?
 No.
 That money came from Doug's estate.
You know he would have considered it his.
Do you really believe anything you're saying right now?
I really don't want to hate her, Buck.
I don't want to believe that she could do this to us, to me, to Jee-Yun.
Just got to give her time.
She's gonna come home.
How do you know that?
'Cause I know my sister.
Yeah, well, I did, too. Now I'm not so sure, which is why I have to keep going back to this.
This is the only thing that she left me with.
Not the only thing.
Jee, I'm coming.
Okay, everyone switch places.
Harry, I'm gonna talk to your mom and dad a bit, and then I'll give them right back.
You okay out here for a second?
 Can I have my phone?
 Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Be right back, okay?
<i>So, how's he doing?</i> Has he said anything about what happened yet?
We're still building a rapport. How's he been at home?
Uh, it's hard to tell.
Uh, he hasn't opened up there, either.
Oh, he barely looks at me when I come over to see him.
He still hasn't been back to the house yet?
No. After the...kidnapping, he wanted to stay at Michael's place, which, of course, was understandable.
Like you said, these things take time.
Mm-hmm. In general, yes, but in this case, I would encourage you to bring him back to the house sooner rather than later.
Even if he doesn't want to be there?
Allowing him to stay away is telling him that you agree the house is scary.
Instead, what we want to say is that the man who took him is scary, and that man is gone.
It's important to signal to him that the world he's always known is still safe.
How do we do that?
You know, bring him back to the house?
Uh, should you be there?
You should make it as normal as possible.
If Harry picks up on your anxiety, then he'll be more anxious, too.
 All right, we'll...
 We'll think about it.
<i>Can you believe it?</i> The prodigal daughter has returned.
She's back? Really?
I thought that was just a rumor.
She walked in those doors and immediately took over a priority one.
<i>We have an armed suspect in play, two innocents.</i> <i>Readying to enter.</i> Copy, 19.
Um, that's not Maddie.
 Claudette Collins.
 Rescue 133, hold position.
 Suspect is still in the house.
 She used to work here years ago until she was poached by Valley, but I lured her back.
Homeowner is in the rear bedroom and non-responsive.
Once I give the all-clear, you've got French doors off the back.
<i>Copy. 133 is standing by.</i> Home invasion robbery.
The homeowner and his grandson managed to hide, but it sounds like Grandad's having a heart attack.
Lonnie, the paramedics are real close, I promise, but they can't enter the house yet.
 Do you still hear the intruder? <i>- Yes, yes, I can hear him.</i>  And what about your grandpa? Is he breathing? <i>-No, no.</i> <i>He's dying. I think he's dying.-</i> Okay, honey.
 You've got your earbuds in,  right? <i>- Yes, yes.</i> Good. You're gonna need both your hands. I'm gonna  talk you through  doing compressions. <i>- No, no, I-I can't.</i> <i>- They're gonna hear.</i>  You can. You can do this.
Put one hand on top of the other and press the heel of your palm against the center of your grandpa's chest.
<i>- Okay.</i>  Now, keep your elbows locked.
You're gonna push hard as you can.
You want to see his chest go down, over and over.
Don't call out. I'll get you started. You just huff and puff on my count. And don't stop till I tell you.
 Ready? <i>- Yeah.</i> One, two. One, two.
One, one. One, one. Two, two.
Good, good. Keep pushing, Lonnie. You're doing great.
Five-Adam-19, suspect in the front study, hard right as you enter the house.
<i>- Opy, Dispatch. We're going in.
 C</i> Lonnie, the police are coming in.
 It's gonna be loud. <i>- I can hear them coming.</i> Don't be scared by the noise, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>  Are you still pushing?
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>  Good.
<i>I think he's coming closer.</i> Five-Adam-19, you need to go now.
<i>All right, team, on me. Let's go.</i> <i>Go, go, go, go, go, go! Move, move, move!</i> <i>Five-Adam-19.</i> <i>Suspect in custody. House is secure.</i> Copy, 19. Sending rescue in.
133, suspect's in custody.
 You're clear to enter. <i>- Copy that.</i> <i>He's right over there.</i> <i>This is 133.</i> <i>Patient's stable with normal rhythm.</i> <i>- Prepping for transport.</i>  Copy, 133.
 Lonnie, are you still there? <i>- I'm here.</i> Paramedics tell me your grandpa's heartbeat is back.
 You did real good. Yeah, you did real good. <i>-Thank you.</i> That's all right, honey. You're welcome.
Okay. All right. A little...a little oxygen, please.
Come on. Come on. Social distance, please.
Thank you. Here you go.
Wow. That was really something.
Just doing my job.
Guess they put you right back to work.
Didn't even give you time to put on your uniform.
Claudette doesn't  wear the polo.
 Mm-mmm.
 Oh. She doesn't?
 No.
Does it look like I'm FaceTiming with these people?
Can't believe you remember that.
Seriously, though, I couldn't look this corny and do what I do.
I'm just talking about the shirt, so no offense.
 Hi, Claudette.
 Linda Bates?
I did not expect to see you.
I had ten bucks you'd wash out in six months.
 Which you still owe me.
 Whatever.
 It's good to see you.
 You, too.
And I don't mind losing ten bucks.
 Which you still owe me.
 Okay.
Everyone seems really excited to have you here. May Grant.
You may grant me what? That coffee?
What? Oh, no. It's-it's my name. Unless you want it.
Yeah. This is a latte?
 Uh, yeah.
 Yeah, this'll work. Josh, I like your interns. They come prepared.
 Oh, I'm not an intern.
 May's been a dispatcher for almost a year.
Oh. So we're hiring fetuses now?
Is there nutmeg in the breakroom?
 Cinnamon, I think.
 Ugh.
It's a good thing I'm back.
 Yes, it is.
 Need some spice up in here.
Good to see you. You, too.
Hey, at least she didn't steal your lunch money.
Why do I feel like that's next?
Oh, uh, let me fix your bow.
 Mom. It's fine. No one cares.
 Cassie, honey, where are your parents watching from? We'll find 'em.
Can't make it.
 They have a big open house today. Oh.
Well, I'll send them copies of all the pictures.
It doesn't mean they don't care.
Yeah. I mean, they obviously donated money.
Really. It's fine.
Besides, you're going to lunch with us after the game, right?
So we would've had to ditch 'em.
Makayla's absolutely right.
 You're coming to lunch with us.
 Yeah.
Get together.
Give the float about a 20-foot lead. Then you can go.
You guys enjoy your big day.
You don't know it, but you're peaking at 18.
Yo, Mr. Foster. Uh, could you get that?
Yeah, Mr. Foster, go long. MVP! MVP!
MVP!
Thank you.
Blue Jays!
MAN Let's give it up for our Jays!
Really? Really?
Come on.
One way or the other. Right or left.
No, no, no. No.
What's your exact location, sir?
911. What's your emergency?
<i>Someone just drove into the parade.</i> <i>- They hit a bunch of people.</i>  We have been notified, and help is on the way. Thank you, ma'am.
Folks, we have a mass-casualty event.
Pulling the calls into one file. Linda, there should be traffic police already on the scene for the parade.
Get them on the radio, ask for a preliminary count on victims.
118, 133, <i>147, respond to major traffic collision,</i> corner of La Vista and Bradley.
Vehicle versus pedestrians, reports of multiple injuries.
 Also, notify the battal...
 Battalion Chief Nine, we have a multiple-injury T-C, corner of La Vista and Bradley. Dispatching units now, sir.
This is Captain Nash, 118. Dispatch, send an additional four task forces and five RA units to the scene.
All right, pull 'em, right here.
Sir, can you hear me?
No belt, no airbags.
You think he did it on purpose?
Callers told dispatch he was honking like crazy just before the crash.
Doesn't sound like somebody who's trying to hurt people.
Tag him and keep moving.
Let's go.
Hey, you all right?
 Miss?
 Eddie.
Are you okay? Miss?
Ah...
She's gone.
Paramedics over here!
Let's go.
We'll roll over on three.
One, two, three.
Got a weak pulse.
Airway's clear.
Multiple fractures, severe abrasions.
She's lost a lot of blood.
 I'm opening a line.
 Yeah.
Honey?
What's your name?
 Makayla.
 Okay, Makayla.
 Makayla.
 We're gonna take care of you.
Uneven pupillary response, probable TBI. She needs to be on the next ride out of here. Hey, guys!
Hey! Hey!
 I need your help.
 Come on.
 What is it?
 Mr. Foster's trapped.
Hey, Cap!
I tried to pull him out, but-but I can't.
Okay, it's a good thing you left him where he is.
 What's your name?
 Tino. That's Mr. Foster.
Okay. Tino, just give us some space, okay?
Word has it you're Mr. Foster.
 Hugh.
 Okay. I'm Bobby. Is Tino one of your students?
 Science.
 Oh, that's my favorite subject.
Listen, can you squeeze my finger?
I can't feel a thing. Is it bad?
Well, it's tough to say anything at this point, but we're gonna get you stabilized, and we're gonna get you out of here. Does that sound good?
Okay.
Got a probable spinal injury. We're gonna have to extract him really gently to avoid any further damage.
That's easier said than done. He's tangled in there good.
Okay, we do it slow and we do it safe.
You got it. Let's go!
Makayla! Makayla! Makayla!
 Makayla! Makayla!
 Let's go.
 Makayla, honey! Makayla!
 Makayla!
We're looking for our daughter.
 Makayla? Yes. She's a cheerleader.
She was riding on the back of the convertible.
Your daughter was injured in the accident, but she's stable and already on her way to the hospital.
Which hospital? All casualties are being rushed to First Presbyterian.
What about her friend Cassie Shaw?
She was with our daughter.
There was another girl.
She didn't make it.
I'm sorry.
<i>It's been months.</i> <i>They haven't let me out on a single call.</i> <i>I don't think my captain's as nice as yours.</i> Uh-huh.
<i>All I do is roll hoses,</i> <i>I make coffee, I clean.</i>  <i>His isn't being a firefighter.
 T.</i> <i>- I-It's being a maid.</i>  I could use a maid.
Okay, what is so interesting about your mail?
Seeing as how you've never actually lived in a place where your name is on the lease, <i>this is called a bill. You pay them.</i>  Ha, ha, ha. <i>- This one keeps the lights on.</i> <i>And this one makes sure your niece doesn't freeze at night.</i> I forgive you for being snappish.
<i>I know you're not irritated with me.</i> I don't know. I've got plenty of irritated to go around.
<i>Howie, maybe it's time you went back to work.</i> <i>I would help take care of Jee-Yun, and I know.</i> <i>Anne and John would, too. They said so.</i> My head wouldn't be in the right place, not with Maddie out there with all of this.
<i>Maddie just needs some time, bro.</i> <i>I'm sure she'll come back when she's ready.</i> Did Buck put you up to this call?
'Cause this dialogue is starting to sound really familiar.
<i>Uh, he...may have mentioned</i> <i>you...you could use some bucking up.</i> Oh, believe me, I've already been bucked up, Albert.
I don't need any more...
<i>What is it?</i> It's a letter from my health insurance saying that they paid for Jee-Yun's ER visit.
<i>Jee-Yun went to the ER?</i> Uh, this is the first I'm hearing about it.
Says it was a day before Maddie left.
Hey, C-collar. Come on, let's go.
 Here we go. Got him, Buck?
 He's good to go.
All right. Tino seems pretty loyal.
 He hasn't left your side.
 Tino, you're still here?
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere, Mr. F.
Ah, a football player who likes science.
Thing is, he doesn't.
It's kind of throwing me.
I don't get it, Tino. I thought you hated me. You forget I almost got you kicked off the team for poor grades?
Yeah, well, you got me to bring those grades up.
You were pushing me, for my own sake.
I'm not gonna play football forever, right?
You just hang in there, all right?
We're gonna get you out of there.
All done, Cap. All right, let's get you out of there, Hugh.
Uh, Cap?
Do we know what that truck was carrying?
Whoa.
Chlorine gas! Everybody get back!
We have a hazardous materials release at the parade site.
We need to issue a shelter-in-place notification to every phone within a quarter-mile radius.
 People need to stay indoors.
 This is Los Angeles 911.
This is Los Angeles 911.
We have an incident involving a hazardous materials release in your area, and advise you to shelter in place until further notice.
Everybody back! Chlorine gas!
I want everybody in breathing apparatus.
Put rubber bands on the sleeves of your turnouts, protect your skin.
Evacuate this area. Anybody who can walk, I want 'em back a thousand feet. I want the fire inside this truck knocked down and I want a stream of fog on top of that smoke.
We still have a victim pinned down and I want to keep that smoke away from him.
We haven't forgotten about you, Hugh.
This is Los Angeles 911. We have an incident involving a hazardous materials release in your area and advise you to shelter in place unless further notice.
I'm sorry? I don't know what the material is.
What time is your son coming?
I think this should probably be cleared up by then.
Ma'am, you will be notified when this incident is over. You have a good day.
You never guess a time, or any other facts, to people.
Read them the script, and then move on to the next call.
Is that clear?
Buck, how much longer until you get him out?
Almost there, Cap.
 Okay. Good to go! Okay, guys, let's get him out of there.
One, two, three. Up.
Nice and easy. All the way up.
Gently now.
All right, Hugh. After this, you're gonna have a pretty interesting science class to teach, and I'm guessing, some pretty attentive students.
Thank you.
Fire's contained, Cap.
<i>Harry,</i> did you tell your mother where these tomatoes came from?
Hmm.
The roof garden.
Harry helped Ms. Wallace plant these a few months ago.
 Hmm.
 Literally the fruits of your labor.
 Do you like 'em?
 They're all right.
 Can I be excused? I have homework.
 Yeah, sure.
I need a drink.
You want one?
So much for not sharing our anxiety with him.
Worst parents ever, or just honorable mention?
We got him back in one piece.
Yeah.
Look, we have been through plenty before.
We'll figure this one out, too.
Yeah.
Uh, uh, Dr. Green, excuse me?
Um, the front desk told me who you were. I apologize.
I'm Howard Han, and this is Jee-Yun, who I think you may know already.
 Uh, I'm her father.
 What can I do for you, Mr. Han?
I received this form in the mail from my health insurance, and I was just hoping that you could explain it to me.
All right, if you have any billing questions, you...
No, no, it's-it's not a billing question. Uh, uh, it says right here that my daughter was brought in for an ER visit, and-and that you treated her.
Yes. How is she?
Uh, the baby is fine, but her mother is not.
Uh, I'm kind of losing it here.
I-I-I...I just need to know what happened to her.
I think maybe you should speak to Jee-Yun's mother about this.
No, no, no, I-I can't speak to Maddie about it because the day after she brought Jee-Yun in to see you, she left, and I-I don't know where she is.
Please. Um...
She left me a message saying that the baby wasn't safe with her.
Which, if you knew her, that's just it's crazy because she's a great mother.
She just doesn't know it yet.
Or she doesn't believe it, I guess. Uh...
You see, she-she...she has postpartum, and it's been really tough on her.
And I know that she's tired.
I mean, we both are, but, uh, she's had to do most of it alone.
You see, uh, the day that she brought Jee-Yun to see you...
That's the week that the world went crazy, more than usual.
Uh, see, I'm a firefighter, and I was on call the whole time, so, uh, I didn't get to go home, and, uh...
I really didn't check on her a lot. I tried.
I tried a lot, but the power was out, and the phones were down half the time.
And there was a giraffe on Hollywood Boulevard.
I'm-I'm so sorry.
I'm-I'm not crazy. I'm-I'm just completely in the dark here, and I just need to know what's going on with her.
With the both of them. That's all.
Please?
Evidently, Ms. Buckley was bathing your daughter, and Jee-Yun slipped under the water.
 Well, f-for how long?
 Probably a few seconds.
But Ms. Buckley couldn't be sure, which is why she brought Jee-Yun in to be examined.
Just to be safe.
Yeah, that's right.
I-I'm so sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
 Best of luck to you.
 Thank you.
Can I talk to you a second?
Of course. What's up?
So...Claudette.
Claudette...
You've known her for a while, right?
Yeah, we came up together.
 Has she said anything to you?
 About what?
 About me.
 No. Why?
It seems like maybe I've done something to rub her the wrong way?
 What do you mean?
 It just feels like ever since she got here, she's had it in for me.
 Ever since she got here?
 Yeah.
You mean since...this morning?
Has it really only been a day?
Not even a full a day. May,  what's going on?
 I don't know.
I mean, I know she's a legend or whatever, and everybody loves her.
But I think she hates me.
May, you're imagining things.
Am I? She took over one of my calls and kind of snapped at me.
I'm sure it wasn't personal.
Sure felt personal.
Look...
Claudette's a big personality.
But she's got an even bigger heart.
Have you tried talking to her?
I think that would be a bad idea.
 Do you want me to talk to her?
 No, no.
Then it just looks like I'm running to the boss.
Might just make things worse.
Uh, it would for sure make it worse if Claudette heard she had a boss.
I'm kidding. My advice?
Talk to her, just tell her how you feel.
I'm sure there's just a misunderstanding, and the two of you can work it out.
Not my favorite day. Yeah.
 This one was brutal.
 Yeah.
You did great out there.
War zones are my thing.
Excuse me. Henrietta Wilson?
We're Makayla Tannor's parents...The cheerleader who was injured?
 Makayla. Of course.
 We just wanted to say thank you for s-saving our daughter's life.
I assure you, it-it wasn't just me. It was...
Thank you.
Thank you for giving us back our little girl.
Of course.
You're welcome.
Did you guys know the other girl that was riding with her?
Cassie. The girls have been best friends since they were little.
Cassie spent as much time at our house as Makayla did.
Oh, God. How are we gonna tell her?
It's gonna be okay, baby.
Oh, God. Cassie's parents.
 Lynn and Tommy.
 Ellen.
Jack.
This can't be happening, can it?
No. No, it can't.
 It's a nightmare. They said our baby is here.
Have you seen her? Have you seen Cassie?
No.
They said we have to...identify her.
Would you like me to help you find you a nurse?
Yeah. Yeah.
Is that her blood?
Is that our baby's blood?
Did she say anything?
Sh...She was gone when we got on the scene. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
We should have been there.
We're never there.
 We missed her whole life.
 I want to see my baby.
I want to see her.
Why isn't anyone helping us?
Why don't you let me show you where she is?
 I can take you.
 Okay.
Oh, my, God. Makayla?
She's in recovery.
Thank you, Lord.
Oh.
It's not her.
It's not her.
What?
That's not our daughter.
That's Makayla.
That's Makayla.
Hey, Claudette, do you have a minute?
I got to get home and feed my cat.
You have a cat?
No.
So I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
 Oh?
 Yeah. I mean, what happened today?
What happened today was a learning opportunity.
Yes. Exactly. I'm so glad you see it that way.
I mean, I know you're a lot more experienced at this than I am.
I know I look young, and I am.
But I'm also good at this, and I've been trained by some very talented dispatchers, and I've learned important things from all of them.
And when I make a mistake, it's usually just once.
I learn from it.
Apology accepted.
 No. Um...
 Oh, and next time, you don't have to tell me how good you are.
Just show me.
Good night.
Hey, thank you for doing that.
 How did it go?
 It's a complicated question.
Where are the Tannors?
They're in with their daughter.
Except they're not.
What do you mean?
Bobby?
Hey. I'm sorry. I'm still at work.
I saw the news about the parade. You all right?
Yeah, I just have an insane amount of paperwork to finish.
<i>How about you? How did today go with Harry?</i> It's a process.
<i>I sure could use sinking into the arms of my man.</i> I will bring them home to you as soon as I can.
<i>I'll see you soon.</i> Oh.
Dental records confirmed it. You were right.
The girl in the morgue is Makayla Tannor, not Cassie Shaw.
Oh, God.
The Tannors are in there now with the Shaw's daughter, thinking it's theirs.
I'm going to break it to them now.
Actually, would it be okay if I told them?
Hen. Are you sure?
I think I owe them that.
Mr. and Mrs. Tannor?
Please, come on in.
It-it might be best if we, uh if we speak in the hall.
We'll be right outside that door.
I, um...
I...
I-I have no idea how to even...tell you this.
What? Is there something wrong with one of her tests?
No. Uh we made a terrible mistake. I...
I made a terrible mistake.
The girl in there, when-when I...when I asked her her name, she kept saying "Makayla." But she wasn't telling me her name.
She was she was only thinking about her friend.
 And so, we just assumed...
 Wait.
Wait. Are-are you telling us the girl in this room is not our daughter?
Mr. And Mrs. Tannor, I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
Makayla succumbed to her injuries at the scene.
 No. No.
 The girl in the room is Cassie Shaw.
 Your daughter is downstairs.
 No.
No!

Uh, o-okay.
It was during the blackout. There was some kind of accident.
Maddie was bathing her and the baby slipped under the water.
That's what she meant when she said.
Jee-Yun wasn't safe with her.
 But Jee-Yun is fine.
 Yes, exactly, she's fine.
But Maddie is out there somewhere, beating herself up because she lost grip of a slippery child.
She needs to know that this wasn't her fault.
And she'll figure that out if you give her time.
Time? She needs me. I'm going after her.
Well, sh-she said sh-she didn't want you to do that, right?
Buck, you're not listening.
She exiled herself because she thinks she's a danger to the baby.
I can't leave her alone like that, believing that, thinking the worst of herself. She needs to know.
Know what? That you love her?
That you support her? Chim, she knows.
What she needs is time, and she will come home.
Why weren't you surprised?
When I told you that Jee-Yun almost drowned, you didn't even blink.
It wasn't until I said that I was going after Maddie...
Did you know?
 Ch-Chim, Chimney...
 She told you? Is that it?
She called you and you already knew about this because she told you?
Where is she, Buck?
I-I...I don't know.
 She wouldn't tell me.
 Eight...days.
You have waited eight days while you have seen the hell I've been going through, and you didn't tell me?
She-she said she was fine, you know?
She-she just needed to figure some stuff out.
And she-she was more worried about you.
She-she asked me to check in on you and Jee-Yun and make sure that you're okay.
I am not okay.
Athena?
Athena?
 Athena. Hey.
 Oh.
Sorry. Didn't hear you come in.
It's all right. Looks like you've been busy.
What happened?
He was in our house.
I know.
This is the house where where my babies grew up, where they said their first words, took their first steps.
This patio was full of memories of barbecues and birthday parties.
And now it's the place where that man came in and snatched my son!
He's gone now.
He can't hurt this family anymore.
I'm supposed to bring Harry back here, tell him he's safe, that this is still his home.
How do I do that when I'm not sure it'll ever feel like home again?
Hey, hey, come here.
<i>Well, there's nothing wrong with his aim.</i> Ah.
He got you good.
Look, I get why he's mad. What am I supposed to do?
She begged me not to tell him we talked.
 She's your sister.
 Thought I could help them both.
Could, uh, convince her to come home and stop him from spiraling out of control.
 Mm.
 Kind of feels like I failed on both fronts.
You were always gonna fail.
Well, that's dark.
Look, you love Maddie, and you love Chimney, and you're the guy who likes to fix things.
But maybe this isn't something you can fix.
He-he kept on saying that, you know, she could be in trouble, she needs our help.
But I know she's gonna be okay.
He just doesn't know her the way I do.
Or you don't know her the way he does.
When you think of your sister, you see this person you've always looked up to.
The woman who's taken care of you.
But maybe that's not who she is right now. This time, maybe she's the one who needs taking care of.
You think he's gonna forgive me?
No.
Kidding. I'm kidding.
Maybe.
 Ice goes on the eye, bud.
 Okay, I got it.
Hey, just don't tell Dad.
He'll freak about how much sugar I'm giving you right now.
 He won't care.
 Since when?
Since I got kidnapped by a crazy freak.
Look, this ice cream's not just for you.
I had a pretty crappy day at work yesterday.
A new dispatcher. Old dispatcher, really.
I think she has it in for me.
 She was really getting on my nerves.
 That's my job.
Well, you haven't been talking.
So I guess someone else felt like they needed to pick up the slack.
Mom and Dad won't stop hovering.
"What are you watching?" "What are you reading?" Pretending like they're not checking in on my damaged mental state.
You were already pretty damaged.
Hey, I just...They're worried, okay?
They probably feel a little guilty that it happened.
Yeah, well, they should. Dad was standing right there, and he didn't even notice the guy walking off with me.
And Mom...
She was the reason the guy was there.
I know I'm not supposed to be mad at them, but...
Hey, no. Be mad at them, if that's how you feel.
Just don't bottle up your emotions and put on a happy face for other people.
That never works, and it will never make you feel better.
Okay.
Tell me how nice you were to that mean lady at work.
Way too nice.
Yeah? Well, there's always tomorrow.
Yeah, there is.
There you go.
Need anything else? Game device? Pretzels? Magazine?
All right. Let's go find Mommy.
Just make one quick stop first.
Seriously, Chimney?
You were gonna call me on your way out of town?
Or leave you a heartfelt voice mail.
Actually, I was calling to see if we could come by right now.
 You're really doing this.
 I'm really doing it.
You're not here to try and talk me out of it, are you?
Hell, no. I'm here to see if you wanted a driving partner.
What would your wife have to say about that?
After yesterday, I think she'd understand.
Yeah. Eddie told me about that.
So many life lessons.
They just keep coming, don't they?
I'd like to go just a few days without learning anything, anything at all.
Right?
So do you even know where you're going?
Nope. I know that she made a withdrawal from some bank in Oxnard.
I thought I'd start there.
Oxnard.
Some really, really important journeys start there, don't they?
Yeah, I heard that.
Are you sure you're coming back?
Not without her.
Then you go find her.
You go find her.
Be safe, okay?
I do. Hence the request, rebar-skull.
Karen's a lucky woman.
So's Maddie.
Let's hope she sees it that way.

Okay, so, so, what did you do to-to make it right?
Nothing.
Someone else did.
A surgeon. She had gallstones.
That's why she kept scowling at me.
She was in pain.
So maybe you might want to consider that not everything is about you.
Yeah.

Follow my lead and try not to step on my toes.
Lucky for you I'm an excellent dancer.
Same goes for you, probie.
LAFD. We got a call from this address.
For security reasons, most residential doors open inwards, which is why the hinges aren't on the outside and you can't just saw them off.
Come on.
Why don't you do the honors.
Craig? LAFD here.
Help me. Oh.
Uh, nice swing.
I have some notes.
All right, sir, we're here.
I can't move.
Okay, did-did you hurt your head or your neck in any way?
No.
We're gonna help you sit up so that you can breathe a little easier.
What are you doing?
Getting into position to lift the patient.
On my side?
Okay.
Let's get him upright and relieve the pressure on his diaphragm.
I'm just gonna...
Stabilize your neck.
Did I have a stroke or something?
Based on the lack of facial drooping, your speech, there's no impairment, I'd rule that out.
Then why can't I move?
I'm gonna try to figure that out.
No sign of trauma.
Airways patent.
Pulse feels strong.
BP's 110/70.
Oxygen is 93.
I'm gonna lift your arm for you, and then you keep it raised as long as you can after I let it go.
 Okay?
 Okay.
Oh, God, what's happening to me?
I'm gonna test your nerve response.
Do you feel any pressure?
So much pressure.
I just wanted to get fit like everybody else, but I never thought it would kill me.
N-No, like pressure from my touch.
Oh. Yeah, I can feel that.
Craig, have you been working out a lot? Is this something new?
I-I just got the Narcissus.
The exercise mirror out there.
There's a mirror called Narcissus?
Feels like someone didn't read to the end of that story.
<i>Battering ram</i> positively must be returned to the bottom compartment, handle facing outwards.
That way, you can open the door with one hand and grab the ram with the other in one fluid motion, like so.
This motorized gurney is awesome.
The B shift guys never let me use it.
It's 'cause it's not a toy. Stop playing with it.
Probie, I said stop playing with...!
What did you do?
<i>BOBBY Where's that gurney, Buck?</i> Uh...small technical issue with that, Cap.
<i>What kind of issue?</i> Uh, bringing in the stair chair ASAP.
Keep your hands to yourself.
<i>300 sit-ups?</i> <i>Is that too much?</i> Yeah, I-I'd call that excessive.
What we have here is a severely pinched nerve in the neck, from overexertion and straining, which caused his body to spasm and freeze.
That's why you can't move.
But I assure you, it's all temporary.
Let's push ten milligrams of morphine to relax his muscles en route to the ER.
Running a line.
Go for it.
Wheels could probably use some WD-40 when we get back to the station.
Have you seen these workout mirrors?
So crazy.
 Stay focused.
 Super crazy.
You get distracted and people die.
I'm gonna die.
No, you're gonna take it easy, okay?
No more crazy workouts trying to fit in.
Just do you.
I've definitely learned my lesson.
Wow. You guys are pretty jacked.
What kind of workout do you do?
I give up.
<i>Harry still acting weird?</i> Barely says a word.
Have you talked to him?
I was hoping he might open up to you.
So mother-daughter mani-pedi day was a bribe.
 You're fishing.
 Well, have you? Talked to him?
Oh, hell no.
Oh, sorry. Linda asked me to cover her shift.
That would be a no.
Now that you got rent to pay, I would think an extra shift here and there is a good thing.
Well, it normally would be, but Claudette will be working.
Hard pass.
Oh. New dispatcher?
A transfer. Everyone loves her.
And you don't.
Honestly, I think it's the other way around.
I don't think she likes me very much.
Impossible.
What's not to like?
I know.
She's always giving me a hard time.
Constantly.
Wait a second.
This woman is picking on you?
No.
Kinda, but it's fine.
Oh, no, it's not fine.
How long has this been going on?
I don't know, couple weeks.
A grown woman has been harassing you at work for weeks now, and I'm just now hearing about it?
Why are neither of my children talking to me?
Do I need to come down there and have a word with Miss Claudette?
That's another hard pass.
She already thinks I'm a child, so having my mommy come stick up for me isn't going to help.
Okay, fine.
But just say the word. You know I always got your back.
Mm-hmm.
Now...about Harry.
<i>Thank you for coming down, Mr. Grant.</i> <i>It's Nash. I'm his stepfather.</i> Ah. Our files have been a mess since the cyberattacks.
We had Harry give us a parent's phone number, and we never...
Ah. He had you call me.
Okay, so what did he do?
I want to be clear.
We're all very sensitive to the fact that Harry has been through a significant trauma.
We've done our best to be patient, but his acting out has reached the point...
 Acting out?
 He has been ill-tempered.
Not turning in his homework, using expletives with his teachers.
But now we have moved past the point of understanding, and we need to take action.
Harry is being suspended one week.
One week for being ill-tempered?
Not exactly.
You're mad.
I am surprised.
The Harry that principal was talking about is not the Harry that I know.
Cursing, talking back and now punching another kid?
He's a jackhole.
Well, Harry, I think your parents are gonna want a better explanation than that.
I think you might want to reconsider the language.
Do they have to know about this?
Harry, we're pals, but you got suspended.
I think your father's gonna notice when you don't go to school tomorrow.
Well, can't I just stay at the firehouse?
 It's just for a week.
 No.
And I know that's why you got them to call me because you thought you could get me to cover for you.
They just don't get me.
Not like you.
Yeah, that's not gonna work either.
So you're gonna tell them?
No, you are.
♪ What are you doing?
Um, I was just checking my lipstick before I started work.
911. What's your damage?
<i>Okay.</i> We got a long list today.
First we'll head west towards the walnut trees.
They're way overgrown.
That list looks more like a novel.
 Maybe we should split up.
 Nah.
A lot of these are two-man jobs.
Well, 'cause one of the men is old.
It's gonna be blazing hot today, and I'd rather not risk my delicate skin because you need someone holding your hand while trimming some bushes.
Did you just call me old?
No.
Your birth certificate does that already.
I mean, I got no trouble working alone.
I know what I'm doing. Don't you?
I don't think the boss would like if we...
We each take an even share, and if you finish yours before I finish mine, I'll clean the carts.
You might need a nap by then.
Fine.
As long as we get the job done.
Just be real careful trimming those high branches!
Can't hear you!
I'm too busy winning!
Can you speak?
If there's any way you can speak.
They're on a cell phone.
See if you can get their GPS coordinates.
We're trying to get your location now.
Please don't hang up.
We're pinging your phone to see if we can get a more exact location.
Griffith Park recreation area.
We have you in the general vicinity of Crystal Springs Drive.
Can you tell me the nature of your emergency?
You don't have to speak; Just try to touch one of the numbers on your phone if you can hear me.
Okay.
Touch a button if the answer is yes.
Do you need police?
Do you need medical assistance?
<i>Are you injured?</i> Truck 118 with rescue, respond to Griffith Park, Crystal Springs Drive.
Unknown individual in need of medical aid.
Unknown injury. <i>118 en route.</i> <i>Do you have a more specific location?</i> Copy, 118. Working on it.
Fire and paramedics are on the way.
Can you still hear me?
Hello.
<i>118, still have an open cellular line.</i> Just hearing faint sounds of traffic <i>and a semi-truck's horn.</i> <i>Distant but not that distant.</i> Subject is possibly near the I-5 freeway.
<i>Dispatch, 118 on scene.</i> Are we sure about this?
118, it did not sound like a prank.
They're out there.
<i>All right, let's spread out and search.</i> LAFD!
Can you hear us?
 Fire Department!
 Fire Department!
LAFD! Anyone out here?
Anybody see anything?
 Nothing, Cap!
 Sorry, Cap!
<i>- Nothing here!</i>  Wait, wh-who said that?
<i>Who said, "Sorry, Cap"?</i> <i>Firefighter Diaz.</i> I didn't say that in the radio.
<i>Yeah, but I heard it anyway, on the victim's phone.</i> Everybody, with Eddie.
Everybody, with Eddie!
Got a visual!
<i>- Dispatch, we found him.-</i>  Okay.
Oh, God.
Chain saw must've hit a knot to cause it to kick back so hard.
Wedged it into his collarbone.
Okay, dispatch, patient located.
<i>E couldn't speak because he hadH chain saw blade in his throat. a.</i> Buck, Ravi, we're gonna need to remove  that blade from the motor.
 Oh, I-I don't think...
Probie, if you're gonna vomit, do it somewhere else.
Copy.
Alive. Barely.
His heart rate's elevated.
Blade must've nicked his carotid, but at least it's giving us just enough pressure to prevent him from bleeding out immediately.
Okay, I'm gonna bolus a liter of normal saline.
Okay, Buck, I've got the weight.
You got the disassemble when you're done there.
BP's dropping, 90/60.
He doesn't have very long.
 Set?
 He got it.
All right, good to go!
Oh, my God!
Is he alive? Yeah. And stable.
The chain saw did a number on his neck, though.
I knew we shouldn't have split up.
I can't believe I let him get to me.
Don't worry. We're gonna take good care of him.
And we're gonna drive very carefully.
<i>118 in transport.</i> <i>Victim is still alive.</i> Hallelujah.
There's no shame in asking for help.
Better than letting someone die on your watch.
It was humiliating.
She just walked over, plugged herself into my call and took it over.
Well, did she save the guy?
Not the point.
I could've saved him if she'd let me do my job.
But she didn't even give me the chance.
You just need to learn how to stand your ground.
Bullies don't back down unless you make them.
The only reason she's dishing it out is because she knows you'll take it.
I don't think I should be taking advice from someone who got suspended from school.
Harry, did you tell Mom and Dad  you were coming over here?
 No. Why?
There something you forgot to tell your parents?
I can't believe you told them.
I wouldn't have had to if you told them yourself  like we agreed.
 Harry, you just can't take off like that.
Not after...
We were worried sick about you, man.
A-And you.
You don't call us to tell us that he's here?
I didn't know he was on the I am.
I didn't say anything because I knew you guys were just gonna get mad.
No one's getting mad.
We just want to know what happened.
Why did you hit someone?
Yeah, is something going on at that school?
 With this boy?
 We know you're going through a lot, but you got to talk to us.
Let us help you.
I don't really want to talk to either of you.
 Hey, Harry.
 What? You want me to be honest, right?
Yeah, but I don't want you to be disrespectful.
Fine. Sorry. Are we done?
No, we're not.
After everything you've been through...
I only went through anything because of you two!
 Dad just stood there and let it happen.
 What?
And Jeffery was only there because of you.
But you were too busy being a cop.
Too busy to protect me.
 Harry, that's not fair.
 But it's true.
Because that's what she cares about.
Being a cop.
Jeffery was right about you.
You're a terrible mother. Hey.
Harry.
I can't believe he said that.
To be clear, I think that was Jeffery talking, not Harry.
He looked at me like...I was some kind of monster.
Maybe I am.
I hit him, Bobby.
Yeah, you did.
The way he kept saying Jeffery's name, like they were friends or something.
What did that man do to my son?
I think we just need to give him time to heal.
We can't push him.
I have given that man enough time  and enough of my life.
 Yeah.
It's not about Jeffery anymore. It's about Harry now.
That bastard is dead, and he's still wreaking havoc on my family.
Don't let him live inside your head.
It's hard not to.
Especially when it feels like he's winning.
Probie!
Hen, have you seen the probie?
So this is what it's come to?
He gets a little queasy at a scene, and now it's off with his head?
No. I just want to show him how to disassemble one of these.
 Ah.
 Well, if you see him, let him know I'm looking for him.
 Mm-hmm.
 Probie!
Anybody home?
Okay.
Oh. Hey.
Thought I might find you hiding in here.
Hiding? No. Not at all.
 I finished everything on Buck's checklist.
 Mm-hmm.
So I, you know, started thinking maybe I could earn some extra credit.
So I, uh, came in here and, oh, started tightening the screws on Cap's old desk chair.
Mm.
Okay, fine.
I was hiding from Buck.
I needed a break.
Please don't tell him I'm in here.
Don't worry.
I'll protect you from Buck and his chain saw.
There's a chain saw?
Oh, I think he would call it a teaching tool.
It's just, in the beginning, he seemed so nice.
And now he's like a drill sergeant from hell.
Look.
Buck is going through a lot.
He feels like one of his families has slipped away from him.
So now he's hyper-focused to protect the other one.
The 118.
He's teaching you to make sure that you're ready.
But, because he's Buck, he also wants to make sure that you're worthy.
Do you think I am?
I do.
So don't let him get into your head.
If he pushes too far, push back.

Come on, I'm doing a bit here.
Oh, that's adorable.
Oh, this?
Oh, this is my new everyday piece.
Everyday?
You're kidding me. It's amazing.
It's a impulse buy.
It's just stunning.
You know, darling, it reminds me of the one we've been looking at.
We've been looking at one?
The bangle, silly.
Oh! Oh, yeah, the bangle.
Which bangle?
Uh, the white gold Cartier with the pavé diamonds  all around.
 Oh.
You said you were gonna get it for me for our anniversary.
It's our 51st. Not a huge year.
We do not need a special occasion.
A bangle is a staple.
Oh, yeah, the staple argument.
I love that one.
Guess I'm buying a bangle.
Mm-hmm.
Are you doing a bit again, Felix?
Mm-mm. Lewis, could you, um, check out the basement?
People have been complaining about a foul odor coming from down there.
I didn't even know we had a basement.
Did you, Felix?
I wonder what's down there.
Just a lot of storage. And a chapel.
Oh, a chapel? Really?
I wonder what that's like.
Don't you, Felix?
Oh. Every day.
Uh, so, Beverly, did they say what the foul odor smelled like?
Uh, chemical-like, but foul.
Oh, careful, Felix.
That's a lot of steps.
Lewis, go with him, please.
Ah, hell.
I got this, kid.
Felix, what did you do?
All right, folks, dispatch said the fire started with an explosion inside the chapel, basement level, bravo side of the building.
Chapel?
Someone piss off the big guy?
No word on point of origin.
Buck, Ravi, you guys are in the lead.
Run a fire hose through the front door and start knocking it down.
Probie, wrong hose.
Inch and three quarter.
 I'm Beverly. I'm the manager.
 How many unaccounted for?
We're confirming, but as far as I can tell, two.
Lewis is one of my orderlies and Felix is one of the tenants.
How old is Felix?
I want to say 79.
He was not supposed to be down there, but he insisted.
 Insisted? Why?
 I wish I knew.
We'll get them both out of there. Don't you worry.
All right, let's go.
Cap, we got a live one over here!
Copy that.
You must be Lewis.
Probie, stay with me!
Nozzles on now!
Cap, let's get the door.
All right, on three, Eddie. One, two, three.
I got this!
 Are you sure?
 Yes.
Just get me an assist, go find Felix.
Easy, easy, easy. 118, we need a gurney in the basement level.
<i>On our way, Cap.</i> Easy, Lewis. Best if we let the surgeons at the hospital take that out.
Cap!
Hey, Felix, is that you? Can you hear me?
Let me get this on you, and then we're gonna move this pew and get some morphine in you.
All right.
I think his hip is shattered.
All right, we set?
On three. One, two, three.
You're doing great. You're doing great, Lewis.
You're doing great.
All right.
Oh! No, no!
Now, uh, not-not so great.
It's all right.
We're all all right.
I need you to hold pressure.
That fire is spreading again.
More water, probie!
What the hell?!
Let's go, Eddie.
Can't move him until I tie this off.
He could bleed internally.
Come on, probie! More water!
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
These chemicals are reacting to water.
We need CO2.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Probie, wait up!
Let's go, go, go, go!
Hen, looks like we've got a potential second fire starting here; You need to clear out.
Let's go.
Almost there, Cap.
Where's that CO2?!
Okay, I got it, Cap! That's it!
 Let's go!
 All right.
Panikkar!
Take over for me here, Panikkar!
Got it?
 Yeah, got it.
 All right.
What is it, Cap?
This is somebody's idea of retirement.
There he is!
 He's alive!
 Oh.
Oh, thank God.
Felix, are you all right, sweetheart?
I feel great.
That could be the morphine talking, ma'am.
Dispatch, this site is now a crime scene.
Looks like we just uncovered a meth lab.
How else could I afford a bangle?
And a diamond-encrusted one, no less.
F-F-Felix. It...
It must-must be the morphine talking.
Or-or he's doing a bit. Are you doing a bit?
Nothing but the best for my Fiona.
Actually, only the best for Marcia, because that's who you were always trying to beat.
Hey, fellas.
This is Marcia and Herman Jones, by the way.
We spent our entire adult lives trying to keep up with the actual Joneses.
Show 'em the bracelet, guys.
Anything you'd like to add, ma'am?
It's not all about the bangles and the diamonds.
It's this place!
Do you know how much leisure living actually costs?
I had no choice but to turn to a life of crime.
Well, looks like you should've chosen something a little less explosive.
Ha.
Hey, probie.
What'd I do now?
You saved the day with that CO2 call.
Congratulations.
I think you're ready.
<i>Hey, you've reached the voice mail</i> <i>of Maddie Kendall. Leave a message.</i> Hey, Maddie, it's, uh, it's me.

Buck.
It's dinnertime. Let's go.
I thought we were having Mexican tonight.
Yeah, Cap switched it up.
He didn't want to trigger me so soon after you turned my gurney into a taco.
Still can't figure out how you did it.
I didn't even know it could bend like that.
Yeah, me either.
Well, you managed to fix it.
And apparently you can now disassemble a chain saw in under a minute.
Oh, sorry. Am I in your seat or something?
No. You're good, probie.
 All right, let's eat.
 Hold on, Cap.
There's something I, uh, I wanted to say to all of you.
I've really loved being a part of the 118 these past five years.
This place and, uh, you guys mean so much to me.
Which is why, for the good of everyone, I've decided I-I'm gonna put in for a transfer.
What?
Wait, what? No, I-I know it's a lot of change, with Chimney leaving, but I really think probie...
Ravi is ready to fill the spot.
Chimney's spot?
Uh, no.
No, Eddie is replacing Chimney.
You're replacing me.
Who replaces me?
Uh, I'm sure Cap can figure that one out.
Great.
For a minute there, it seemed like we all forgot who the captain is.
 If I may...
 You're not leaving, Buck.
 And Chimney is coming back, guys. We don't know that.
What I do know is that nothing is the same without him.
E-Everything feels broken now, and it's my fault.
 I'm the reason he's gone.
 I told Chimney to leave.
He came to see me, said he wanted to find her.
I told him he should.
I told him it was the right thing to do.
And I offered to go with him.
Oh.
He's coming back, Buck.
With Maddie.
And when he does, you're gonna be right here, where you belong.
You're stuck with us.
Now, can we please eat?
You guys are so weird.
Uh, actually, sir, your dog is in violation of the leash law.

Sorry I'm late.
Please come in. Have a seat.
Oh, when you called, I was kind of thrown off because I didn't think we had an appointment today.
Well, we didn't.
Dr. Nathanson was good enough to squeeze us in, so...
Michael told me about the other night.
Sounds like a very stressful incident with Harry.
Yes, it was, for everyone.
I don't think we know what to do anymore.
It just feels like nothing we say  gets through to him.
 And I don't think that hitting him will do the trick either.
 Michael.
 It's understandable that emotions are running high, which is why I think we should change course.
Try something else.
Those are the names of some very good therapists.
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you suggesting that we take Harry to see someone else?
Because I-I really don't think a big change is...
For you.
This your doing?
We swore we'd never hit our kids.
You know, that we would wouldn't be those type of parents, you know.
Raise our kids different than the way that we were raised.
Athena, you hit Harry.
Hey.
How was your shift?
Uh, it was okay.
What's the occasion?
You.
Yes, Evan Buckley, all of this is absolutely about you.
Just you.
You, uh...
 You did this for me?
 Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
By the way, um, you were right about Chimney leaving.
No one is mad at me.
See, I told you.
Well, it turns out he, uh, he talked them all before he left, and they got to say goodbye.
I understand why Michael was worried, but sitting in that office felt like I was the criminal.
Michael should've talked to you first.
I don't know what he was thinking springing that on you.
He was thinking that he can't trust me.
That he needed a witness to our conversation.
Jeffery would be pleased to know that his plan is working even better than he ever could have imagined.
Well, now is not the time to give up.
Not on yourself and not on Harry.
Well, he wanted to break me.
He's winning, Bobby.
He doesn't get to win.
Because you're not gonna stop fighting. That is who you are.
And I'm gonna be right there fighting beside you.
He was wrong.
You love this family, and you're not gonna stop fighting for it.
He turned my own son against me.
What do I do if I can't fight that?
If I can't reach him?
You will.
Deep down, Harry knows you still love him.
He'll find his way back.
MICHAEL All right, man, let's wash up. It's time to eat.
Harry...now, man.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Harry! Now!
Hello? <i>Evan?</i> Maddie, hey.
Uh, thank God. Are-are you okay?
<i>Why is Chimney in Utah?</i> Uh, he-he left town looking for you.
Found out what happened to Jee-Yun.
<i>- I told you not...</i>  No, he-he figured it out on his own.
Wait a minute. How do you know where Chimney is?
 You talk to him? <i>- He emailed me a video.</i> <i>Jee-Yun started crawling.</i> Maddie, please just tell me where you are.
Okay? I-I can come and get you or I can send Chimney or whatever you want.
We just...we need to know that you're safe.

Yeah, I think so.
I think I know where she is.

And for God's sake, put on some underwear.
Good morning, Doc.
It's 4:00 p. m.
Well, it's morning to me.
Hello, sir.
I need you to be on high alert today, Vaughn.
Inmates have been acting extra combative lately.
Any idea why?
Could be the new warden's reforms, but I don't know.
Feels like somebody's been agitating.
Copy that. Where do you want me?
The usual. Mitchell needs a walk.
 Not again.
 You're the only one he likes.
Hands.
All right, let's go. You know the drill.
GUARD Let's go! Line it up!
This guy is so freaking weird.
Hey. No littering.
All right, time's up.
Let's pack it in.
This is 911 Metro. Is this a drill?
<i>This is Security Chief Isaacs at Jamestown State Prison.</i> The code is 57-Charlie-Adam-James.
Color of the day is yellow.
code yellow.
Inmates have broken free of containment and have taken control of Cell Blocks A and C.
We have multiple fires burning, <i>and the ventilation system</i> <i>is pushing smoke throughout the prison.</i> Situation is critical. I repeat, this is not a drill.
<i>The unrest started in Cell Block Two</i> <i>and spread quickly.</i> <i>Then a handful of prisoners</i> <i>took out the fire suppression system</i> <i>and started setting fires around the facility.</i> We managed to put out the smaller fires, but the biggest one's still burning in the HVAC corridor.
What are we walking through to get to the fire?
Eyes, buzz us through.
<i>The riot's only 40% contained at the moment,</i> <i>o you'll be escorted by four ofs my men in full protective gear</i> <i>carrying nonlethal weaponry.</i> <i>The main corridor is clear and locked down tight.</i> <i>e'll get you in and out safely.
 W</i> <i>You just have to take care of that fire.</i> All right, guys, get those hoses set.
Come on, let's go. Let's go!
Buck, Eddie, put up a water curtain.
That thing is gonna keep sucking smoke up into the system.
Okay, Ravi, go find the kill switch.
You let me know when you got it.
We got it, Cap.
All right, guys, knock it down, knock it down.
 All right, guys, let's go.
 You got it.
 Okay, Garcia, fire's out. Sorry.
Block Three's blowing up. I got to go deal with that.
 What about our escort?
 Block Two is still locked down.
Wilkinson can handle your walk out.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, 118, let's go.
We're on the move.
What is that? Is someone else in here?
No, this area should be secure.
Over here.
Holy crap, that's Mitchell.
I wonder who got the drop on him.
Maybe one of your colleagues.
It doesn't look like he held back, either.
 Airway's compromised.
We're probably looking at a crushed trachea.
 All right, we got to move.
 Whoa, whoa, hey.
 These men are injured.
 Oh, and the guy in the shackles has got a nasty gash in his lower abdomen.
They're scumbags. Leave 'em here.
<i>GUARD  e've lost control of Block One.
 W</i> <i>All guards, fall back.</i> We're not leaving anybody. All right.
Let's get 'em up and out. No time for gurneys.
Yes, Warden, I get it, but there's no way I can confidently say anything's been put down at this point.
<i>We just lost the mess hall.</i> <i>Inmates are loose in the main corridor.</i> Sir, we're struggling to maintain control.
Eyes, buzz us out.
Whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop! He's having a seizure.
Okay, get him down, get him down.
All right, you guys go. Your guy can barely breathe.
Go. We're gonna be right behind you. That's an order.
 Now, go.
 Protocol says you got to have two guards with you.
Plenty of room if you want to join.
I need an ambulance escort for a prisoner transporting to the local ER.
 Anybody copy? <i>Vaughn here.</i> <i>Me and Mahoney are on the way.</i> I got to get back in there.
Don't try to leave without that escort, all right?
Okay, how we doing, Hen? We got to move.
Seizure's probably due to blood loss.
 Cap, let's get him outside.
 Okay. All right.
Grab him by the arms.
Because reinforcements still need to move between sections.
Damn it.
Loose inmates in Block Two.
Need backup for Block Two!
You guys our escort?
Yes, sir. Let's get moving.
LAFD, you need to move.
Infirmary, it's still secure.
Okay, let's move! Let's go.
Move! Come on.
<i>Vaughn and Mahoney are escorting a prisoner.</i> Let 'em through.
We can't get out. We've got an injured inmate.
Here, put him over on the bed.
 Help me over here!
Sorry, Doc. You okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'll be fine.
What's going on with the patient?
He's got a stab wound to the lower abdomen.
He's lost a lot of blood.
He was convulsing, but it's slowed.
It's probably from the BP. He'll need fluids.
Wait. That's not an inmate.
That's Freddie Vaughn.
He's a guard.
 What?
 Where'd you find him?
In the machine room, next to the other prisoner.
 But if this one's a guard...
 The other one probably is, too.
So where are the prisoners?
<i>118 ambulance, come in.</i> <i>Buck, Eddie, come in.</i>  Mm-mm. <i>-Buck, Eddie,</i> <i>if you can hear me, return to the prison.</i> <i>Come...</i> Kill the lights and sirens.
What the hell?
I can't thank you boys enough.
I've waited 18 years to get the hell out of that place.
Check 'em.
Okay, so you broke out.
What now?
Patient in there currently fighting for every breath.
That your handiwork?
Hey. No littering.
<i>GUARD Rapid Team, fire and rescue's six minutes out.</i> <i>You got to clear a path.</i> <i>Push those guys back.</i>  So, what do we do?
 Don't know yet.
 Maybe they just want the ambulance?
 Why would they search us if they're gonna leave us behind?
There's two of us.
There's two of them.
 There's two...
 Cute kid.
Yours?
I'm guessing he lives with you at 4995 South Bedford Street.
Hey, man. Hey, don't even...
Okay, so now that we're all on the same page, here's what's gonna happen next.
Warden isn't sure if the riot was cover for the escape or if the escapees just seized on the opportunity.
So Buck and Eddie are in an ambulance with two convicts and an injured guard.
Well, dispatch has tracked the transponder on the ambulance.
It's been stationary for a couple minutes.
I've got units heading there right now.
What about Bobby and the rest of the 118?
They're still inside the prison.
Looks like the blade must've hit his splenic artery.
We can clamp it, slow his blood loss.
We should give him something for the pain first.
Top drawer. One vial of morphine.
 Stop. Don't sedate him.
 I need you to wake him up.
 What?
Look, you said he's in security, right?
I need somebody who can tell me about security protocols here.
Who has keys, what they open and if we're safe in here.
I've been a doctor here for a decade.
I can tell you there are mine, the warden's and the shift commander's.
We're perfectly safe.
The shift commander in the Lexan booth who let us in here?
Yes, the security pod. Why?
 Listen.
You hear that?
What is that?
If I had to guess, I'd say that's a bunch of guys trying to break into the security pod.
I need reinforcements to the security pod!
 There's no way they...
 Doc, I have been a firefighter for nearly three decades, and trust me when I say there is not a locked room anywhere that the right tools and enough time can't break open.
Now, please, wake him up.
Should be about half a mile ahead -- on the right.
Dispatch, I'm not seeing anything resembling an ambulance on this road.
It has to be there.
You just passed it.
What?
I don't know what you're seeing on your end.
Their transponder is pinging to your location.
You should be on top of them right now.
Yeah, about that.
Is he all right?
Other than choking on his own blood?
Buck, hand me the Yankauer suction tube.
Hey, just make sure he doesn't die in here.
Suddenly, you care about the guy you almost beat to death?
Hey, if I wanted this guy dead, he'd be dead.
I kept him alive.
Now, you do the same.
Warden sent me their inmate files.
We can't track 'em, but maybe we can figure out where they might've gone.
Dominic Gale.
He's not from here.
He got picked up six years ago on an out-of-state warrant for a home invasion in Milwaukee.
Six years ago? What's he still doing in a California prison?
Uh, he killed a fellow prisoner while awaiting extradition, so we decided to hang on to him until after he finishes his 20.
No local ties. What about the other one?
Mitchell Trent -- he's been on death row for 18 years.
Uh, triple homicide.
Hmm. And a long-ass list of prior offenses.
Yeah, dating back to a sealed juvenile record.
No visitors, no pen pals.
Until last year.
According to this, he started writing letters to his ex.
 An ex from 18 years ago?
 Mm-hmm.
Savanna Richards. She testified at his trial.
She was the state's key witness against him.
 She still local?
 She is.
We need to get her into protection right now.
Do you really think that he'd go through all this trouble breaking out just to settle an old score?
18 years is a long time to stew.
Maybe that pot finally boiled over.
You, go around back.
If they are inside, I don't want them making another escape.
 You, with me.
 Yes, ma'am.
LAPD. Anybody home?
Police department.
 You looking for Savanna?
 Yeah. We knocked.
She doesn't seem to be home.
She's barely here.
Usually doesn't get home till late.
Do you know how I might find her? It's important.
Uh, I have her contact.
Let me grab my phone.
Okay.
Let's get an unmarked unit here.
All right? They can sit on the house until our jailbirds are back in their cage.
Also, I want a patrol doing laps around this neighborhood  looking for that ambulance.
 Yes, Sergeant.
Here you go.
 Much appreciated, ma'am. Thank you.
 Mm-hmm.
Savanna Richards?
This is Sergeant Athena Grant with the LAPD.
Can you tell me where you are right now?
Okay, okay. Vaughn.
Vaughn, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Vaughn? Okay, good. Okay.
I'm sorry about this, and I don't know how much you remember, but I am with the Los Angeles Fire Department.
There was a riot here. We tried to put out a fire, and we got stuck in here on our way out. Do you understand me?
Yeah? Okay, good. Listen.
The guards lost control of this cell block, and I don't know how much time we have in here until the rioters start coming for us.
And I need to get you and my people out of this infirmary.
Cap, he needs pain management.
You need to stop this.
Vaughn, is there any way out of here  besides through that door?
Can we go through any air ducts or tunnels or crawl spaces?
P-P-P...
The pod?
The security pod is under siege.
G-Gas.
Gas.
 Tear gas? I suppose we could try to contact the guards, if there are any real guards left, and have them run up to the HVAC, but we turned it off 'cause of the smoke.
Are we even sure tear gas would work?
Kind of feels like it would just make everyone mad.
Nitrous oxide.
Laughing gas?
That'll make them less mad.
All right, Doc, draw me a map, and I will turn the HVAC on, and I'll go into the dental office, and I'll run what's ever in there through the vents, and we hope that works.
That sounds like a lot of distance to cover, Cap.
I should go with you.
I-I can turn on the HVAC, and you can  get the gas.
 No, you're needed here.
Doc only has one hand, and Vaughn could go south again.
I'll go.
I can do it.
You'll be a target.
Heroic firefighters might make especially good ones.
What if he doesn't look like a firefighter?
Doesn't look like anything is broken, but you probably won't have normal range of motion for at least a few weeks.
But tell me, Firefighter Wilson, will I play piano again?
Did you before?
I didn't think the joke was that bad.
 Sorry.
You made me think of a friend of mine.
It's the kind of joke he'd make.
He's a paramedic, too.
Well, if he's anywhere near as sharp as you, I have sorely underestimated the skills of the Los Angeles Fire Department.
Maybe I should've gone into your line of work.
Well, thank you.
I was actually, uh, looking at heading into your line of work.
Oh. Medical school?
What year?
 Second.
Tough year.
He's bottoming out. He's about to code.
The blood buildup from the clamp must have burst the artery.
 What's the next step?
 Well, if we were in an operating room -- which we're not -- a surgeon would need to do an end-to-end anastomosis.
Suture the artery to return normal blood flow to his spleen.
Well, can you...
Not like this. It's too involved.
You know the procedure.
Yeah, I-I've observed two.
 But I can't...
 Yes, you can.
I-I'm not a doctor. Not yet.
He doesn't need you to be a doctor.
He needs you to be my hands.
He needs you to help me save his life.
 What are you doing now?
 Intubating him.
Buck, hand me the bougie. Long blue tube in the cabinet.
Almost there, Mitch.
Wait, you guys are serious?
 We're really going to a hospital?
 Thought that's what you wanted.
You're so concerned about the health of your friend here.
Now you can walk him through the front doors.
Doesn't look like we have any company.
All right, pretty boy stays with me.
Dom, you and the kid take our friend inside.
Hand him off, then you know what to do.
Hey, man, listen, I don't know what you want, but there is a hospital full of sick people...
Just go, or I'll shoot you.
Or better yet, I shoot him.
And then I find his kid and I shoot him, too.
Buck.
Nice and steady.
Just like you've done it a thousand times before.
Okay.
Where do we go?
Right this way.
Where the hell is everyone?
Hey, hey! Aah! Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, hey, I-I'm a firefighter!
 Hands behind your back.
 Evan Buckley with the 118.
 Aah! Hey. Hey.
 Hey, come on!
 Ah-ah-ah!
 Buck? Buck.
Uh, hey. This one's good.
 Let him up. Let him go.
 You sure? Okay.
 On your feet.
 Sorry about that.
All right, let's go. You have the right to remain silent.
 I suggest you use that right.
 Call it in?
 You good?
Yeah. How'd you know we were coming here?
We figured out why Mitchell broke out.
Where is he? Where's Mitchell?
Still in the ambulance.
With Eddie.
Mitchell Trent, this is LAPD.
We have the area surrounded. Put your weapons down  and come out with your hands up.
 I got a hostage!
Don't come any closer!
How did they find us so fast?
Guess this wasn't part of your 27-step breakout plan.
Shut up.
 I need a minute to think.
 Might want to think on the fact that there's only one way out of this ambulance.
Look, just give up.
You can live to escape another day.
I ain't going nowhere.
Unless it's inside that hospital.
Tac team is working on a plan to take the ambulance.
Look, as soon as they make their move, he is gonna shoot Eddie.
There's got to be a way to talk him down, get him to surrender.
It's a little more complicated than that, Buck.
Surrender is not what Mitchell's after.
He came to see his son.
My son...
he's here, in the ICU.
Congenital heart failure.
Kid's been waiting almost a year for a new heart.
So you're here to force his way up the list at gunpoint.
No.
I'm here to give him mine.
I'm thirsty.
Don't drink it all, man.
This is a toast.
I told you they killed Mitchell.
Man, leave some.
Hey!
You!
Do I know you?
Let me see you.
Hey, hey!
Hey, get back here. I'm talking to you.
I hope that's enough.
Okay.
Forceps are set on either side of the ruptured area.
The patient has been sedated.
And the atraumatic needle is prepped.
Remember, simple continuous sutures, just like they taught you in home ec class.
I took shop.
Good, good.
Perfect.
Done.
Excellent, Dr. Wilson.
I told you I'm not a doctor.
Yet.
That'll be our little secret.
<i>BOBBY Hen, it's a go.</i> Copy that, Cap.
What's going on? Was there another fire?
Think you're gonna need this.
 You guys okay? You tell me.
Did it work?
Okay, guys, let's go. We got to move.
 I guess it did. Let's go.
<i>WOMAN On-call chaplain to ICU One.</i> <i>On-call chaplain to ICU One.</i> This is Savanna Richards.
Mitchell's ex, Nolan's mom.
So Nolan is why he broke out?
Mitchell started writing me letters last year, saying that he wanted to save his son.
I still don't know how he found out about Nolan.
Wait, you mean you didn't tell him?
The last time that I saw Mitchell was in a courtroom 18 years ago.
He tried to jump the defense table to get me, screaming he was gonna kill me for betraying him.
I told him to rot in hell.
I didn't think there was much to say after that.
Mitchell's been waging a campaign to save Nolan.
He's contacted the State Board of Prisoners, the governor, asking to be executed.
I thought we didn't do that anymore.
Legally, it's complicated.
But he wants the state to kill him so he can donate his heart.
All of his requests were denied.
So he decided to force the issue.
Mitchell still hasn't responded.
Does he need to respond?
We know what his demands are, right?
He wants to donate his heart to his kid.
Buck, that's not on the table.
It's not even on the menu.
State of California doesn't allow death row inmates to donate their organs.
Come on, that's just a technicality.
It's a law, Buck.
Prisoners have made petitions to donate their kidneys, pieces of their liver to family, and every request to become an organ donor has been denied.
Well, there-there's got to be something else we can do.
Look, we're still trying to talk to him, give him a chance to surrender peacefully.
And if he doesn't?
Then we take the ambulance.
Stop moving around.
Police see the ambulance moving, they're gonna think something's wrong, and they'll breach.
So? I'm the one they're gonna shoot.
Space this small, not a lot of room for error.
Rather not get caught in crossfire.
Hey, why can't you understand?
I'm trying to do one good thing here.
You got bored in a cage, and you wanted a way out.
No, I'm doing this for Nolan.
I'm trying to save his life.
He tell you this is what he wants?
To get your heart and live the rest of his life knowing how much blood you shed so he could have it?
You think that's a feel-good ending for him?
What do you want me to do? Go back to prison?
Sit there rotting in my cell while my kid dies?
I want you to shut up.
And let me help you.
Bobby.
 Everyone okay? <i>Everybody here is fine.-</i> Just dropped off the injured guard at the hospital.
<i>How are Buck and Eddie doing?</i> Buck's fine. I'm standing right here with him.
What about Eddie?
So, what was the plan after you got into the hospital?
Dom was supposed to go in there, confirm that Nolan was there.
Then he was gonna force the doctors to do the transplant.
I die, Nolan lives.
Do you really think anyone was gonna let that happen?
No, probably not, but it was the only thing I could come up with.
Turn yourself in.
Let them take you into custody alive, and we find another way to save your son.
Like what?
Buck, the other guy, his girlfriend's a reporter.
We have her do a story on your son, get the public behind Nolan, pressure the governor into letting you donate.
I don't want that for him.
People knowing I'm his father.
When they sentenced me to death, the judge said I was "the worst of the worst." And he was right.
I was like my dad, who was like his dad.
All of us in and out of prison our whole lives like it was the family business, uh...
When I...when I found out about Nolan, I was like, "Great.
I'll meet him when he shows up in the cell next to me." He's not like that, though.
He's a good kid.
Nothing like me at all.
So you think saving him, what, redeems you?
No.
But...me dying and him living maybe makes the world a better place.
Okay.
Go on, open up the door. Let 'em know we're coming out.
You mean it?
Did you mean it?
What you said about helping Nolan?
I'll fight for him as hard as I'd fight for my own.
Good.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, we're coming out.
Mitchell's ready to surrender.
Hands up!
Okay, Mitchell.
Put down your gun.
Come on out.
They're coming out.
He's out. He's out.
 Show us your hands!
 Hands up.
Hold. Everybody hold.
Hold your positions.
One more promise from you.
What now?
When he asks about the donor, he can never know it was me.
Drop the gun!
Eddie.
 Move!
 Let's go!
Move in! Move in!
Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie.
Get out! Get out!
Go grab a crash cart and help me keep his heart pumping.
What are you doing? What happened?
He shot himself. Bullet hit his brain.
Go tell the hospital they need a crash team out here.
They need to prep an OR.
Eddie, he's dead.
But his heart isn't, and I need it to stay that way.
Go!
Okay! Prep the OR! Come on!
I know you got other things on your mind right now, but...
I'm-I'm so sorry that he put you through that.
But that's Mitchell.
Couldn't do the right thing to save his life.
I don't know what I'm gonna tell Nolan.
About his father?
About me.
How do I explain ever being with a man like Mitchell?
You loved him, even if he wasn't worth loving.
But that's on Mitchell.
Whatever bad choices he made, they're his.
You don't end up with a man like Mitchell without having made a few bad choices of your own.
You helped put him away.
That was brave.
I did it for Nolan.
I never wanted him to be touched by any of this.
Neither did Mitchell.
He was watching you for years, from a distance.
He saw that Nolan was a good kid.
Mitchell didn't want to screw him up, too.
He said that?
Right before he...
The last thing he said...
"He can never know it was me." <i>That boy is going to die without that heart.</i> And the father -- or whatever you want to call him -- has made himself a donor.
Let's just let 'em do the surgery, figure the rest out later.
This is way above our pay grade.
We don't make the laws, just enforce them.
Well, what exactly does the law say?
"Death row inmates," right?
I know what you're thinking, but there is no way, Athena.
The governor is never going to pardon him for a triple homicide, not even posthumously.
What would he say to a commutation?

Both are in stable condition.
Dr. Cochran sends his regards.
Good news across the board.
But I don't think I can wait around for any more.
Text me when the kid gets out of surgery.
 Yeah.
 You headed home?
No. I have class in an hour.
After the day and night you had, you're still going to class?
Yeah. Well...
if I want to be a badass general surgeon, I can't afford to waste another minute.
General surgery?
Didn't know you'd decided on a specialty.
I think I just figured it out.
How about that?
Oh.
It's done.
He made it through okay?
Yeah. They're, um...they're wheeling him into recovery now.
Um...
I-I really can't thank you all enough.
Not just for what you did but, um, for being here...with me.
Go be with your son.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go see mine.
I'm headed out, too.
I'll, uh, see you in 48 hours.
 Miss you already.
All right, I'm going to head to the station and clock out.
I'll see you at home?
 I might be here a little longer.
 Oh?
<i>MAN Dr. Hall to Transplant ICU.</i> <i>Dr. Hall to Transplant ICU.</i> All right, understand I love you, but I will not be waiting up for you.
I love you, too.
 All right.
 All right.
Everything okay?
Yeah, sure.
It's funny, after a shift like the one we just had, with all that danger and commotion, sometimes the hardest part is going home by yourself, being alone in all that quiet.
I guess so.
So, what do you say we go someplace where it's not so quiet?
Should be just in time for the morning rush at the coffee shop.
I don't want to talk about yesterday, though.
That's okay.
We can just have breakfast and not talk about it together.
What do you say?
 Okay.
 All right.
Um, tell him to call me later, and maybe I'll answer.
Hey. You're up.
Okay.
 And you're safe.
 Yeah.
I was so worried.
I'm, uh...I'm okay.
Just glad it's over.
The news wasn't clear about what started the whole thing.
There were riots?
Yeah, orchestrated by this guy who wanted to break out and see his kid.
Are you serious?
 Yeah.
 So, did it work?
Did he get to see his kid?
No.
No, he, uh...he shot himself before he made it inside.
Dad?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Just, um...
I'm really glad you're my kid.
 You're weird, Dad.
@@@@@@
How is it that every time the world seems to end, it ends some more?
"9-1-1" all new, Mondays.
This thing is holding on by a thread, Cap!
And watch other Fox shows, like "Our Kind of People," "The Big Leap," and "The Resident" on Fox.
<i>- I think I'm dying.
 Can you tell me your address?</i> <i>I'm not anywhere. Aah, I'm bleeding. Yeah.</i> <i>- I think I was shot.
 Okay.</i>  Can you tell me your name? <i>  Edgar.</i> Okay, Edgar. You said you didn't know where you were?
<i>Woods. Last thing I remember.</i> Are there any landmarks around you?
Something to help narrow down your location?
<i>It's too dark. I think I'm underground.</i> I think I'm buried alive.
<i>118, this is Fire 1.</i> <i>We're looking for a needle in a haystack out here.</i> All right, victim's name is Edgar Hill.
He told dispatch that he was carjacked, got shot and buried in some sort of coffin out here.
Based on the size of an average male, that box is probably 86 by 30 inches.
That's 45 feet of cubic space, most of which is taken up by Edgar.
So he's got ten minutes to an hour's worth of air left.
We don't know how long he's been underground, right?
Or which piece of ground he's under.
Cell towers can only limit the search by so much.
Let's fan out.
Hey, Cap, do we know how serious that gunshot wound is?
Blood loss may have gotten him already.
Dispatch still has him on the line.
Hopefully, they can keep him talking.
And not hyperventilating.
There's not enough air in here.
You got to get me out of here.
<i>Edgar, stay calm.</i>  Do not tell me to stay calm. <i>  Edgar, stop.</i> I know you're scared, but staying calm will help you stay alive.
The faster you breathe, the more oxygen you consume.
And we want you to save as much oxygen as you can <i>until they find you. You understand?</i> Yeah. Okay, yeah.
A mystery is unfolding in the deep, dark woods at this hour, where it appears a man was shot and buried alive earlier tonight.
<i>A massive search and rescue effort is currently underway.</i> <i>118, be advised.</i> <i>Infrared penetration is not optimal at this time.</i> Copy that, Fire 1. Keep doing what you can.
Buck, you get anything on sound detection?
Nothing, Cap.
If he's really out here, shouldn't he be able to hear us?
<i>Edgar, rescuers are on the scene.</i> <i>Are you sure you can't hear them?</i> Can barely hear anything.
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh, this damn gunshot!
<i>I'm gonna die in a box. Stupid...</i> Oh.
<i>wooden...</i> box.
Cap, I got something.
 What? <i>  Thought I heard a voice.</i> Edgar, what was that?
<i>I got to</i> get...out!
Yes.
Edgar, what are you doing?
Gonna break...Oh!
<i>this...</i> down!
Edgar!
 Tell me what's happening. <i>  No.</i> Oh, no.
<i>It's caving in!</i> 118, I think our victim's running out of time.
You got anything on your side?
<i>We thought we might have picked</i> something up with the sound equipment, <i>but then we lost it.</i> We're still scanning that same area.
<i>It's gone quiet.</i> What if I gave you a sustained sound to listen for?
<i>If Buck is right about</i> what he heard, we should be able to pinpoint his location.
<i>Yeah, I don't know if it'll be loud,</i>  but it won't be very long. <i>  Copy that.</i> This is Captain 118. Be advised.
<i>We are conducting a targeted sound sweep.</i> Fire 1, give us five minutes  of breathing room. <i>  Copy that, Captain.</i> Everybody else, hold the work.
Radio silent until my call.
<i>Edgar, here's what I need you to do.</i> Take a deep breath <i>- and scream.
 What?!</i> Scream, Edgar! Now!
There.
There!
Here!
<i>Everybody, dig! Move!</i> Hey, come on! Come on!
Edgar, stay with us!
We're coming for you!
 That's the box.
 All right, let's get the top off.
Hey, hey.
Careful, now. Careful, guys.
Get the gurney over here.
We got him, Cap! We got him.
Dispatch, we've located and extracted the victim.
Beginning medical assessment.
Copy that, 118. He's all yours.
 We've got a pulse.
 Roll him on his side.
 I'll clear his airway.
 Found the bullet wound.
Pulse 120 and thready.
BP 90/50. Breath sounds severely diminished bilaterally.
He's aspirated. We've probably got hypovolemic shock. While we're waiting, let's start a line.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Lizzie.
Thought your name was Julie.
<i>We've had no official word from rescue personnel,</i> but based on radio communication, the search has been going on for well...
 Oh, coming through.
 over...
Uh, it appears the man has been found.
There you see him.
First responders literally pulling him from the ground moments ago.
We do not yet have the identity nor the condition of the victim, but he does appear to be alive.
Investigators are now beginning to arrive on the scene as the next phase of this mystery begins.
Where's Bobby?
<i>Detective, it's good to have you back.</i> It's good to be back. So what do we got?
Victim is on the way to the hospital.
Looks like he got shot in the back, put in a coffin and buried up here.
Coffin? I thought the victim said it was a carjacking.
That's what he told dispatch.
So carjackers that dig holes and bring coffins. That's new.
Victim say anything when you pulled him out?
He was calling out to somebody named Lizzie, saying he was sorry.
Could've been his wife or girlfriend?
 Your guys did that?
 No, victim did.
Tried to punch and claw his way out.
Buried alive.
Well, that's the stuff of nightmares.
Harry?
Didn't you hear me calling you?
No. I thought I saw...
What?
Come on. I got to drop you off.
I don't want to be late for work.
You know, you jumped like you saw a ghost.
It's normal to be curious about him.
The man who kidnapped you.
I can't believe my dad showed you that.
You're not in trouble, Harry.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Your father's just concerned.
He's a snitch.
Well, he's a snitch who loves you.
Can you tell me what made you want to look that up?
No. I don't want to talk about it.
Not with you, and not with them. They weren't kidnapped.
None of you have any idea what that was like.
But we want to...understand what happened to you.
How is that gonna help me?
One of the ways we move past our trauma is to confront it and share it.
You're just like them.
Everybody wants me to move on, like nothing happen.
That's not what I meant.
The last thing I want is for you to pretend it didn't happen.
Because it did.
I see him sometimes.
See him where? In your dreams?
No.
I only see him when I'm awake.
<i>She called it a breakthrough.</i> <i>Isn't it? Harry's starting to open up.</i> Well, to her. Not to me or Michael.
 He still doesn't trust us.
 Well, look, I know that it hurts, feels like Harry's shutting you out, but try to be patient. It's just gonna take a little time.
What if we're running out of time?
He barely said a word on the way back to Michael's.
And now he's visiting that damned Jeffery Hudson website.
Harry's looking for answers.
Something terrible happened to him.
He can't confront Jeffery, so he's trying to understand him.
Yeah. That's what my therapist said.
But it should be noted that neither of you are on that website with crosshairs over your face.
 And the things that they wrote about me.
 Aren't true.
You didn't drive that man to do anything.
Hudson made his choices, didn't care who he hurt, and that is on him, not on you.
Oh, Harry still blames me.
I mean, it just feels like the harder I try to hold on to him, the more he slips away.
<i>It's quite a story, Mr. Hill.</i> I know, right?
Yeah. Well, the tale is a little thin, though.
You say that a man took you hostage at gunpoint and made you drive to the woods.
But you don't remember anything that happened after he shot you.
They say trauma can screw with your memory.
You also don't remember where you were when he got in the car.
It all happened so fast. I...
I-I think I was driving home.
Okay, from where?
I don't remember.
And if I was to ask you if you got a good look at your abductor?
Never saw his face.
Right.
He had one of those things on, a...
What do you call it? A, uh...a baklava.
 Balaclava?
 Yeah.
Exactly.
My mind's just not all there.
Maybe we should start from the beginning, see if we can help jog your memory.
Mr. Hill. I hope you don't mind, but I'm...
Now's not a good time, Ms. Kelly.
Taylor Kelly. Channel 8 news.
Well, I'm a big fan.
 Yeah.
 She can stay.
Well, that's great.
Maybe you'd like to give an on-camera statement about your ordeal.
I'm sure the public will want to hear your account of this atrocious crime.
I don't remember much.
Is your wife here? Maybe she can talk about her relief after your miraculous rescue.
 Lizzie?
 Mm-hmm.
Yeah, she's not here.
 Is she home?
 She's on a trip. A cruise.
 In Alaska.
 Mm.
 Girls' cruise trip thing.
 Oh.
You know, communication out there can be pretty spotty.
We can call the ship. I'm sure they could track her down.
Well, reservation wasn't under her name.
She'd still be on the manifest. All passengers are.
You know, uh...
I don't feel so good. Um, maybe if we could finish this later...
 If you could leave a card...
 Of course.
You might want to call me first, Mr. Hill.
If you're in trouble, I can help you.
That was weird, right?
His little song and dance about the wife?
No comment.
His story doesn't make any sense.
What kind of carjacker puts someone in a coffin?
 Your firefighter boyfriend tell you about that?
 No.
I watched your crime scene techs pull it out of a hole and put it in the back of their van.
Come on. I can help you, Detective.
You must have a theory.
Off the record?
All right, here's what I can tell you. Off the record.
I'm putting an officer on Mr. Hill's door.
No one is going in or out other than hospital staff.
Wow. You think the alleged carjacker could come back?
No. But I'm pretty sure you'll try.
♪ <i>Been so long...</i>♪ <i> Boston?</i> Yeah. Buck is convinced he heard the bells of the Old North Church in the background when she called.
The one-if-by-land-two-if-by-sea church?
 That's the one. <i>  And the fact that there's</i> an exact replica of that church in Burbank <i>- never occurred to him?
 You're kidding.</i>  Where are you? <i>  Des Moines.</i> <i>I swear to God, Hen. If I drive to the Eastern Seaboard</i> with my infant daughter, and Maddie's somewhere in the 818, I'm gonna kill Buck.
Yeah, you've already sworn to do that.
<i>Well, then, I'll bring him right to the point of death,</i> and with my not-insubstantial paramedic skills, I will revive him, and then I will kill him.
<i>Why would Maddie be in Boston?</i> <i>Well, that's where she lived with Doug</i> <i>after they got married.</i> Again, I ask, why Boston?
There can't be a lot of happy memories there for her.
<i>He was in medical school.</i> She was in nursing school. They barely saw each other.
<i>She used to tell me it was actually</i> <i>the happiest point in their marriage.</i> What is everyone's obsession with revisiting the past?
<i>Why? Who else is taking you down memory lane?</i> Eva.
She called this morning.
Wants to come by the station and talk.
<i>I don't know what would be worse.</i> <i>Me talking to my ex,</i> or me telling my wife I talked to my ex.
I kind of wish I was in Boston right now.
<i>Do you have any idea</i> <i>where you're gonna look once you get there?</i>  Not yet. <i>  I mean,</i> <i>there's got to be a reason Maddie's gone back to her past.</i> Maybe she's chasing ghosts.
Or maybe I am.
<i>I get goosebumps just thinking about it.</i> Buried alive.
You did a great job.
He sounded so scared, trapped, thinking he was gonna die.
You think that's how Harry felt?
Your brother wasn't buried in the woods.
No, he was walled up under some stairs. Totally different.
May, I'd really rather not relive it, if that's okay with you.
You know, we're-we're trying to put it behind us, you know, so maybe stop bringing it up?
I just don't understand why we can't talk about it.
We <i>are</i> talking about it.
Y-Your brother has his therapist.
Your mom has hers. Hell, I'm even considering talking to one.
Right, but we're not talking to each other.
Dad, we all went through it, in our own ways, but we aren't processing it together.
We're barely processing it at all.
We are all doing the best that we can.
Are we? He hasn't been back to the house.
And I can't help but notice, neither have you.
You know, that's not gonna solve the problem.
No, but it could be a step in the right direction.
You look good.
Thank you.
 What do you want, Eva?
 I'm leaving, Hen.
California.
You know, I've done my time, gotten clean.
It will be two years next month.
And I figure it's time for a-a fresh start.
Well, congratulations.
Safe travels.
So, two years without getting high...
It's a long time to sit with your mistakes, the things you've done and the people you've hurt.
And I know I hurt you.
In ways that I don't even have the words for.
I'm one of your steps.
I owe you so much. You saved my life.
You took in my kid.
And despite everything I did to you,  you never once took it out on him.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How do you know that? Did you talk to Denny?
No. I know you.
Look.
Look, look. I'm-I'm...
I'm glad that you're doing better, and-and-and I hope it continues.
But...forgiving you?
That's gonna take a minute.
I know.
I just appreciate you taking the time to hear me out.
If Denny ever asks about me...
Eva.
Just tell him the truth.
♪ <i>What happened to make you...</i> ♪ Hey! How was your shift?
Weird.
Weird how?
A bus-through-a-building weird, or a-woman's-face-fell-off weird?
An Eva-walked-into-work weird.
She wanted to tell me that she was leaving town, and she was sorry for everything she had done, and she hoped that I could forgive her.
And...did you?
What? No.
I mean, I heard her out, but that's it. She-she left. I...
I didn't get the sense that there was anything more to it.
She seemed sincere.
She always does to you.
That's not fair.
Fair?
You cheated on me with her.
Or did you forget?
I didn't have to tell you this, you know.
Then why did you?
Because I don't want any more secrets.
I wanted to tell you the truth so that you would know that you can trust me, even when it comes to her.
You really think she's leaving town?
Yeah.
She-she seemed...sincere.
And that is why I can't trust you.
No! No!
Oh, God!
 Ma'am, what's going on?
 He's not breathing.
I went to get him out of the car seat, and he's...
Okay, let me see him. Yeah. I'm a paramedic. Give him to me.
 Okay.
 Okay. You, call 911! All right.
Here, let me see him.
Okay. Did, uh, anything happen while you were driving?
A fender bender? Did you slam on the brakes?
No, nothing like that. Uh, we went to the aquarium. He seemed fine.
 I...
 No pulse. Blood is fresh.
All right. Come on.
Come on, kid. You just gotta breathe.
Come on.
Let's go. Breathe for me.
All right!
 Boston EMS. Step aside.
 Okay, uh, we got a newborn, bleeding from the nose, pulse is steady.
Breathing has returned, looking at a possible vitamin K deficiency.
Sounds like someone trained you well.
Eli.
What the hell are you doing in Boston, Howie?
Chasing ghosts. Long story.
<i>Hey.</i>  Heard you were back.
 I missed you, too.
 Also heard you caught yourself a real head-scratcher.
 Mm.
 Buried-alive guy.
 Yeah. Bobby tell you about that?
No. Taylor Kelly.
Heard you two really got into it at the hospital.
You posted a uni to keep her out?
I couldn't help myself. The woman's a menace.
I'm just trying to figure out how Edgar Hill ended up buried alive, and why he won't tell anyone what happened.
Uh, isn't that the police's job?
I don't think they have any idea what they're looking for.
Mm. Edgar Hill.
Carjacked, shot and buried alive.
Claims to have no memory of what happened and no idea of who might want to hurt him.
 Married?
 Yeah.
Lizzie. Married ten years.
Current whereabouts unknown.
He said she was on a cruise to Alaska.
Let me guess. He lied?
"I'm sorry, Lizzie." That's what he said when you pulled him out of the hole, right?
How do you know that? I didn't tell you that.
What? You think you're my only source?
Were you able to track down the coffin?
Was able to trace it to the store, but that was it.
They couldn't tell me who bought those specific boards.
Just gave me a list of everyone who made a purchase.
It's gonna take some time to run down all these.
Did learn something interesting, though.
The manager at the store said that they all knew Edgar Hill.
Apparently, he shopped there.
Well, he is a contractor, so that's not surprising.
He'd been in a lot the last couple of weeks, but, oddly, manager couldn't find any purchase records.
So he's coming into the store, but not buying anything?
You think he's visiting a friend?
<i>The wife didn't have any friends.</i> At least according to the neighbors.
But then, past few weeks, they started noticing a van parked down the street.
And one of them saw Lizzie getting out of it.
Could've been anyone's van. Could've been the pool guy.
Okay, never had a pool, but I'm pretty sure you don't meet with them inside their van.
You think she was having an affair.
I think there was definitely something wrong with that marriage.
<i>He was having financial troubles.</i> And still managed to find a way to pay for three life insurance policies on the wife.
They don't have kids.
She didn't work outside the home.
And he let the policy on himself lapse.
Lizzie was furious when she found out.
The mail carrier said they had a screaming match in the driveway.
Over life insurance?
He told her she'd never get another penny out of him, dead or alive.
She told him, money or not, she'd rather see him dead.
Still, one thing just doesn't make sense.
The Hills had two cars.
A seven-year-old sedan and a brand-new Range Rover.
Fancy car like that would make Edgar a target.
Except he claims that he was driving the sedan when he got carjacked.
But he had the keys to the SUV.
Did you check the garage at their house?
Empty. Both cars are gone.
I tried to ask Edgar about it, but he stopped talking.
Suppose the wife could have it.
Or maybe he gave it to a friend.
Someone who works at a home improvement store?
<i>Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out.</i> The marriage is in trouble.
Lizzie wants out until she discovers the money is gone.
Edgar's business is failing.
He's about to lose everything he has.
She's invested years into that marriage.
She is not about to walk away with nothing, or worse, half of nothing.
But Edgar still has those life insurance policies, and they're worth millions.
Just not as long as Lizzie's alive.
The house, the cars, the retirement accounts...
They're worth millions.
But only if Edgar is dead.
You think it was a professional hit?
<i>The car could be a down payment</i> until the job is done.
Only one person knows for sure.
We need to find the hit man.
And then we can prove what really happened.
 The wife did it.
 The husband did it.
<i>You're packing.</i> You're actually moving.
Yeah, want to see the lease for my new place in Portland?
I want to know why you keep popping up, trying to blow my life apart.
I'm not trying to blow your life apart.
What are you doing?
You're clean. You got a new life.
You're moving on. Great. Happy for you.
You didn't need to go see Hen. You could've just left town.
You wouldn't understand.
Then make me.
Hen was the first person who ever really saw me.
She said she loved me.
She told me that I mattered.
There was a time when me being clean would've made her proud.
You wanted to make her proud of you again.
Yeah, a little.
But, look, you really don't have to worry about me.
I have been worried about you since the third date.
She told me about you, and her hurt was so raw and so deep.
I didn't know whether to pull her close or run away.
Well, it seems like you made the right choice.
I remember when you called Hen to tell her that you were pregnant.
That you needed her help.
I thought, "That's it.
She's going back to Eva. They're gonna be a family." Every time you call, that's what I feel.
That I am about to lose my wife and my son.
Because all the people I love the most belonged to you first.
Hen is never gonna leave you.
What, because you're moving to Oregon?
'Cause Hen loves you more than me.
Name's Tom Gladden. He works at the store. He met Edgar Hill <i>in the parking lot at least half a dozen times.</i> Ah, ex-Marine.
Looks like he ran into some trouble a few years back.
<i>Did a stint at Lompoc.</i> Hasn't been back to work since Edgar's carjacking.
But he did use his credit card at a motel just up the coast.
Hey, listen.
<i>Can you take his photo over to the hospital?</i> <i>- See if Edgar will identify him?
 No can do.</i> Talked to a uni. Edgar Hill checked out of the hospital earlier this morning.
<i>I got a car sitting on the house in case he comes home.</i> Okay, let me know if he shows up. I'm on my way to the motel.
<i>All right. Go get him, tiger.</i> Detective Ransone.
You know you're a reporter, right?
Your job is to report the news, not create it.
I was gonna call you. I just wanted to make sure the subject was on the premises before you made a trip out.
Maybe get a confession on camera.
Make sure the parking lot's locked down, no one in or out.
By the way, how did you hear about this place?
Someone tipping you off?
I just did some old-fashioned investigating.
<i>Detective,</i> <i>I got a guy here looking to deliver a pizza.</i> All right, hold onto him.
This will all be over in a moment.
Tom Gladden!
 Uh, who's Tom Gladden?
 A very dangerous man whose door you were about to knock on, armed only with a microphone.
I was here to talk to Lizzie Hill.
What? No, Lizzie Hill is dead.
Her husband hired Gladden to kill her.
 You don't have to be so rough!
 Let's go.
Wait. That-that's...
Lizzie Hill. She's the one who hired the hit man...to kill Edgar.
<i>Got a runner!</i> Edgar?
Damn you, Lizzie.
And you, too, Tom!
 I'm so confused.
 I'm so confused.
<i>A shocking new development</i> <i>in the story of the kidnapping and attempted murder</i> <i>of local contractor Edgar Hill.</i> In a bizarre turn of events, three suspects are in custody tonight, <i>including Mr. Hill himself,</i> <i>as well as his wife Elizabeth Hill,</i> <i>and Tom Gladden,</i> <i>an employee at a local hardware store.</i> Okay. You want to tell me what happened?
Those two are crazy.
<i>Edgar was a regular.</i> <i>Came in all the time. Seemed like a nice guy.</i> <i>Couple of months ago, he mentioned</i> <i>he might have a job for me, real good pay.</i> <i>Told me what a terrible mistake his marriage had been,</i> <i>that his wife was a horrible person.</i> <i>Gold digger, abusive.</i> Never kept the house tidy.
Abusive how? Physically?
He did not say. I did not wish to pry.
I would never have considered taking such a job, but he was willing to pay me $100,000.
<i>And the fact that I had some financial hardships,</i> <i>and that she was such a terrible woman,</i> <i>I decided to help him out.</i> I was tired of living in my van.
So you took the job, decided to kill Lizzie Hill.
<i>And then? I saw her.</i> <i>And I knew Edgar had lied to me.</i> (Puccini's "O Mio Babbino Caro" plays) <i>  She was no shrew.</i> <i>She was...beautiful.</i> <i>I know this will sound crazy,</i> <i>but I started to...feel things.</i> <i>I don't know if you'd call it love or not, but</i> <i>I knew I couldn't hurt this woman.</i> <i>I couldn't just walk away.</i> <i>I mean, Edgar could find another guy.</i> <i>Someone less discerning of Lizzie's nature.</i> <i>I had to warn her.</i> So you told her the truth?
 Every bit of it.
 And what'd she say?
<i>Where the hell was he getting $100,000?</i> He's been crying poverty for months and then, suddenly, he has the cash to hire a guy to kill me?
I wanted to know what the hell was going on.
<i>Tom called me</i> out of the blue, said we had to meet.
<i>Starts going off about money, how he can't do the job</i> <i>unless I'm willing to pay him his fee up front.</i> <i>I offered him a grand. He refused.</i> <i>I would like it noted for the record that,</i> up until this time, I had not yet committed a crime.
<i>Tom took my car, so when I said</i> <i>I was carjacked, it wasn't completely a lie.</i> <i>I told Lizzie what Edgar told me.</i> <i>That he didn't have the money yet, and he was gonna pay me</i> <i>once he collected the life insurance.</i> What is he talking about?!
She was not happy.
So she decided to turn the tables on her husband then, <i>have you kill him instead.</i> It was self-defense.
He was gonna kill me if I didn't kill him first.
And how were you gonna pay him?
It was not my finest hour.
<i>Two days later, Tom calls me.</i> Says she's dead.
<i>I say "Great. Show me some proof."</i> <i>But he doesn't want to send photos.</i> <i>Says it has to be in person.</i> <i>So I drove out to meet him.</i> She's over here.
<i>He, uh, took me to this grave in the woods.</i> <i>But when I looked inside, it was empty.</i> <i>That's the last thing I remember.</i> Is it done?
Oh.
Oh. I hope he rots in hell.
I plead extreme emotional disturbance.
<i>When we found out that Edgar wasn't dead, we panicked.</i> Thought it was best to get out of town, figure out what to do next.
Still don't know how Edgar found us.
There's an app for that.
Now you sure you want to confess to everything without a lawyer present?
I think I'll be safer in prison.

And Molly seemed excited about fussing over a baby she can give back before it turns into a resentful teenager.
Though if she starts talking about having another one, I'm never speaking to you again.
I'm glad to see you doing well.
You seem happy.
You don't.
Still trying to carry the world's problems on your shoulders?
Well, Maddie's been gone a month.
And here I am on her trail like freaking Columbo.
Driving across the country.
Letting my kid have important milestones in motel rooms.
I'd say she won't hold it against you, but eventually, they hold everything against you.
You know Maddie leaving wasn't your fault, right?
I know that she was depressed.
I don't know how bad it was, but...
Maybe she didn't want you to know.
Or maybe I didn't want to see it.
She was struggling.
And I felt like there wasn't anything I could do other than drive her to her appointments or remind her to take her pills.
So whenever she would tell me she was okay, I'd let myself believe it 'cause it was easier that way.
For me.
You know, so I could go to work, put on a happy face, not be filled with terror every freaking moment.
It was great for me, not so good for her.
Look, you screwed up.
I mean, you did, right?
 Yeah.
 And you're about to do it again.
Maddie's got this voice inside her head whispering lies right now.
Telling her she's worthless, that she's a burden.
That everybody she loves would be better off without her.
 I know.
 So how do you think she's gonna feel when you show up on her doorstep, looking like a man who's just been on a month-long bender?
You're gonna confirm every terrible, dark thought she's ever had, and the cycle of blaming each other...
It's gonna continue, and you two are gonna spiral further and further apart.
 I can't give up.
 No. No.
You can take a minute, or you can take a breath.
You can pull <i>yourself</i> together.
So that eventually, when you do find her, you can be the Howie that she needs.
You know, it's funny. Almost no one calls me "Howie" anymore.

And I don't want him to leave without knowing that.
Well, that's sweet.

 Did you get into room 318? <i>-Negative.</i> 318 was lost to the fire.
Well, the little boy just called me back.
Uh, hold on, he-he's alive?
 Where is he? <i>-He's still saying 318.</i> <i>Is it possible you were at the wrong room?</i> No, but I think he was.
 Is there an 81  E in the hospital?
Yes. On the fifth floor.
He was reading, he was reading a reflection!
Let's go!
<i>They're on five.</i> <i>nce you get past the elevators,  O</i> <i>they're the third room on the left.</i> Copy that. Almost there!
74! 76!
 75!
 Let's go! Keep going, keep going!
This is 82!
Hey, there we go -- that's 318 backwards.
 LAFD! Anyone in there?
Fire department!
Baby's alive.
His pulse is stable, but he's out.
Must've been the smoke.
 There you go. It's okay.
I got you.
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
<i>Dispatch, this is Firefighter Diaz.</i> <i>Got both kids alive.</i> <i>Evacuating now. Let's go, let's go!</i> Thank you.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Not now.
You don't need to be in here.
Well, I just thought you might like to know the kids are okay.
The little boy Parker and his baby sister.
They found them.
 What?
 The little boy.
He gave you the wrong room number.
What-what do you...?
How is that possible?
He called back.
He saw the numbers in a reflection in the hall.
You figured that out?
A firefighter did when I radioed him.
So I guess you could say this was a group effort.
 You were part of that, too.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Take all the time you need.
 Okay.
 I'll be here.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank...
I need as much help over here as possible.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Make your way over here! Let's go!
Athena.
Anything?
No.
Nothing.
Bobby!
Um, excuse me.
Where's David?
Have you seen him? I-I think he's in one of the ORs.
Well, he should've been evacuated by now.
What's he still doing in there?
He was in the middle of surgery  when the explosion happened.
 He didn't come out.
I think he's still in there.
You got to find him, Bobby.
I will see what I can do.
He can't die on me.
He is not gonna die.
He's lost 250 cc's and counting.
Let's have blood on standby.
 On it.
 There's the aneurysm.
It's already ruptured.
I need a clip to stop the bleeding.
Generator failure. We are on battery backup.
Start a timer. We've got 20 minutes.
Internal bleeding, compact fracture.
She lost a lot of blood, but her vitals are good.
What about him?
Broken neck. No signs of life.
Hey.
You okay?
I was supposed to save him.
Not the other way around.
You did everything you could, Ravi.
I don't see how you do this.
I have faith in Bobby.
And so should you.
 David.
 I can't now, Bobby.
We need to evacuate now.
If I walk out of this room, this man dies, and I can't let that happen.
I promised his wife.
And I promised your husband.
Michael's not my husband.
Well, he wants to be.
He's standing outside this hospital right now with a ring in his pocket -- or maybe a watch, I'm not sure -- waiting to propose.
 I have to finish.
 I'll give you ten minutes.
I need 12.
I will do my best.
All available units, respond to OR Five for defend in place.
<i>I repeat, all available units,</i> <i>respond to OR Five for defend in place.</i> Cap needs us. Let's go! Come on!
<i>Unit 153 responding. Copy.</i> <i>162 en route.</i> <i>243 responding</i> <i>to defend in place.</i> <i>All right, I want a unit on each floor.</i> <i>e've got to stay ahead ofW his thing. Now go, go, go, go! t</i> Two more floors. Let's go.
<i>We're gonna give them 12 minutes.</i> Excuse me, miss, are you going to be okay?
My husband was in surgery, <i>and I haven't seen him yet.</i> Can we pray with you?
Okay.

He didn't make it.
And I'm not so sure we would have, either, without him.

Sure.
"Dear Callie...
All my life, I've been one of the unlucky ones." <i>Glass half full because</i> <i>that's simply all life had to offer me.</i> <i>So when I got cancer, I thought, "Of course."</i> <i>Just another small pour from life to me</i> <i>as we clinked our glasses for one final goodbye.</i> <i>But when you came into that chemo room</i> <i>with a smile on your face,</i> <i>you changed my perspective.</i> <i>Taught me that I could pour myself a tall glass</i> <i>and stay a little while longer if I fought like hell.</i> <i>And we did.</i> <i>I beat it.</i> <i>We beat it.</i> <i>Together.</i> <i>am eternally grateful for youI</i> <i>and your faith in me the last three years.</i> <i>pray to God I will not see youI nside this hospital again,i</i> <i>but I sure do hope to see you</i> <i>on the other side.

Rupert?
I spent practically my entire childhood in hospitals.
Those doctors and nurses become your family.
I didn't know that.
It's not exactly fun party talk.
It was chemo on the weekends instead of soccer tournaments.
But those people cheered me on just the same.
They saved my life.
So I get why he ran back into the building.
To pay it forward.
I guess that's why you do it, too.
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
Better.
Thanks for earlier.
Not sure I really did anything.
no crying at work.
Least I didn't do it on the floor.
Sorry you had to see that.
Don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see anything.
 Oh, let's see the bling.
 Ooh!
Nice. It's amazing.
All right, everybody.
As it turns out, I have one more announcement to make.
Go for it, Dad.
Okay, as you know, David is going to use his incredible gifts to help those in need in Haiti.
All right. Mm, aw.
 Yeah, that's so wonderful. And, uh, I've decided to go with him.
You know, I-I can't save lives, but I can help rebuild one.
Dad.
Now, Harry has already given me his approval, and I hope that you would, too.
That's amazing.
I'm really proud of you.
Oh.
I learned from watching you.
All of you, really.
You know, with, uh, my brain tumor and then the pandemic and-and then my job, you know, at times, I-I really felt a...
Felt a little lost.
But last night, I watched people come together and save someone that they didn't even know.
More than one.
And I said to myself, "I can do that, too." That's wonderful, Michael.
I mean, not in an actual fire, because that's terrifying, you know, and you people are crazy.

"9-1-1" all new, Mondays.
This thing is holding on by a thread, Cap!
And watch other Fox shows, like "Our Kind of People," "The Big Leap," and "The Resident" on Fox.
You can do this, Gabi.
Just make a few turns and stops, park, and don't run over anyone.
Easy as can be.
Morning. My name is Chloe.
I will be your proctor for the road test portion of your California driving exam.
Hi.
 I'm Gabi.
 In your own time, Gabi.
Does that mean I should start?
We started when I got in the car, but it does mean your vehicle can move now.
Great.
Let me just secure my seatbelt.
<i>Just moved here from Brooklyn.</i> Take a right up here at Alvarado.
A right. Got it.
Never had to drive there, but I guess everyone here spends half their lives in their car.
Eyes on the road, please.
What are you writing down?
Is it about how I took my eyes off the road?
 I won't do that again.
 You were supposed to take a right.
Oh, crap. I'm sorry.
I've already failed, haven't I?
 The light.
 What?
 The light.
Definitely failed.
Again.
That's why I moved here, you know?
To the land of mandatory motor vehicles and terrible bagels and egg rolls that are really spring rolls.
Bad breakup.
She said I was weak and didn't know how to face my problems.
So I left town.
I'm not unaware that, in running away, I kind of proved her point.
Just keep moving.
Right. That's what I'm doing.
Trying to move on.
 Green light.
You did the right thing.
Okay, I swear I knew what a green light meant before I started this test.
No. I mean, moving out here.
Whoever she was, she's in your rearview now.
Thanks.
 That wasn't me.
You said "we." <i>Who else is in the car with you?</i> The woman from the DMV is in the passenger seat.
Her name's Chloe. I'm Gabi.
<i>I was taking my driver's test.</i>  Okay. Are either of you injured?
 I'm fine, but Chloe, she has a pen <i>-stuck in her chest.
 Is it deep?</i> I don't know.
What's deep when there's a pen in your chest?
 How does that even happen? Oh, God. <i>  Airbags.</i> Stay with me, Gabi. As long as that pen stays in, she should be okay. Is she conscious?
Yes.
 But she's having trouble breathing.
That can't be good, right?
<i>-The pen might've punctured her lung.
 Should I...</i> do something?
Just keep an eye on her and stay on the line.
Fire and rescue are arriving now.
<i>Dispatch, this is Captain Nash.</i> 118. Please advise DWP to shut <i>the power off on this street.</i> <i>Have them contact CalGEM to send a team of engineers</i> <i>to cap this well.</i> What is the status of our victims?
<i>Gabi, the driver, appears uninured,</i> but it sounds like her passenger, Chloe, might have a brachial puncture wound.
 How's her breathing?
 Described as labored.
<i>Copy that.</i> Okay, Ravi, I want you to start foaming this area.
We don't want any accidental sparks igniting this oil.
<i>How we doing in there, Gabi?</i> I think her breathing's worse.
Are they getting us out?
They're working on it.
See if we can get that hatch open.
Help! Get us out!
Ah, it's jammed. Give me the Jaws. Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, negative, negative.
Buck, stop. Stop.
We're on top of an oil well.
Isn't that why we have the foam?
No, the foam is just a Band-Aid.
It's good for a spark or two, but we start cutting into metal, this whole thing's gonna go.
Ask the driver how her breathing sounds.
<i>Any gurgling or choking?</i> Gabi, can you tell me how Chloe's breathing sounds?
<i>Any gurgling?</i> I'm not sure.
I can't hear anything in here.
Can you move in closer?
Seat belt.
Gonna...
have to...
dock you...
Oh, jokes. Guess you're feeling better.
Uh-huh.
<i>Caller says there's a little gurgling.</i> Hey.
We shatter the back of the glass, then go in.
No sparks with glass.
But we got to cut through the seats to get to them, and again...
Tools and sparks.
 Yeah.
 What if we, uh, we shatter the moonroof?
You know, we pull them up and out.
No, no, no. Look at the flow of that geyser.
 We bust that glass, they're gonna drown in oil. Hey! Hey!
One of them has a sucking chest wound.
If we don't get them out, she's gonna drown in her own blood.
 We can't wait.
 We need someone to cap that well.
Well, maybe we cap it ourselves.
Let's go.
You didn't...
What?
Run.
Still...here.
Where would I go? I don't have a license.
Oh!
 Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!
<i>-No! Chloe!
 Gabi? What's happening?</i> The pen fell out. She's bleeding, bad.
Okay. I need you to apply pressure to the wound.
You have anything in the car, like <i>-a clean cloth?
 Um, I...</i>  Napkins. <i>  Great.</i> <i>Just wad them all up and make a pad.</i> <i>Then hold it against the wound and apply direct pressure.</i> Tight. We just need to slow down the bleeding.
 For how long? <i>  Fire and rescue will be able to get to you in just a minute.</i>  Okay. <i>  They just need to move your car.</i> Okay -- What? Move it where?
Come on, everybody. Let's go. Let's push.
All right, let's push, let's go.
Everybody push.
Push!
It's going, it's going. Push, guys, push.
That's it. Let's go. Push, push, push.
Keep going. That's it.
Push. Push. That's it. Keep going. Yeah.
<i>What happens now?</i> <i>They're gonna break the sunroof,</i> so I need you both to shield your eyes.
Okay. We're ready.
Glass breaking. Three, two, one.
It's okay, Chloe. Help is here. You're gonna be okay.
 Bag. All right.
 Yeah.
 Let's get you out of there.
 No. I'm fine.
Help her first. She's not talking anymore.
We save you, and we can get in here and save her.
All right, take my arm.
All right. I got you.
Definitely a deep puncture.
Pulse is still strong. Eddie, I'm gonna need a...
Three-sided dressing, coming up.
Damn it.
The oil wants out.
Our weight's the only thing keeping it contained.
Ready to move.
Hen. Hen, we got to go! Come on.
Let's go, let's go.
I hope she's insured.

I'd ask the same question, but I really don't want to know the answer.
You yearned for the freedom of your own apartment, why aren't you there?
I had to come get my mail.
Have you never heard of a Change of Address form?
Definitely about to look into it.
I don't want to disturb whatever situation this is, so I'm gonna go get my mail.
Oh, oh, not in here, not in here.

Uh, it's just all I could find in the kitchen to cover up.
So you weren't wearing -- No.
I'm just gonna stop myself right there.

 I'll get it. Uh, May, could you...

There's over 5,000 known oil wells in L. A., but there are a bunch that were just basically forgotten.
You know, they-they dried up, they filled them with trash and covered them.
It's like the-the ticking time bomb that could be sitting in your backyard right now.
Uh, Tay?
 Taylor.
 Huh?
Oh, I-I was just, uh, I was pitching you a great story.
Uh, I-I did the-the promo tease.
Yeah. I, uh...
Big, um...
oil well...time bombs.
It's great.
Hey, are-are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm just tired.
Haven't really slept well in the last few days.
I should go home.
Maybe I'm just sleep-deprived enough to actually get  a full night's rest.
 Uh, well-well...
Hold on. Wh-Why don't you, uh, why don't you stay here?
You don't need to drive all the way across town just to sleep.
Stay here. I'll-I'll make you breakfast in the morning, and, yes, by make I mean I'll put some frozen waffles in the toaster.
Sorry. Um...
Waffle rain check?
Yeah. Sure.
 Good night.
 Good night.
<i>I think it's over.</i> <i>-Uh, me and Taylor.</i> She went home to get some sleep.
How is that code for it's over?
Well, what's past is prologue, right?
And, based on my past, Taylor and I have reached the point in a relationship where the woman flees.
Women flee you?
 Routinely?
Starts out small. Uh, she's-she's canceling plans.
She's got to work. She needs to wash her hair or do her laundry, and before you know it, poof.
Dropping them off at the airport and never seeing them again.
Okay, Buck, you're being a little too Buck about this.
A little? When was the last time a woman told you she had to go home to wash her hair? 1952?
Listen, Taylor is not Abby or Ally. It doesn't even rhyme.
I mean, that's a good sign, right?
The thing is...
I-I think she might've been living with me.
I mean, we never explicitly said that, but she's there all the time.
I...It sure feels like we were living together.
Why does this keep happening to you?
Well, to be honest, I think...
No. I'm gonna tell you why.
Because you don't talk to the women you're dating.
You just go with the flow and find yourself in a relationship with no idea how you got there or what to do when things start to go wrong.
Yeah. Who does that?
My point is, breaking up is not inevitable.
You can turn it around.
You just have to make the effort.
Talk to Taylor. Tell her how you're feeling.
Find ways to reconnect.
Cap knows of what he speaks.
Apparently, May walked in on him and Athena reconnecting in the kitchen the other night.
Oh, God. Parental nightmare.
Well, apparently, my wife has been oversharing.
I mean, I just wasn't aware that we were able to bring our gear home for recreational purposes.
 Aw...
You've been playing sexy firefighter, Cap?
What makes you think that I was the firefighter?
Oh, come on.
I don't want to think about that, and...now I can't stop.
Tejada.
 You called it in?
 Yeah. I was driving by, and I saw the hood up, and that's when I saw him.
He was breathing, but he didn't respond  when I tried to talk to him.
 Trying to charge his engine.
Looks like he gave himself a shock.
He must've fallen and hit his head.
Sir, can you hear me?
Sir, can you hear me?
I'm with the LAFD.
You took a pretty nasty fall, so...
we're gonna just check you out, okay?
Antonia?
Pupils are equal and reactive.
BP is stable.
Sir, what's your name?
Clive Wexler.
Do you know where you are?
Flat on my back in the driveway in front of my house, unfortunately.
Wilson. Antonia Wilson?
What year is it?
 That's usually our question. Well...
Antonia Wilson is my mother, but...
though I don't think I've ever heard anyone call her by that name.
Antonia's daughter?
 You two know each other?
 Knew.
She and I were friends.
Good friends, when we were younger, but I haven't seen her since...
got to be over 40 years ago now.
Doesn't seem to be fractured.
Let's cover the wound and transport him to the hospital.
So you and my mom were close?
I certainly thought so, but if I know Toni, she wouldn't want me discussing her personal business,  even with her own daughter.
Especially with her own daughter.
Antonia was always a snappy dresser.
Her coat of armor was her favorite piece, if you know what I mean.
I understood, though.
You catch enough shrapnel and, eventually, you don't want to leave any part of yourself exposed.
So, if you knew my mom back then, then you probably knew my dad, too.
He was the shrapnel.

They really shouldn't have called you.
It's not a big deal.
Caller said something about $1 million missing.
Well, yeah, but you guys are about 30 years too late.
The robbery happened in 1987?
Guy held up one of our blackjack tables, made off with a million two in chips, sped away on a motorcycle, and was never heard from again.
And I'm here why?
Someone tried to cash one of the stolen chips this morning.
Who?
Pretty sure this face wasn't even born in '87.
'94.
 Neil...
"Bee-sco..."  Biscobing.
Rhymes with "disco king." Sorry. Old family joke.
If you say so.
Explain the chip, Neil.
Well, I'm a bell-ringer for Santa's Helping Hand, and someone must've put it in my bucket.
Didn't see who.
Didn't even notice the chip until I was on my lunch break.
And then you decided to try and cash it.
It'd feed thousands of families.
You said that no one ever saw the robber's face.
Any chance you saw the rest of him on one of your cameras inside?
Maybe it will jingle Kris Kringle's memory.
We wouldn't have that footage anymore.
Everything would've been turned over to the police in '87.
And I'm sure your people have already tossed it in the trash by now.
You'd be surprised how inefficient we are.
Neil, write down your number.
If I find the robber, you might remember him.
Clive Wexler.
I'm surprised you don't remember him, 'cause he sure remembered you.
I remember Clive.
It was just a long time ago.
Where'd you even meet him?
On a case.
Yeah, a police officer found him unconscious in his driveway.
Is he all right?
Mm-hmm. He's fine.
He was just fixing an old convertible and shocked himself, so he ended up with a bump on the head.
He still has that car?
He said you two went way back.
He wasn't that forthcoming, though, with the details on how you knew each other.
You know, from the neighborhood.
I'm home.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Oh, let me help you with that.
Ah, thank you. Kids not in?
Karen took Harry and Denny to get some ice cream.
 Oh. What about May?
 Uh, said she couldn't make it.
Scarred for life.
What's up with the box?
Uh, evidence from an old cold case.
Actually, it's why I called you here.
I need a consultant.
Me?
Someone robbed The Fairwell Casino.
 When? I didn't hear about that.
 1987.
And they got away?
They usually don't make it out the front door.
Usually don't make it out with all their teeth, either.
Let me get you some wine.
Thank you, baby.
 Thanks.
 So how much are we talking?
A million in chips.
Guy in a motorcycle helmet came in, drew a gun on the dealer, then cleared them out.
How many tables did he hit?
Well, as far as I know, just the one.
That's a lot of money for one table.
When I was a dealer, we used a 12 barrel tray with 60 chips per barrel.
Depending on the time of day, I might have anywhere from...
a hundred grand to half a mil at my table.
Hmm. It was 8:00 a. m. on a Wednesday.
Must've been a special request from a high roller.
It's not uncommon, but, usually, somebody has to sign off on a request.
Hmm, y'all do that a lot at casinos?
If we know them? Sure.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
 And it's our job to make that parting as easy as possible.
Savage.
A million dollars.
Don't get too excited.
Even if I find it,  we can't keep it.
 Yeah.
It's an interesting mystery, though.
A masked man gets away with a million dollars.
Never seen or heard from ever again.
And the chips never turned up, either?
Not until today.
Wait a minute. D. B. Cooper only made away with 200,000, and how many books and documentaries have there been about him?
And yet we've never heard of this biker bandit?
Ooh, I like that. Catchy.
Casinos pride themselves on their security.
Can't have people thinking it's like knocking over a 7-Eleven.
Damn, Ma. You really know everything about casinos.
I worked there.
And maybe our thief did, too.
Uh, hey.
 You're here.
 Hi.
I, uh, thought you said, like, an hour ago you couldn't come over tonight.
Uh, I was looking for my tablet. I think I left it here.
Uh, yeah.
Uh...
Ah. Thank you.
Uh, why don't you stay for dinner?
Uh, can't. Got an early flight in the morning.
Hey, wh-what's going on?
First you're in here sneaking around trying to grab your stuff, and now you're...
you're skipping town?
I'm not skipping town, Buck.
Taylor, if you're gonna break up with me, then just...
Who said anything about breaking up?
It's just for a day or two.
We can talk about it when I get back.
No!
No, I'm sorry, but we-we can't.
We're gonna talk about it now, 'cause if you're gonna be weird and distant, and then just take off, you cannot expect me not to worry.
At least tell me where you're going.
My father's parole hearing.
<i>I was the one who found her.</i> The coroner ruled it a suicide.
Then, eight months later, they came back and arrested my father.
So your dad killed your mom.
Well, that's what the second jury said.
The first one was a little more split on their feelings.
And what about your feelings?
A much more complicated story.
He's my dad.
There's a part of me that could never believe he could have done this.
But it's not like I can imagine my mother doing that to herself.
So you just spent all these years not knowing?
Everybody had a theory.
My mom's family, my dad's family.
Living in between the two was pretty...messy.
And now I have to go in front of a parole board and convince them that he's a good person who deserves a second chance.
Whoa, hey, there's gotta be a way for us to find out what really happened.
You know, maybe we could, uh, we could take another look at the case.
You think I haven't?
I have talked to family, friends, investigators.
It all came back to the same place.
Only two people know what really happened.
And one of them is dead.
 And the other one?
 Swears he's innocent.
Wait, well, let me come with you at least.
You know, I can get a plane ticket, and...
No.
I don't want that.
This isn't your childhood trauma, Buck, it's mine.
I need to deal with this on my own.
Bobby.
 What are you doing up?
 You gotta check this out.
No, no, no, no, I'm not checking anything out.
Come to bed. Those tapes will be there in the morning.
 It'll only take a second. Come on.
 No, no.
 Okay, here he is right after he hit the table.
 Mm-hmm.
Now, security scrambles as soon as they know  that there's a robbery happening, right?
 Mm-hmm.
Here they are, right on his heels.
 As they should be.
 But now, watch this.
 Oh...
 Here he is, seconds after.
Where are the guards?
 Exactly.
Run that back.
How'd he get such a huge lead?
That is the $1.2 million question.
You still think it was an inside job?
Well, Toni said someone would have to approve the extra chips on the table,  so security probably knew.
 Look at them stop there.
 I mean, maybe they did do it on purpose.
 Inside job.
Eliminate the impossible, and only the improbable remains.
Oh, yeah. O-Okay, Sherlock.
 All right, run that back.
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.
Mm, I don't suppose there's any way you could fix that.
Well, I mean, I could try to piece it together, but...
Mm-mm.
Or, there is another way we could test our theory.
What other way?
Rob the casino.
<i>"From the neighborhood"?</i> Yep. That's all she said.
Like he was some guy she used to see on the corner or something.
She used to definitely see him, all right.
Right?
I wasn't just imagining that.
Clive and Toni were definitely a thing.
And I mean, like, big time, long-lost-love kind of thing.
My abuela would eat this up. She loves a good telenovela.
Oh, 'cause, uh, 'cause you don't?
Come on, I know you watch 'em with Christopher.
That's how we practice our Spanish.
 Uh-huh.
 Real question is, what happens next in the story?
Well, I-I do have his number.
I could call him.
I mean, just to see how he's doing after his fall.
 Of course.
 Whoa, hold on, you don't know why they broke up, right?
I mean, I mean, what if there's some deep trauma that shouldn't be poked at?
Since when did you become the voice of reason?
 Did something happen with Taylor?
 Uh, no, you just -- You guys were right, she's not breaking up with me.
That's all you're giving us? We still got...Oh.
 Okay.
 Three minutes?!
 Whoo!
How the hell did you manage to shave almost three minutes off of Buck's best coffee run time?
It's called a mobile order, Hen. Walked in and the drinks were waiting.
This just better be oat milk.
Damn it, he even got the order right.
<i>Club sodas,</i> shaken, not stirred.
For you I get, but for me?
 We're working here.
 Are we?
'Cause it feels a little more like we're playing.
Not to say that I mind.
I'm gonna need a little vodka  in this club soda.
 Yes, miss.
So the high rollers were over here.
There was over a million dollars' worth of chips right over there.
And from what I remember about the tape, security was way over there.
 Hmm.
 All right, let me have your purse.
Oh. It doesn't really go with that outfit.
You don't think?
Okay, I'm the biker bandit, you're security.
You take your position, and as soon as I grab this, you come after me, and I'll try and escape.
We are taking this role-playing a little more public than necessary.
We retrace his steps, we'll figure out how the bandit got away.
 If you say so.
 Just remember, it's not so much about the speed as it is about the distance.
So if you match my pace, it should work out.
 Then let's play.
 Let's play.
♪ <i>All this talking, not much doin'♪</i> ♪ <i>People screaming, not much doin'♪</i> ♪ <i>I get tired of all this play...♪</i>  You didn't run.
 I matched your pace.
All right, let's do it again.
♪ <i>I'm driving down the same old track♪</i> ♪ <i>Too much weight on my back</i>♪  Let's do it again.
♪ <i>I'm at the end of the road</i>♪ ♪ <i>So brother, lighten my load.</i>♪ Okay, all right, it happens right around here every time in this blind spot, so why didn't security catch him?
Because he doubled back.
Valet and the motorcycle is over there.
And somehow he was able to leapfrog them somewhere in here and head out that door.
 Mm-hmm.
 I mean, the only other possibility is that door.
I just don't see how he could make it from there to there.
Bobby, there's an entire racetrack and grandstand out there.
Now, he could have jumped over the seats  and doubled back out there.
 Miss? Here you go.
Thank you.
The fire extinguishers.
I can't believe I didn't catch this before. Look.
Per code, they have to be three feet off the ground.
Now, on his way in, our biker bandit looks to be  about six feet tall.
 Mm-hmm.
But when he leaves...
The robber is shorter going out than when he came in?
He didn't double back, he had a double.
 What do you think, like, five seven, five eight?
 Yeah.
Sergeant Grant.
Didn't think you were working this case anymore.
This is my husband, Bobby Nash.
 Just wanted to show him the place.
 Mm.
Yeah, she was telling me all about your biker bandit.
 My what?
 The thief.
Just a little name I came up with for him.
Did you work here then?
 I did. I was a dealer.
 Oh.
But not that morning. I was in class.
Business school. Student by day, blackjack dealer by night.
And now you're running the place.
Well, I didn't want to stand at a table forever.
Well, listen, while you're here, you should check out the restaurant.
We'd be happy to comp you both a nice meal, a nice bottle of wine...
 Oh, well...
 That's kind. Very kind.
But we couldn't accept.
Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
 Well, that was interesting.
 Hmm.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Five seven.
Maybe five eight.
Biscobing. Rhymes with "disco king."  You remembered.
 Not a common name.
I ran across it again this morning.
There was a Jimmy Biscobing that was a regular at the Fairwell back in '87.
That was my uncle.
He passed away weeks ago from stomach cancer.
Sorry for your loss.
He gave you the chip before he died?
I found it as my dad and I were cleaning out his place.
That's not all I found.
 Jimmy.
 You two were a thing?
No one knew.
The bosses frowned on employees dating players.
Probably afraid you'd give them inside information?
Like how to rob a casino, for instance?
There needed to be two of you.
<i>One for the guards to chase out front,</i> <i>and another to slip out the back with the money.</i> It wasn't like we were stealing; the casino got the chips back.
Cashing out.
<i>We tossed the high-value chips. We knew those were</i> <i>too easy to trace.</i> Sorry, forgot one.
<i>We split the rest.</i> <i>I used my share to finish school,</i> <i>get my MBA, move up in the company.</i> <i>And Jimmy's share?</i> Player busts.
<i>They got that back, too.</i> Am I under arrest?
There isn't anything we can do legally about it at this point.
Believe me, I looked.
But I did speak with your employers.
Did they really have to know?
I could have retired early, kept it quiet.
And I don't really do quiet.
Buck?
I told you not to come.
Uh, you know me.
I don't always listen.
Are you okay?
No.
I couldn't do it.
Stand up and say he deserves a second chance when...
I'm not sure he does.
Uh, well, that-that must have been really hard.
Like, kind of brave, though.
You know? Uh...
To admit how you, how you really feel.
He told me I was a terrible daughter.
After everything he'd done for me and...how he'd always been there for me,  and I was letting him down.
 No. Hey, hey, hey, you're not.
You're not, okay?
You were doing what was right for you.
And if he can't understand that...
Maybe you should have talked to him.
Guess we both came all this way for nothing.
There are no answers here.
That's not why I came.
I'm only here for you.
In case you needed me.
Haven't been here in forever.
Hasn't really changed much at all.
Did you used to, uh, come here a lot?
I don't remember that.
Way before your time.
So, what's going on?
I know you didn't bring me out for pizza alone just because.
What's this terrible news you're about to spring on me?
It's not terrible, it's just...
Hello, Antonia.
Clive.
These are for you.
It's good to see you again, Antonia.
Thank you.
You look well.
Not as good as I looked 30 years ago, but, then again, time does that to a man.
Well, would you like to join us, Clive?
I can find us a...
Enough, Henrietta. I'm not staying.
I'm sorry, Clive, but...you came here for nothing.
 Antonia...
 I'm-I'm so sorry.
Let me go talk to her.
Mom! Ma, are you okay?
 I-I, I didn't mean to...
 Yes, you did!
It's who you are.
 You can never leave well enough alone.
 No, I just...
The past is the past for a reason, Henrietta.
It's best to just leave it there.
Ah...
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
 About my parents.
Well, that's okay.
I, too, understand a complicated family dynamic that's hard to put into words.
After he went to prison, I went to live with my aunt.
I'd meet new people, and there was always this moment.
This look that would come across their face when they realized who I was.
It was like, you know, I could see what they were thinking.
"Oh...you're that girl." So when you got old enough, you moved to a place where no one knew that girl.
I tell other people's stories for a living because I hate telling my own.
Hey...
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
You okay, Ma?
I'm fine.
Are you still upset with me for, uh...
for meddling?
Just feeling a little melancholy.
That's pictures of you and me.
And Dad, not so much.
I'd like to say that was because he was the one with the camera.
But you and I both know that's not true.
He was never there, even when he was.
It was an affair, Henrietta.
Me and Clive.
While I was married to your father.
You're not surprised.
You storming off when the man was trying to give you flowers was a clue.
Last time I saw Clive was 1978.
He asked me to run away with him.
You were gonna leave Dad?
I knew it was wrong, but...
when Clive talked about the future we could have together...
I saw it...
and I wanted it with my whole heart.
But the day I was supposed to meet him, I...
Stood him up.
 I had my reasons.
 W-Why?
Why would you...
Wait. 1978.
Oh, Ma.
Me?
The doctor called the morning we were supposed to go.
I was willing to leave my husband, but I couldn't walk out on the father of my child.
I mean, are you -- Are you even sure that Dad  was-was-was...
 Henrietta.
This ain't <i>Maury Povich.</i> Yes. I'm sure.
What's this?
Clive's number.
I wasn't sure if I should risk your wrath again giving it to you, but...
 now...
 Honey, I think Clive and I are well past our expiration date.
You don't know that.
Maybe the future that you glimpsed back then, maybe it's now, Ma.
And all you need to do is step into it.
You're not...
ashamed of me?
No.
I know that things were never good with Dad, and that you were alone and unhappy for a long time, Ma.
So I'm not ashamed.
I'm just glad that somebody loved you before I did.
Thank you.
 Hey. We're over here.
What are you doing?
Gin. And I'm winning.
Come on. Two out of three.
You just don't know when to quit, do you?
 Well, it's good to see you two...
 What?
Doing old married couple stuff, like playing cards?
 Mm. And solving crime. Mm-hmm.
 We're pretty good at that.
Oh, uh, this is yours.
It got mixed up with my mail the other day.
I got that change of address filed, so you should stop getting my mail soon.
May, you are welcome to stop by anytime.
 With some advance notice. Yep.
I got it. Well, I'm meeting a friend for dinner,  so I'm gonna take off.
 All right, well, have fun.
 Okay, bye. You, too.
 Bye.
Are we having fun?
Oh, we are about to.
 Hi.
 Hi.
Um, I'm not sure what you remember.
You saved my life.
Thank you for that.
My pleasure.
So you're sure you're not mad at me for showing up in Oklahoma?
Well, honestly,  I kind of love you for it.
 Great, 'cause...
What? Hey!
Don't make it weird.
I love you.
Good.
I love you, too.

No Mr. Darcola?
Probably about to take off.
I'm just glad we get him on the actual day this year.
The holidays are always less fun when he's working.
It must be hard that he's away so much.
Wife of a pilot.
At least I get him every other Christmas.

 Ain't that right, Artie? What do we think?
Some kind of road rage incident? Or trolley rage?
Definitely sensing some kind of rage.
Hey, Ravi, you go check on the driver.
Buck and Eddie, you're gonna handle this victim.
Okay, we've got an injured man down on the ground.
Let's give the officers a break.
Can one of you tell me what happened?
This woman is having an affair with my husband.
This woman is lying.
He is my husband. I have a ring and everything.
My husband is wearing a matching one.
You can check it if you don't believe me.
I was asking about the accident.
Pulse is strong but elevated. BP's good.
Right and left ankles are broken.
One for each wife?
He's lucky that's all he's broken.
Left ankle's got an open fracture.
We're gonna give you something for the pain.
Ravi? How's the driver?
Working on it. You sure you're not injured, sir?
No! I'm fine!
How about you come outside and just let me check you for injuries, just to be safe?
Nope.
Safer in here.
Does he have any allergies or underlying medical conditions that my team should be aware of?
Not that I know of. But I didn't know about her, either.
This feels like a lot to keep track of.
Two rings, two phones, and two Christmases.
Sometimes it can make your brain hurt.
Is it hurting right now?
Have any headaches, blurred vision, sensitivity to light?
I did hit my head.
Maybe I could fake amnesia.
Buy some time to help me figure this out.
Yeah. I, uh, I would say your bigger problem is making them forget.
Everything he said to me is a lie.
I'd almost feel bad for you if you hadn't married my husband.
Wait. How old are your boys?
Eight and seven.
Oh, God.
I'm married to her husband.
I'm wife number two, Arthur?!
Please tell me he's ready to transport.
Both ankles are broken pretty badly and I think he's got a compound fracture, but I don't see any major swelling or pooling of blood.
His vitals are steady.
Roll him on three?
One, two, three.
Okay, sir, I'm gonna need you to sign this document saying that you refused medical treatment.
One, two, three.
Okay, let's roll.
<i>♪ Anxious care is now but folly</i> ♪ * <i>Fa, la, la...</i> *  Keep him stable.
Love you! I love you both!
We can work this out!
 Where are you taking him? First Presbyterian.
Do either one of you want to go with him?
Happy holidays.
What do you think?
It's facing the wrong way.
There's a right way?
The skinny side should face the window.
What skinny...
Okay. Yes, boss.
There, that's it.
All right.
We are ready for ornaments.
I see bare spots.
How many lights were you thinking?
Just keep comin'.
That's a lot of lights.
No. Five popcorns. One cranberry.
Is that some kind of rule?
Yes.
Looks great.
We need tinsel. Some sparkle.
Okay.
That's enough decorating for tonight.
Why don't you go, uh, go get ready for bed?
I'll finish up. You can critique my work in the morning.
I just want everything to be perfect.
Oh. Uh...
it will, bud.
All right, come on.
All right.
Night, Dad.
Night, bud.
<i>♪ With every shroud of falling snow</i> ♪ <i>♪ Bring back some precious memory</i> ♪ Do we even have tinsel?
<i>I'm wishing ♪</i> <i>For an old-fashioned...♪</i> Turkey, ham, and a roast?
Well, we're hosting so many people.
I figured, better have too much than not enough.
Well, we're gonna be two less this year without Michael and David.
Oh, three less.
Don't forget I won't be here for dinner, either.
Can't believe you actually wanted to work on Christmas.
That's way worse than all those extra credit projects you used to do in school.
But it pays better. Time and a half better.
Does it make up for missing my mac and cheese?
You'll save me a plate.
Or maybe an entire turkey?
Well, I'm roasting that one. I'm gonna deep-fry this one.
Ooh! Is it gonna explode?
 If I let you cook it.
You know, you could at least appear a little more upset about missing Christmas with your family.
Come on, Mom.
It's not like this is the first holiday one of us in the family had to work.
It's just my turn this year.
Remember when we used to open presents on Christmas Eve?
Stay up all night. That was the best.
You know, speaking of gifts, did you want to open any this year?
I still haven't seen your Christmas list.
Well, I already told you what I want.
Cash is not an acceptable Christmas present,  not in this house.
I will also be accepting gift cards.
I want to buy something that's put in a box  and gift wrapped.
 You can wrap cash.
Pretty sure you can think of something that isn't cash  or a cash equivalent. Right?
 Mm-hmm.
I guess.
 Oh, um, I-I gotta head out.
I'll drop off my presents tomorrow, okay?
All right. Have a good day at work.
 Thank you. Bye. Bye.
 Okay.
That sounds festive.
Bye.
Maybe we can invite the UPS driver for Christmas.
I think he might be more invested in the holiday.
<i>What's wrong with the tree?</i> Everything, apparently.
It was facing the wrong way, he didn't like the way I was stringing the lights, and I was putting the ornaments in the wrong places.
I felt like I was being judged by Martha Stewart.
Pre-Snoop Dogg.
Well, he's growing up.
You know, becoming his own person.
Forming his own opinions.
About the proper popcorn-to-cranberry ratio of garland?
It's five-to-one, just in case you were wondering.
Well, of course it is.
Anything else would be madness.
 Is that Christopher?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
 I'm fine.
 We heard you screaming.
What happened? Did you have a bad dream?
You want to talk about it?
Sometimes talking about it makes it less scary.
It was about Mom.
So if you'd like to make a donation, you can drop off new, unwrapped toys or sports equipment to any fire station across Los Angeles.
They'll be accepting donations through Christmas Eve.
Back to you, Margaret.
She's a hard woman to shop for.
You still haven't bought her anything?
You're running out of shopping days, bud.
Well, it's not that simple.
You know, I've never had to get a Christmas present for a girlfriend before.
Aw.
It's baby's first Christmas in a serious relationship.
I used to have this roommate who'd always break up with his girlfriend right after Halloween.
Now I know why. It's too much pressure.
 Hi.
 Hi.
What did you get Athena for your first Christmas?
An engagement ring.
Oh. No. Not doing that.
No, don't overthink it, Buck.
Just get her something sweet, something she could use but that she wouldn't necessarily buy for herself.
Get her something that lets her know that you know her really well.
Okay, you've just added way too many parameters to this equation. What I was thinking...
Portable generator.
Uh, useful in case of emergency and not something that she would buy for herself.
Someone's gonna be single by New Year's.
It's a good idea.
 It's not.
 It's a good idea.
Cap...
Taylor. Thanks for the coverage.
Helps boost our donations.
Happy I could help.
Maybe you could help with something.
 I have a question.
 What, about your story?
I thought that was all covered.
Uh...
<i>Glory to...♪</i> Do you think Buck would like one of these sweaters?
<i>The newborn king. ♪</i> Oh, no, dearie.
It's just me. I live alone.
<i>Do you know what part of the house</i> <i>the fire is currently burning?</i> Um...I can't really tell.
<i>I just hear the beeping.</i> Ma'am what's your name?
<i>Phyllis. Phyllis Lang.</i> Hello, Phyllis, I think we've spoken before.
 Many times. <i>-Have we?</i> My memory's so bad these days.
<i>My records show</i> that you've called us over a dozen times in the last five years.
Including yesterday.
And you people have been so kind to me.
Answering my calls <i>no matter what time of day or night.</i> Phyllis, are you experiencing an actual emergency?
Do I need to call my firefighters?
I wouldn't mind seeing some firefighters.
They're-they're always so nice.
<i>Yes, but</i> is there a fire they need to put out?
Or did you forget to change the batteries in your smoke detector? Again?
<i>Oh, right.</i> I'm supposed to do that, aren't I?
Twice a year, ma'am.
They make ones you can hardwire.
Well, that sounds complicated.
Do the firefighters do that?
You-you probably need to call an electrician.
What a good idea. Do you know of any?
Ma'am, there are resources for senior citizens.
If you need someone to talk to, <i>-I suggest that you...</i>  I am talking to someone. You.
This is not what 911 is for.
You're tying up our resources and...
<i>I'm sorry.</i> You're very busy. I can call back later.
No! Wait.
 She's back.
So what did the doctor say?
That one nightmare isn't necessarily a reason for concern.
Could be an isolated incident.
But...
What?
I don't think it's an isolated anything.
He's been obsessed with the holidays this year.
How everything has to be perfect.
Now he's waking up screaming, dreaming of his mother?
Shannon came back at Christmas, right?
You think that's what triggered it?
Well, the holidays were always their thing.
You know, cookies and stockings and gingerbread houses.
Maybe I'm not doing it right.
He-he misses his mom.
That-That's not your fault.
So much for the most wonderful time of the year.
Yeah.
It's a real pressure cooker.
Well, he still cheated on you.
Oh, at least I came first.
How does it feel to be runner-up?
You boys really needed to call 911 for this?
I tried several de-escalation techniques.
I talked to them. In a neutral, non-judgmental tone.
Requested they keep their voices down or move their conversation to a private area.
Then this one took a swing at me.
I wasn't aiming for you. You just got in the way.
I have no idea what Artie ever saw in you.
You are so crass and volatile.
Maybe he was tired of this Zen earth mother schtick you've got going on.
I've known you for five minutes, already  I'm bored to tears.
 All right, so you two  are the wives.
 Polygamists.
It's not polygamy.
We didn't choose to be married to the same man.
I can't wait to never see this woman again.
 Same.
 Hey, hey, hey!
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you two are stuck with each other.
You got kids, right?
Two boys.
One girl.
Siblings.
So whatever anger or hurt feelings you're experiencing right now -- however justified -- you've got to figure out a way to put those aside for their sake.
This is a real confusing time for them right now.
And they've already got a part-time father.
They don't need a long-distance mother doing three to six.
Seven years of lying to my face.
I never even suspected.
I did.
Not another family.
But there were times when I thought that there might be someone else.
And you never confronted him?
I always told myself it didn't matter.
Not as long as I was the one he came home to.
But it turns out I'm not even special in that way.
I wasn't good enough for him.
No.
He's the one who isn't good enough.
For either of us.
We deserve better.
Still want to press charges?
Just get 'em out of my hospital.
Happy holidays.
Stop. Stop. Back up.
Mr. Darcola?
Are you here to arrest me?
Not today.
But bigamy is still a crime in all 50 states.
You might want to ask Santa for a lawyer.
Ladies? We good?
So...uh...
what happens now?
We want a divorce.
But it's Christmas.
That's right, ladies.
Fight the real enemy.

And you seem to really love the philharmonic because you go to all those concerts.
So I thought, a Christmas sing-along?
We could go together.
We could even make it a date.
Oh.
Melia...
You have plans, don't you?
No, i...
it's not that. I...
You're not interested.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked you.
I...I didn't mean to cross the line.
I'm...I'm just gonna go.
 Melia! Wait!
 Aah!
Melia!
Oh, my gosh. Melia!
How's she doing, Hen?
She seems to be breathing steadily, Cap.
Okay, Buck, power's been cut. Go ahead and tie it off.
Okay, cable is secure.
This thing's not going anywhere.
Looks like just some minor lacerations.
No sign of blood pooling.
 What happened?
 You took a tumble.
Down an open elevator shaft.
Do you mind explaining how that happened?
We were talking, and she got upset  and tried to run, and then...
 Well, which brings us back to what the hell were you doing with this elevator?
 Fixing it?
 No safety cones. No caution tape.
No signage.
Okay, why don't you and I find someplace where we can have a conversation about proper elevator maintenance  and safety protocols. Let's go. Pupillary responses are equal and reactive.
Reactive.
That's me.
Oh.
I'm really sorry about the present.
And what happened after.
 You got him a Christmas present?
 I tried to.
Tickets to the philharmonic, and I totally freaked out.
Look, I am the one who should be apologizing.
 The tickets kind of triggered me.
 Concert tickets off the list.
 You still haven't figured that out? I've been, uh, weighing up some options.
I'm looking forward to seeing Taylor's reaction to whatever it is on Christmas.
Uh, hey, hey, so, so, what? She's, uh, she just  not your type or...
 Oh, no, she's amazing.
I just hate the philharmonic.
Uh, but-but you go to all those concerts.
Because my ex played the piccolo.
And then she left me for the second trombone.
Ouch.
Does it hurt when I do that?
Everything hurts right now.
I would've said yes.
If it had been anything else, I would have said yes.
 Truth is I've had a crush on you for months.
Oh, you have?
I just didn't know how to tell you.
 Ah, sounds like you guys have more in common than you thought.
Yeah.
 Ow. Ow.
 Sorry.
They're gonna get you to the ER, do some scans, and hopefully, you'll be home for Christmas.
 Can I?
 Go.
Uh, hey, Hen?
About Christmas.
I think me and Taylor are just gonna hang out at my place.
You're gonna bail on Bobby and Athena's holiday extravaganza?
I don't feel all that merry this year.
You know? And I don't want to ruin everyone else's day 'cause I-I'm...
Missing the rest of your family?
Yeah. Me too.
* <i>Silent night...</i> *  Dad.
It's finished.
Okay. I made some hot chocolate  to celebrate the end of construction!
 No!
 Uh...
 My house!
It's ruined!
<i>All is bright...♪</i> Um, maybe we can fix it, okay?
It's ruined.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. We'll make another one. All right? I'll help.
There's no time. It's almost Christmas.
And you're working tomorrow.
What is going on?
Okay? Seems like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to get Christmas right.
Where is this coming from, Chris?
I wanted everything to be perfect.
 You, me, presents and-and stockings.
That sounds pretty good to me, right?
 Hey. Okay, we'll make an even bigger gingerbread house next year, right?
You could be dead next year.
What did you say?
Wasn't sure what to say.
I told him that I loved him, and I promised him that I wasn't going anywhere.
But?
One of the first things they teach you on the job is to never make a promise you're not sure you can keep.
You were trying to reassure your son, who's already lost one parent, that he's not about to lose another.
Bullets don't bounce off me, Carla.
I learned that the hard way.
You still thinking about that?
Now and then.
 Like when I get taken hostage at gunpoint.
 You what?
Happened a few weeks back.
You know, Buck and I got caught up in that prison escape.
Neither of us got hurt, so I didn't see a point in telling you or him.
 But it did remind me that what I do is not without risk.
Okay, I can't lie.
I wish your biggest danger at work was you getting a paper cut.
But I know that your job is important.
Not just to the people you save but to you.
But is it more important than my kid feeling safe when he closes his eyes at night?
Eddie just canceled.
 He and Christopher won't be joining us for Christmas.
That's what, our fifth cancellation?
And we were already working with a limited guest list.
I know.
 This is not the Christmas I thought we'd be having.
 Yeah.
Looks like it's just the Grant-Nashes  and the Wilsons this year.
 What?
Clive surprised Toni with a trip to Cabo, and Hen says that now they're thinking about just going to Karen's family instead this year.
Okay. Well, this is getting depressing.
Are we forcing this?
Throwing some big holiday party to distract us from the people we're missing?
There's still you, me and Harry.
And that's probably all we need.
Mm.
51 Orangethorpe Avenue.
<i>Ma'am, what is the nature of your emergency?</i> <i>-Well...</i>  Mrs. Lang, do you have any reasonable fear <i>that your life r the life of someone you knowo</i> <i>may be in imminent danger?</i> I d-I don't know think I'd go that far.
Then I'm going to have to hang up now.
Happy holidays.
Goodbye.
Wow.
This is a lot of decorations.
Working Christmas Day with Sue is always epic.
Well, there is no such thing as too many twinkle lights.
Lonely Lady called again.
You cannot be serious.
 Mm.
 I got her yesterday.
Lonely Lady?
Our holiday frequent flyer.
She calls every year reporting some sort of emergency  that isn't really an emergency. Well, and newer dispatchers wind up rolling out help because they don't know any better.
She said there was a gas leak.
I sent two houses plus police and the gas company.
Evacuated a five-block radius.
Which would absolutely have been the right call had there been  an actual gas leak.
 Is it some kind of holiday prank?
I think she just wants someone to talk to.
Bonus if she manages to engineer a visit from some first responders.
Or 33 of them.
 Oh. Look, I'm sorry she doesn't have any family, but two firehouses.
Well, I think she does, but they just don't talk anymore.
You know, kids grow up, and sometimes they grow away, too.
Guess we got to call her again.
Give her our annual "stop calling 911" speech.
No.
I think this time we need a stronger deterrent.
 Oh.
 Phyllis Lang?
 Yeah.
 Mind if I come in?
Oh. They sent the police this time.
Would you like something to drink?
No, thank you. This is not a social call, Phyllis.
Misuse of 911 is a crime.
Oh, God.
You came here to...to arrest me?
I came to talk some sense into you.
Is there really no one else that you can call besides a 911 dispatcher? Your family?
Or a therapist?
Only family I have is my daughter.
We-we don't speak much.
My husband -- he-he was, uh, the-the glue that held us together.
Then after he died, I-I guess I figured I had to be the glue, but I-I didn't have his knack for it.
Tighter I tried to hold on, the...further she slipped away.
I have a daughter, too.
And a mother.
Moms and their girls, always complicated.
Things haven't been the same between us since her-her wedding day.
I may have said that I hated her husband and it was never gonna last.
They're married for 12 years.
Two kids.
 Have you tried apologizing to her?
 Oh, I wouldn't know what to say.
Start with "I'm sorry." Go from there.
She doesn't need me anymore.
Last 12 years have proved that.
That doesn't mean she wouldn't like to hear from you.
May be time for you to dial a different number.
Ooh!
 Found everything.
Except for the star that goes on top.
I think it's in one of the storage cabinets down by the parking space.
I'm gonna ask your dad to look for it when he gets home with the tree.
What about the wreath?
It's in here somewhere.
Hey. You better be close.
Yeah, I'm just pulling in.
Hey, I-I think I need you to come help me with this thing.
<i>It's a little bigger than we normally get.</i> How big?
Uh, bigger.
Hugo, that thing better fit in this apartment. We never get  a big tree.
 Is that Dad?
Well, it's all they had left.
The big daddies or the dried out, skimpy ones.
You know, if you had come with me like I asked you to, <i>we could have picked something out together.</i> If someone would have come with me last Saturday like I wanted, <i>this wouldn't be happening, but someone</i> <i>was too busy watching football.-</i> Hey, thank you, sweetheart.
It was my alma mater and the biggest game of the year.
<i>-And they lost.</i> Oh, and we can't find the star.
I think it's in the storage locker.
Ah, damn it!
<i>Why's your car beeping?</i> Because these freaking sensors are too sensitive.
What was that?
Oh. my God!
Please, you got to help us. Please.
My husband's in there. We can't get to him.
Okay, everybody step back.
Okay, looks like he hit this post and took some of the structure down with it.
I don't understand how this happened.
We were on the phone arguing over the Christmas tree, and then all of a sudden, this comes crashing down.
You said you were on the phone with him?
 Yes.
 Has he said anything  since the collapse?
 No.
He just stopped talking.
Okay, Buck, Eddie, Hen, I want you to start clearing this debris carefully.
Everybody else, step back,  give us some room to work. Where do you need me,  Cap?
 I need you evacuating this building.
I'm concerned it's gonna come crashing down any minute.
These structures were supposed to be retrofitted after the Northridge quake, but from the looks of things, landlord didn't get around to it.
Do the residents know that?
They're about to find out.
Cap, he's unconscious, possibly not breathing.
Is he dead? Is Dad dead?
Come here, sweetie. They're gonna get him out.
Come here.
We're ready, Cap. Airbag is in place.
Okay, let's lift it nice and slow.
We need just enough space between the car and the ceiling to pop that door and pull him out.
Okay, that should do it. Eddie, go.
Cap, he's coming around!
Okay, that's good news. Let's get a collar on him and put him on a board.
All right, bud. Hey. That's good.
You got him?
Got you. We got you.
Let's get him on the gurney.
Slowly. Slowly.
Keep him stable. Watch the neck.
Pressure's slightly elevated, probably from the pain, but we can't rule out internal injuries.
Let's start a line.
Watch his legs.
Pupils are reacting but sluggish, likely a concussion.
 He's gonna be okay.
 Thank God.
Hugo.
So, they'll check him out at the hospital for anything that's going on internally.
But you and your son can ride with him in the ambulance.
Thank you so much.
I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to him.
You saved our Christmas.
What?
After they discharge your husband from the hospital, you still can't come back here.
I'm gonna have to red-tag the building.
But Christmas is tomorrow.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just not safe to go back in there.
We have to red-tag the building.
I know tomorrow's Christmas, but it's just not safe to go back in there.
I have notified the Red Cross.
A representative is on the way.
They will be providing housing for you and your families until your building can get sorted out.
Very sorry.
We're really gonna leave them, Cap?
There's nothing else we can do.
Whoa.
Told you.
 You weren't kidding.
 Yeah.
Oh, my God. It's epic.
What?
It's Christmas.
I think this is the first Christmas he hasn't been up at the crack of dawn.
Maybe it doesn't feel like Christmas to him, either.
 Mm.
 Stuck in a motel room.
No tree. No presents.
Hey. It's okay.
We're alive and we're together and that's all that matters, right?
I guess.
Hi.
I'm not sure if you remember me.
You're the firefighter.
You saved my husband.
Yeah.
 What are you doing here?
 Why don't you guys come on outside.
I think Santa found us.
Yeah, I think he did.
Oh, wow.

H-Hold on. First, you're having this deep, intense conversation with Bobby.
Now you gather us here for some announcement?
 What's going on?
 Is everything okay with Christopher?
He's worried about me.
About the risks I take  while I'm at work. Wow.
That's a lot for a ten-year-old to be thinking about.
Yeah. Probably too much.
So I think I have to make a change.
I'm leaving the 118.
@@@@@@
(mariachi band playing) JUDITH: I don't remember ordering so many balloons.
MIGUEL: Ah, relax, baby.
It's gonna be great.
Yeah, but where is she?
Her entire court is waiting.
Well, you know your daughter. She likes to make an entrance.
(sighs) Right. And I know her<i> papi,</i> too, who likes to make a big show out of everything.
Miguel, What did you do?
(speaks Spanish) (both laugh) (sighs) It was all your baby girl, and a little me.
JUDITH: (chuckles) Balloons.
(gasps) Oh, my God!
(Miguel laughing) JUDITH: Oh, my God! (gasps) (cheers and applause) Lourdes! You did it,<i> mija.</i> (Miguel laughs) (Judith gasps) Isn't it amazing?
That isn't safe.
MIGUEL: Baby, it's fine. Look.
There's four ropes, and, no, nothing's gonna happen.
Ay...
(sighs) She looks beautiful.
Lourdes!<i> Mija!</i> You look beautiful.
MIGUEL: You do,<i> mija.</i> You really do.
(wind whooshing) (grunting) (speaks Spanish) Hold her!
(gasps) (screams) Through here, through here.
Hey.
The country club said the building's been vacant for repairs.
That's why nobody heard him hit the roof.
Do you know when this happened?
No.
I saw a crew up there this morning.
So, no more than a few hours. All right.
Keep everybody back.
(speaks Spanish) Got your med kit?
Not my first rodeo.
<i> Mija,</i> this is terrible. The party's ruined.
Are you kidding, Mom?
This is awesome.
JUDITH: Really?
Jonah, Hen, you take the roof.
Buck, we're gonna come at him on the inside.
Ericson, you're up top on the assist.
All right. Up we go, Monday.
Name's Jonah, and you know that.
Why do you keep calling me Monday?
'Cause there's a new one of you every shift.
To me, you're Monday.
He went clear through the roof.
Sir? Sir? Can you hear me?
(groaning) I got a pulse.
Please...
help me.
Easy. Don't move. You don't want to exacerbate your injuries.
What's your name?
Lenny.
JONAH: Paragliding? What happened?
LENNY: Wind picked up. Tried to avoid some...
power lines and lost control.
Pulse is 130. BP's 105/60.
Breathing is fast, but his lungs sound clear.
JONAH: Opening a line.
Pushing ten of morphine.
Hang in there, Lenny. I'm giving you some of the good stuff.
Pretty soon, you won't feel a thing.
Already can't feel my legs.
Lenny, can you wiggle your fingers for me.
How about this? Can-can you feel that? Okay.
Yeah.
JONAH: Lumbar injury?
Spinal compression?
HEN: Possibly.
What if my legs are completely gone?
Don't worry. Don't think you'd be talking to us at all.
We'll have a visual soon enough, okay? Cap.
How we looking down there?
Almost in position.
Uh, hey, Cap, I don't want to be insensitive, but, uh, do his legs look really short?
Oh...
Hen, Jonah, get down here right now.
HEN: Bilateral open knee dislocation.
The impact forced the femurs down through the knee.
Landed on his feet, and his upper legs kept going.
Thinking it's better now that he can't feel them.
Blood loss isn't that bad, considering.
Lucky he didn't sever his femoral arteries.
Do we reset them here?
HEN: Absolutely not.
You know better than to attempt that out in the field.
I heard you like to push the envelope.
Something about having your hand inside of a guy's torso for two hours?
That's an entirely different envelope. Grab the splints.
<i> Ready for extraction, Cap.</i> All right, Lenny, you stay calm.
Things are gonna get a little noisy.
(whirring) (applause) (speaks Spanish) BOBBY: Hey.
Hey.
BOBBY: Ooh, something smells good.
Ah, it should be ready soon. How'd it go?
Well, not too bad for me.
The 153 is the target of choice this time around.
HARRY: I don't understand why they make you go to those meetings. Don't you write down everything that happens while you're at work?
Well, they like to ask follow-up questions like, "Why did it take you nine minutes to respond to that call?" Or, "Why'd you stay at the scene so long?" Or, "Why have you still not filled those empty slots in your company roster?" HARRY: Sounds like your bosses get you all dressed up to meet up with you so they can tell you that you suck.
Pretty much.
You do those, too, Mom?
No. For which I am grateful because I have seen grown men throwing up in trash cans after coming out of some of those CompStat meetings.
Personnel files?
BOBBY: Yeah.
Candidates to fill Chimney and Eddie's slots. Turns out I've put it off for as long as I can.
Well, you know the rules.
No homework at the table.
Well, I have to change anyways, so I'll just put them in the bedroom and read them later.
Well, so much for a relaxing bedtime.
(chuckles) MAY: Hey, Bobby.
Sorry I'm late.
You're not late.
We're gonna sit down as soon as I change.
Oh, great.
I want to hear all about work over dinner.
You mean you want to know how Eddie's doing.
Well, how is he?

Well...

You do not want to meet a hangry Taylor.
(chuckles) But this is, this is, this is really good. Uh...
Carla, you can come on out.
I know you made dinner. Come on.
Where are you?
EDDIE: All this time, everybody thought I was bad cook.
You were.
Ah.
But now that I'm on a regular schedule, I've had a lot more time to practice.
Well, practice definitely makes perfect.
I'm impressed.
Me, too.

I-I remember what it was like when I was Fire Marshal Buck.
This isn't the same thing. I like what I'm doing.
Yeah, but it-it's not what you're supposed to be doing.
Y-You're a firefighter.
I'm still a firefighter.
Well, yeah, but...
Buck, you need to move on. I have.
(indistinct announcement over P.A.) Huh...
You're back.
Cap asked me to fill in again.
I think I'm more of a "Tuesday," don't you?
And, wh...wh-what are you doing?
Uh, making room for things we need.
You're overstocked on four-by-fours.
(scoffs) Right.
After 13 years in the same firehouse, why would I know what supplies we need?
I'm just doing what Cap asked me.
You keep calling him Cap.
Why? What do you call him?
Do you have daily nicknames for him, too?
Is it what he makes for lunch? Today he's gazpacho?
He's not your cap.
You're just a temp. So don't get comfortable.
New guy's back.
Yes. I do remember typing his name into today's roster.
Well, I-I didn't agree to that.
And yet it happened anyway.
That's what I'm here to talk about.
Hey, Cap, can I talk to you?
HEN: Can it wait, Buck?
Is your name Cap?
I was here first.
W...
Did you know Eddie's not coming back to the 118?
I suspected as much when he asked for a transfer.
I know, but i-it was supposed to be temporary, like Chimney, you know?
Th-They're supposed to come back.
They are coming back.
I don't know.
I-I had dinner with Eddie last night, and-and he seemed...
He seemed what?
Different.
<i> ERICA:</i> <i> No, it's not okay.</i> <i> Every time we go there,</i> <i> it's like</i> me versus your family.
Come on, you are my family.
ERICA: Would it hurt you to remind your mother of that every time?
I mean, I'm just sitting there like an outsider.
She uses me as her personal punching bag.
Okay, maybe she prods, but she doesn't punch.
She loves you.
She just...

Yeah, we-we've seen that movie before, like, almost 30 years ago.
<i> Which would be long before</i> <i> Trenton and Troy were born.</i> <i> That's right.</i> <i> I'm watching you.</i> Okay, I'm hanging up now and calling the police.
<i> Before you do,</i> <i> take a look in your armrest.</i> <i> You work in computers, Sasha.</i> <i> You must recognize</i> <i> a smartphone circuit board.</i> <i> Its sensors can tell</i> <i> what speed you're going.</i> <i> Drop below 55,</i> <i> the bomb...</i> <i> explodes.</i> Okay. Why do you think that?
SASHA: A guy just called, he said if we slow under 55, that we're gonna explode.
Sir, I've seen that movie.
It's a crime to make a false 911 call.
<i> SASHA:</i> <i> No, it's not a fake call.</i> Okay? Please don't hang up.
<i> He told us to look</i> <i> in the armrest.</i> <i> There's all kinds</i> <i> of circuitry in there.</i> He-he knew things about us, where we live.
Look, I don't know if this is <i>a prank or not, but I don't want</i> my wife and kids to die finding out.
Okay. I believe you.
Where are you driving right now?
W-We're headed west on the 210.
We just passed Sunland. <i> Okay, just keep calm,</i> and keep driving safely. CHP is gonna perform a traffic break to clear the road, and I'm sending help to you now.
<i> ATHENA:</i> <i> Dispatch, 727-L-30.</i> <i> Approaching the vehicle now.</i> What's happening?
It's okay.
They're just gonna help us get off.
Why can't we just stop?
SASHA: It's okay, guys.
We just have to listen to them.
Okay? We're gonna be fine.
ERICA: Dad and I are right here, okay?
JIM: All right, I'm deploying the drone to check for devices.
Homemade device.
Could be packed with a nitrate, or a chloride compound. Any one of those <i> would take out the truck</i> <i> and then some.</i> What do you see? Is something down there?
<i> What is it? Is it real?</i> Okay, hold on. I'm connecting the police to this call now.
(radio beeps) We do see something.
<i> It's cause for concern.</i> <i> SASHA: So-so now what?</i> Do you defuse it?
We can't do anything <i> while you're moving.</i> What do we do, then?
<i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Step one, we're gonna</i> <i> ride alongside that pickup</i> <i> truck and match its speed.</i> We have to move fast, so the 147 is here to assist.

<i> NEWSWOMAN:</i> <i> ...reports</i> <i> of an explosive device</i> <i> inside the vehicle,</i> <i> rigged to go off should it</i> <i> reduce speed.</i> <i> Now, we're watching live</i> <i> as two children</i> <i> are being pulled to safety.</i> Linda, tell them not to take the driver out of the truck.
Why not?
Give me your earpiece.
Put me through to the rescue team.
Guys. Guys, it's Eddie.
<i> Do not move the driver.</i> <i> A bomb like that</i> <i> is a sophisticated device.</i> There could be a pressure switch somewhere that senses the driver's movements.

<i> We keep you moving,</i> <i> load two of my guys,</i> <i> and we defuse it in motion.</i> We're switching seats.
What?!
I put my foot on the gas first. You slide underneath me.
I stay, you go.
No. Have you lost your mind?
Sasha, I've run all the versions.
You live, I go.
The boys have their dad, okay?
We both die, your parents take them.
Your mother may be horrible to me, but she adores those children.
The version I can't live with is you gone and me hearing your mother teaching them to hate me because I let you die.
<i> ATHENA:</i> <i> Ma'am,</i> it may not be my place, but we're a little short on time here.
You don't know her.
I think I have a pretty good idea. <i> ERICA: You have</i> a horrible mother-in-law too?

Dad's coming your way.
<i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Then who's driving the truck?</i> BUCK: Hey, Donato, come on!
Okay, I'm gonna stick this around your waist, okay?
Just keep yourself nice and low.
(Erica whimpering) BUCK: Okay, Ravi, last one!
Okay, okay. Ready?
Yeah.
All right.
<i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Dad's on the move.</i> BUCK: Donato, let's go!
(grunts) Come on, Buckley!
LUCY: I got you. I got you.
<i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Vehicle evacuated.</i> <i> All units fall back.</i> So the bomb was fake?
Nope.
Hey, Eddie.
Headed out? Big plans tonight?
Josh. Hi. Uh, nothing big.
Just having drinks with a few friends.
That sounds fun. Unlike earlier, with the bomb in the truck.
That was a pretty wild situation.
It sure was.
Great catch on the secondary trigger.
Thanks.
You know, you could've come to me with your concerns.
It felt like time was of the essence.
Around here time is always of the essence.
But you are an LAFD liaison, not a dispatcher.
You are a guest in this house. Act like it.

BOBBY: It's Wisconsin that's cheesy, Buck.
In Minnesota, we care about the official state grain of wild rice.
Well.
There's an official state grain?
Yeah. LUCY: Wait, so you were a firefighter up there? Oh, wow.
Yeah.
I thank God I'm an L.A. native.

What do you have to be nervous about?
The 118, working with you.
This is the assignment everybody wants.
I'm worried I'm not gonna keep up.
You're fine.
You're a very good paramedic.
But?
But it's not about you.
Because you don't want anyone else in that chair.
You want your partner back.
Listen, Chimney and I -- we...
When we were working together, it didn't feel like work.
Just felt like I was out there with my best friend.
And you can't replace that.
And I wouldn't try.
But I am willing to put in the time, to earn your trust and your respect, if you decide to let me.
ATHENA: Reading personnel files.
Drinks with the team went that well?
It just made me realize I can't keep putting off finding someone, or two someones.
Pretty healthy stack you got here.
I mean, shouldn't be a shortage of qualified people.
Qualifications aren't the problem.
It's chemistry.
(laughs) A good team has a certain rhythm.
Everything falls into place.
Put the wrong person in there and everything falls apart.
Ah, which is why I ride solo.
Because there's too many variables to contend with on a team.
Right now, I feel more like a matchmaker than a fire captain.
Three months of blind dates, still no match.
At least, not one that Buck or Hen approve of.
They're just not ready to move on.
Are you? I mean, maybe all this pressure that you're putting on yourself to find the exact right person is just your way of not making a decision.
Because deep down inside, you're not ready to move on, either.
(sighs) What the 118 had when that team first came together was magic.
Best team I ever worked with, maybe ever will.
How do you replace that?
You know, the 118 wasn't exactly a dream team when you first got there.
More like an island of misfit toys, huh?
Ah, there were one or two bad apples in there.
(laughs) That you tossed aside.
You didn't find a magical, special team.
You built it.
And I know that you can do it again.
So, uh, you're an L.A. native, huh?
Feel like that's kind of rare.
Oh, I am very rare.
The one firefighter in a family full of cops.
Wow. Doesn't that sound like a fun family.
(laughing): Yeah.
Well...
like to keep 'em on their toes.
And, uh, wha-what keeps you on...
on your toes?
The usual.
Jumping onto speeding vehicles on the freeway, leaping off right before they blow up.

Hmm.
No?
All right then, Doctor, what's your diagnosis?
You miss being a firefighter.
You're right.
I guess I do.
So why'd you stop?
I thought you wanted me to stop.
I never said that.
You said it was scary for you, Chris.
It is, sometimes.
But you are really brave, and I can be brave, too.
You don't belong here!
I lived here first! I didn't ask you to show up.
WILLIAMS: Let's just...Everyone, just calm down. Sir. I...
MAN 2: Calm down? You don't have to live here. You don't have to see this every day.
Sergeant Grant!
What's the disturbance?
He is. Look at all this crap.
It's not...
He won't clean it up.
It's not crap. It's my property.
Every morning I look out my window, and this is my view.
It's unsanitary and it's unsightly.
Those words are subjective, right?
(laughs) Oh.
Huh. That family just listed way below comps to get away from this creep's junkyard.
That's not subjective. He's hurting my wallet.
So far, what I'm hearing is a complaint to the city, not a reason to call 911.
They didn't call. I did. Okay, these people are trespassing.
They've been stealing my property.
They are harassing me.
Your property?
You fished half this junk out of our trash!
No! Oh! (gasps) It's only junk if it's not useful, which all of this is.
Okay, do you have any idea how hard it is to find diodes like these?
Oh, I'll put 'em somewhere you'll be able to find 'em!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

Get back.

Oh, is that a threat? He threatened me. That's right.
All right, we...
You heard him.
He threatened me.
We have plenty of room in the back of that car for the both of you.
I...
Williams, start taking statements.
I'll be right back.
What? No. Where are you...?
Where's she going?
WILLIAMS: She'll be back.
Just stay right there.
Sergeant Grant.
I heard you're moving in a hurry.
Is that because of the car bomber?
That man knew where we lived. He's still out there.
We'll just feel safer someplace else.
Even if it is at my mother-in-law's.
Oh. On her invitation?
I took your advice.
All I needed to do was just reach out and ask her for help, and...now she loves me.
You're here for Trashcan Kurt?
Well, he doesn't seems to be too well-liked around these parts.
We have tried. We've even offered to clean up, but he just refuses.
My husband even filed for a court order to force him to clean up.
ATHENA: Oh, yeah? How'd that go?
We didn't even make it to court. I just...
With everything that's gone on, it's...
It just didn't feel important anymore.
So you dropped the court order?
The man who called you about the bomb -- you said he knew things about you.
Yeah. He said he knew our kids' names, what my husband did for a living.
It was like he was watching us the whole time.
Like he was right outside your house, looking in?
ERICA: That's what he said -- "I'm watching you." Go inside and lock all the doors, now.
This is 727-L-30 requesting immediate backup at 573 Dunham Lane.
Possible bombing suspect. Pursuing him into his home.
You two! Get inside. Williams, go around back, keep an eye out for trip wires.
Who knows what he's got cooked up in there.
Everyone, back in your homes!
Sir!
This is the LAPD. If you do not open this door, we are coming in.
(sighs) (gasps) (rat squeaking) (grunts) (grunts) Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.
We need a RA unit. He may have sustained minor injuries.
Bomber suspect is in custody.
<i> (doorbell rings)</i> Eddie.
Hey, Bobby.
Sorry for showing up out of the blue.
I wanted to talk to you before you started your shift.
Always happy to see you. Come on in.
All right. What did you want to talk about?
My request to transfer back to the 118.
Okay, what's going on?
Nothing. I realized I made a mistake, and I want to fix that.
I'm ready to come home.
We talked about this before you left.
(laughs) I know, I know.
You tried to talk me out of it. Uh, you were right.
It isn't about being right, Eddie.
I just want to understand what's changed.
It wasn't three months ago you asked to transfer out, now you want back in.
Christopher was struggling.
He wasn't the only one.
You said that.
I agreed to a transfer, we found you a spot at dispatch, but you don't seem better.
Are you sleeping at all?
(sighs) It's been a rough few months.
I don't think I...gelled there, yeah.
I remember when I first went on medical leave.
It was like all the noise outside stopped, but the noise inside my head got louder.
I think, sometimes, the life we lead, the hours we keep, our focus on other's well-being -- we wind up ignoring our own.
That's not what's happening here.
I...I'll be fine.
Once I'm back on the job.
I think that might need to wait a little while.
You're saying no?
Is this punishment for leaving?
No.
This is concern. I'm not saying never.
But for your sake and the sake of the team, I can't have you back the way you are right now.
You need to go talk to someone, work out whatever's going on.
I don't need a mental health check.
Just need my job back.
You've known me long enough to know those things go hand in hand.
I can go to another house.
Well, you better hope they don't call me for a recommendation.
(sighs) You know, when the brass was coming for you, when they were trying to fire you, I had your back.
I supported you, and now you're trying to turn on me?
Eddie, that's not what's going on here.
I'm looking out for you.
You're gonna stand there with a hundred-something bodies on you and tell me I'm not fit for duty?
Go to hell, Bobby.
(door opens) (door closes) (Taylor humming) Uh, hey.
Hey.
Can we talk?
Okay. Yeah.
Just, um, give me one minute.
It's, uh, it's-it's important.
Okay.
Everything all right?
You look like you're about to throw up.
Oh.
Uh, um...
th-things have-have been great with us.
Or real-really great.
Uh, this is easily the most functional relationship I-I've ever been in.
Well, careful with the sweet talk.
It might go to my head.
I-I just...I-I want to say that I-I love you.
And-and I do, and I-I would never intentionally do anything to hurt you.
Spit it out, Buckley.
Uh...
I-I think-I think you should move in with me.
(laughs) <i> HEN: You did</i> what?!
I know, okay? I-I...I panicked.
I was gonna tell her, but she looked so...pre-hurt.
I had to say something else.
And what did she say?
Well, she was surprised, and, uh...
and then, she-she said yes.
And now the two of you are living together?
Well, not for a few weeks.
Uh, she-she's got to pack and get out of her lease.
Are you familiar with the term "out of the frying pan and into the fire"?
Come on. It's-it's gonna be fine, all right?
Taylor and I already spend all our time together.
What's the difference?
Buck, a relationship changes when suddenly neither of you has your own place to run to, especially when there's something you're running from.
I'm not running from anything, okay?
I...I love Taylor.
And Lucy?
I don't ever have to see her again.
Everybody upstairs. Rundown in five.
I've got some announcements to make.
RAVI: Hey, what was the deal with Eddie at the bar the other night?
He was there? I didn't see him.
I texted him. I just...I thought he was a no-show.
Well, I saw him in the parking lot, and he just kind of blew me off.
Weird.
Yeah.
Wonder what's going on.
Why do I get the feeling that man is one of the announcements?
BOBBY: Morning, everyone. As you all know, we've been two people light these last few months.
We've had some great people fill in, but I think it's time to stop the revolving door.
You all know Jonah. He's been with us for a few shifts. He's done an excellent job.
And he'll be our new paramedic.
(quietly): Damn it.
JONAH: Thanks, Captain.
I'm really happy to be here and be a part of the team.
Doesn't seem so bad.
He'll probably be a good partner.
What are you doing right now?
BUCK: I-I'm looking on the bright side, trying to be a better Buck.
Well, stop it.

But how are you doing?
Shaky.
I just feel like the adrenaline's wearing off.
Then you should get her home.

Maddie, what did you do to him?
<i> Where did you get that?</i> You should have left it where it was.
Do you think this was my fault?
No, it was my fault.

Have you had suicidal thoughts in your past?
Sometimes.
DR. THOMPSON: How long ago?
I was in an abusive marriage.
I had thoughts then, but not like this.
What about before that? Growing up, did you have any feelings of depression?
Suicidal ideations?
Depression? Yeah.
Off and on. It started when I was a kid.
DR. THOMPSON: At what age?
I don't know, like, nine, ten.
You were very young.
My brother died. He was sick.
I'm sorry for your loss.
That must've been hard at such a young age.
Is there a history of depression in your family?
My mom. She, uh...talked a lot about wanting to die after losing my brother.
Do you engage in any form of self-harm?
No.
But three days ago, I tried to drown myself in the ocean.

So, I-I'm just...cured?
Well, now that we have identified the underlying condition, we can get you started on some hormone therapy.
Maddie, you all right?
Yeah, I'm...relieved.
Since having her, I didn't know what was wrong with me, so...
I guess now there is an answer. (chuckles) Yeah.
Okay.
(chuckles) <i> MADDIE:</i> <i> You're transferring me?</i> You're responding well to the treatment.
I think it's time to move you to the outpatient program at the women's center.
This is good news, Maddie.
You get to go home.
Yeah.
Great.
So now what?
Let's take a walk.
Okay.
<i> MADDIE:</i> <i> So, are you from Boston?</i> Yeah, born and raised in Roxbury. You?
Pennsylvania. Now, California.
What brought you here? Plenty of good hospitals in California.
I trained at this hospital.
I used to be a nurse.
So, why'd you quit?
Just got to be too much.
I get that.
Some of these patients will make you question your career path.
(chuckles) Present company excluded.
Ah, thank you.
But I still think the good outweighs the bad.
Helping people, being able to watch them heal and get better.
I'm talking about you, by the way.
You really think that I'm getting better?
I am no doctor, but I've been where you are, and I think you're getting stronger.
You're stronger than you think you are, Maddie.
LANDLORD: We do a lot of short-term.
Visiting nurses needing a place to crash.
It's not fancy, but...
It's fine.
I'll take it.
Great.
I just need you to fill out some paperwork.
Uh, what if I just pay in advance? Six months.
Are you part of the program over at the hospital?
Yeah.
<i> WENDY:</i> <i> I know he means well,</i> <i> but I'm so tired of him</i> <i> trying to help.</i> I can't just turn that frown upside down, Jim.
Maybe you can bring Jim to our next friends and family session.
Okay.
Well, that's it for today.
Thank you all. I'll see you on Thursday.
So, where are they all rushing off to?
Oh, uh, school pickup, daycare, the usual.
Not you?
My daughter's with her dad.
Can't see her right now.
Me either. (chuckles) Oh, no, no.
There's better coffee down the street.
Um...Do you want to go grab some?

I have nowhere else to go.

I still have so much that I have to work through.
I'm just not ready to face all that.
Maddie, are...
are you afraid of your ex? Is he...
God, no. No, he would never...
But I do think he probably hates me.
Why would he hate you?
I almost killed our daughter.
I was giving her a bath. I guess I...
nodded off. She slipped under the water and...
Oh, God.
What kind of mom does that?
Um...
The-the week before I met you, I was finishing up a 28-day court-mandated rehab program.
I got a DUI.
Um...
My-my-my son was in the backseat.
I-I swear, I swear I never meant to put him in any danger.
I...
I was just so overwhelmed and...
You were self-medicating.
That doesn't make you a bad person.
It's the only way I know how to deal when things get hard.
Now, my-my ex won't let me see my son.
I have to prove...(chuckles) that I am not a danger anymore.
I miss him so much.
Maddie, please stay. Please.
I...(sighs) I think you're probably the only friend I have right now.
No one else, no one else knows what this is like.
I just want to get better for her.
I know, I know, and we...
we can help each other. Okay?
Get better together.
Okay.
Then we both go home.
Yeah.
Okay.

I'm confused. Why are they serving beer at a prayer breakfast?
Eggs and kegs.
St. Patrick's Day tradition.
If you say so.
What happened here?
Uh, he went down while we were playing.
Before that, he said he was having trouble breathing.
Randall, let's get him on some oxygen.
BP is extremely elevated, 160/95.
Heart rate is rapid and irregular.
Legs and ankles also appear to be swollen.
Oh. Pitting edema.
Could be possible right-sided heart failure.
Does your friend have a history of heart trouble?
No, not that I know of.
What about diabetes?
JOE: No.
He's not the healthiest guy, but I never heard him mention anything about diabetes.
Um, he has had a cough for a while.
Cough.
Getting a crackling sound.
Sounds like serious lung damage. Is he a smoker?
Not Murray. He never touched them.
Maybe pulmonary fibrosis, but what would cause him to go down now?
Are you for real asking me?
Because our volunteer training didn't go that in depth.
You're like, smart.
You're volunteers? I called the paramedics.
And we arrived first 'cause our tent is across the street.
Medical Volunteer Corps.
Okay.
Looks like he's coming around.
Welcome back, Murray. Let's figure out what's going on with your lungs.
Bagpipe lung.
That can't be a real thing.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, if you're looking for the medical term.
Happens to people who play wind instruments, and also bagpipes.
W-What are you doing? You're gonna ruin his bagpipes.
Yeah. Pretty sure they're already ruined.
I'm gonna need a biohazard bag. These are full of mold.
You've been inhaling this for God knows how long.
It's wreaked havoc on your lungs.
When was the last time you cleaned those things?
Never.
That'll do it.
You're lucky. If you kept going, these bagpipes would've killed you.
They're gonna do X-rays and bloodwork at the hospital, probably put you on corticosteroids to reverse the damage.
(applause) (Chimney exhales) Bagpipe lung.
First time I've seen that.
Buckle up, my friend.
You're about to have a lot of firsts today.
What do you mean you're a volunteer?
Boston Medical Volunteer Corps.
It's mostly handing out Band-Aids and <i> bottles of water</i> <i> to drunk people.</i> There have been a few doozies, though.
You ever hear of bagpipe lung?
Well, it sounds like you're really settling in to life in Boston.

<i>Well, you still have a full-time</i> <i> job waiting for you here.</i> <i> Chim?</i> People are starting to ask questions.
<i> My answer is still</i> <i> the same, Bobby.</i> I'm not coming home without Maddie.

Have a great afternoon. I'll see you next time.

I'm really not in the mood for a lecture.
Okay, that's fine.
I just wanted to check on you 'cause you don't seem like yourself.
Mm. Maybe it's the depression.
Maybe it's the whiskey. (sniffs) You're drunk.
What do you care? (laughs) You're leaving.
My only support system's just hightailing it out of here.
I came here to get well and to go home to my family.
That was the plan, for both of us.
(scoffs) I've messed up too badly. (chuckles, sniffles) I don't deserve to be a mom.
Okay, you know what? I told myself exactly that same thing six months ago, and I was wrong.

You can, too.
Not by this afternoon.
Ugh.

No, no, no. You can't, you can't show up like this.
I can't not show up.
Okay, what time is the appointment?
Um...3:00.

What are you doing? No, no, no, no.
I-I-I cannot be admitted. No. If my ex finds out, I won't be able to see my son. I'm sorry...
Okay, I'm not admitting you.
I'm not admitting you. I'm helping you.
(sighs) Sit right here.
I'm gonna get you a banana bag. It'll sober you up.
I'll be right back.
Maddie?
Why is your face on the bulletin board?
What?
That's you.
Oh, my God, he's still looking for me.
I thought you said he hated you.
You lied.
I didn't lie.
All this time, I thought that we were in the same boat.
Being punished by our exes.
Not being able to-to see our kids.
But you could've gone back any time, right?
I'm fighting like hell to see my son, and you left them.
I had to.
Okay? It was dangerous for her and for me, and I...
I needed to get help and to get better.
Congratulations, Maddie.
You're better.
You don't need me anymore.

Excuse me. Sorry.
Sorry.

No, I meant your hand, and statistically speaking, people don't die from snake bites.
Stupidity, that's another story.
RANDALL: So, that's it?
What about a tourniquet? Or maybe we can cut it and suck out the poison?
That is exactly what you're not supposed to do.
Antivenom is his best bet.
Oh, it stings!

That's not a bad idea.
We should ask for that.

Um, just, please, call me, okay? I...
Just want to make sure you're all right.
Thank you.
MADDIE: Sir, I'm looking for a woman.
She's late 30s. Blonde.
About this tall and probably drunk.
Oh, a drunk woman.
That narrows it down.
You know it's St. Patrick's Day, right?
Lean forward a bit for me. There you go.
If you could hold that, please.
Nothing's broken.
Looks like he's all yours.
OFFICER: Thanks. Let's go.

Uh, technically it's a shillelagh.

(laughs) Hey, Kira, call me.
I'm really worried about you.
Hey, I'm gonna go grab a lobster roll from the food truck.
You want anything?
Sure.
Just make sure there's no mayo on it.
I sense you have no idea what a lobster roll is.
Just grab him one anyway.
Three lobster rolls coming up.
So how is it? Being of service again.
Honestly, it's the best I've felt in probably a year.

We were axe throwing, and he stumbled in front of me, and I-I hit him instead of the target.
No pulse. He's not breathing.
I'd say start compressions, but...
There's an axe in his head?
Randall, that sandwich board, bring it over here!
ELI: Okay. Okay, let's get him into a seated position.
CHIMNEY: I got his head.
What do I do?
Randall, put the board behind him.
Eli will hold him up while I do compressions.
What do I do?
Okay, hold his head, keep his airway clear.
I can do that without looking at his head, right?
Howie, on your count.
Feels like old times, doesn't it?
Well, nobody's puked on me yet.
(Randall gags) Oh, God.
That is not an invitation, Randall.
Pulse check.
Pulse is back. We got him.
Dispatch, this is Paramedic Cobb.

Okay, let's secure it and move him.

You can take up chess.

What if another call comes in?
I'll let you use the lights and sirens.

We think she might be aspirating.
Wake up.
Good. Good! There's a unit just down the block.
Good. Wave 'em down.
Okay.
Kira, come on, wake up, wake up, wake up.
Come on, Kira, wake up!
Over here!
Come on.
MAN: Hey!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.
Kira, wake up.
Over here.
(siren wailing) MAN: She's here. Come on!
MADDIE: Oh, my God, hurry.
MAN: Over here. Over here. She's right here.
Come on. She's right here.
Excuse me. Excuse me. What do we got?
She's 38 years old. Alcohol poisoning.
She's aspirated vomit. She's unresponsive.
ELI: How long has she been out?
MADDIE: I don't know.
I did a sternal rub but she's not coming to.
Is she on anything?
Prescriptions for antidepressants.
Any other drugs? Illegal substances?
I don't know.
CHIMNEY: Pardon me. Make a hole! Coming through.
Maddie?
Howie.
We have acute alcohol intoxication, heart rate severely low.
BP 80/60 and she's cold to the touch.
Let's start suction and get her on a gurney.
Copy that.
You okay?
Y-Yeah. Is Jee with you?
She's fine.
She's staying with a friend while I play paramedic again.
All right, suction's ready.
38-year-old female with acute alcohol poisoning, unresponsive on the scene after aspirating vomit.
Administered fluid and bolused one liter of LR.
Used mechanical suction to clear airway.
Vitals are stable.
(sighs) I think she'll be okay.
It's a good thing you found her in time.
I'm, uh, I'm Eli, by the way.
We were never formally introduced.
Maddie. I've heard a lot about you.
Same.
You and that little girl are about all he talks about these days.
Where is he?
Uh, probably outside.
I think he needed a minute.
Me, too.
(sighs) How is he...really?
I mean, I know that I could ask him myself.
But he'd probably sugarcoat it for you?
When he showed up, he was a mess.
He was worried about you.
He was worried about Jee-Yun, and he was racked with guilt.
Guilt? I'm the one that left.
Yeah, but he's the one that feels responsible.
Eli said you would be here.
He was right.
He usually is.
It's one of his more annoying traits.
But actually, this time he was wrong.
You see, all those days that I spent sitting right here on this bench convinced you would walk out those doors, he said I was crazy.
And here you are.
I know that you must have a lot of questions.
I know why you left, Maddie.
Still not sure why you stayed away.
Because I didn't think I'd ever get better.
And it didn't feel safe to be around any of you.
What happened with Jee-Yun and the bathtub, that was an accident.
But trying to kill myself wasn't.
You what?
When I dropped her off at the firehouse I thought that's it, she's safe.
So I drove up the coast, I found a beach, and I walked into the ocean.
My head was so full of all the mistakes I had made in my life, and I just thought everybody would be better off without me.
Sad at first, yeah.
But that would fade.
And Jee, she's so young, she wouldn't even remember me as her mommy.
How could you even think that?
Maddie, if you died, I would never...
Never forgive yourself.
I got out of the ocean for you.
For both of you.
But I had to stay here to learn to stop running.
Maddie...
I would have done anything to help you.
I beat myself up every day that I didn't do more.
I'm so sorry for everything that I put you through.
I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you.
You were there.
Not enough.
I blame myself for you leaving, for missing the warning signs.
Or maybe ignoring them.
I just wanted so badly for you to be okay, I just...
I pretended that you were okay.
I think I did, too, for a while.
(both sniffling) (Chimney exhales sharply) I guess we both spent too much time hiding from the truth, and I don't want to do that anymore.
Me either.
No more pretending.
From now on, let's just be honest about how we feel, and what we want.
Okay.
What do you want?
She should be awake from her nap soon.
(coos) There she is.
Look who's here, Jee-Yun. It's Mommy.
She's so big.
I swear to God, I've been feeding her normal portions.
You probably want to hold her.
Uh, she never liked strangers.
Maddie, you're not a stranger.
I think I am.
Maddie...
She's grown up so much. I missed it.
I missed all of it.
(sobbing) (Jee-Yun crying) So you figure out what's next?
I mean, back to L. A., or should I be getting you a job application?
I don't know.
It didn't feel right asking her about the future when she was so clearly mourning the past.
Not the glorious reunion you'd been dreaming of, huh?
I never really thought that far.
I mean, I imagined finding her a million times, you know?
I'd see her, she'd see me.
Movie always ended right there.
They live happily ever after.
(scoffs) Yeah.
Kind of wishing the end credit sequence was less of a bummer.
You know, I was really mad at her for not being there.
But tonight was the first time I realize what leaving actually cost her.
You know, after we had our girls, Molly wanted to stay home with them, so I went back to work.
And every time I left, I always said the same thing: "I love you. I'll call you later.
Don't let 'em do anything cool while I'm gone." (laughs)
Maybe if I'd just found her earlier.
You did everything you could, Howie.
All right, no matter what else you're feeling, know that.
I just wanted to fix her, you know?
Just make it all okay.
Even though you know fixing her isn't your responsibility?
Yeah.
Why do I always do that?
It's how you're wired.
Helping people is how you help yourself.
And because you love her.
(chuckles) (sighs) I knew I had missed a lot, and it's been six months, but seeing her...
Made it real?
Too real.
I just wasn't prepared for how much it was gonna hurt.
I mean, looking at her, I saw every milestone I've missed.
But that doesn't mean that you can't be there for...
all the other ones.
What about you?
Did you talk to your social worker?
(sighs) Yeah. (clears throat) Um, I have to go back to detox, then...
another 60 days outpatient.
And are you gonna do it?
If I want to see my son.
Yeah. I have to.
Thank you for saving my life.
I don't remember everything I said, but, um, I know how I can get.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
You were hurting.
We're not always our best selves when that happens.
I'm really glad you're okay.
Well, not yet.
But I'm gonna keep trying.
I have to. (laughs) Not just for me, but for Robbie.
Was I gone too long?
I can't get back the time I lost.
No.
But you can move forward.
And the only way to do that is to forgive yourself.
And, Maddie, don't be afraid...
to fight for what you want.
<i> (knocking, door opens)</i> Hey.
Hey.
Aww, how's my girl today?
(Jee-Yun fussing, crying) (Chimney sighs) I promise it's not you.
We walked by a park on the way here, and she got very angry when I said it wasn't playtime.
Oh, that's okay, we can go to a park. That's fine.
Uh, I think we should wait at least an hour.
I don't want to make it look like I caved in to a tantrum, you know.
Right. Oh, right, she's old enough to have those now.
Oh...come on, Jee-Yun.
Don't you want to say hi?
(fussing, crying continues) Come on, Jee-Yun.
Don't you want to say hi to Mommy? Hmm?
(Jee-Yun crying harder) I'm not gonna lie, this might be worse than going through colic all over again.
Can I try something?
Be my guest, but don't be offended if it doesn't work.

And-and Jee?
(both laughing) HEN: Welcome home.
I have missed you.
Missed you, too. You want a beer?
Yeah.
(door closes) Maddie not around?
We broke up.
So, we realized somewhere around St. Louis that it was over.
After everything you've been through?
CHIMNEY: All those other times we were apart, it always felt like it was outside forces.
Ex-husbands, pandemics.
This time, it feels like the call's coming from inside the house.
It's hard enough trying to keep a relationship together under the same roof.
But not speaking to each other for six months?
We grew apart.
Or we grew while we were apart, I guess.
It kind of sounds like he's punishing you for being sick.
No, that's not what's going on.
We made a mutual decision together that this is what's best for Jee.
So no one is punishing anyone.
Okay? Don't be mad at Chim.
(sighs) I mean, I do still owe him a punch in the face.
I already apologized to Buck. Everything is fine with us.
I'm ready to get back with the team.
Mm, yeah.
The team's configuration is just a little bit different than when you left.
Eddie quit?
Bobby replaced me?
You asked Taylor to move in with you?
Buck made out with the new firefighter?
(sighs) Wow.
Yep.
(exhales) You guys totally fell apart without me.
HORATIO: This is a very strongly worded release form.
VERN: Yeah, well, sharks don't mess around.
So neither do we.
Uh, uh, this section here about being "permanently maimed or physically disfigured"?

Well, is there anything safer than the cage?

Help them tie off so we can board.
Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
How deep was he before he came up?
Over 100 feet. My other diver's still coming up.
He's only halfway.
Might as well just grab him now.
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?
JONAH: Pulse is weak.
Severe barotrauma.
Every blood vessel in his eye must have burst.
The mask did that. Squeezed his head like a melon.
I worked at a dive shop in Redondo.
HEN: Oh.
Ruptured eardrums.
Shouldn't be surprised.
Airway is patent, but breathing's extremely shallow.
One of his lungs is probably gone.
Would've ruptured on the way up.
(gasps) HORATIO: Can't move.
Everything hurts.
Jonah?
Push fluids and get him on O2.
Okay.
LUCY: Temporary paralysis, too.
He's got it bad, Cap.
Buck, get him prepped for medevac.
This is 118 to Air Operations.
We need medevac at San Pedro Marina.
Victim is suffering from severe decompression sickness and possibly a punctured lung.
Prep for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.
<i> PILOT:</i> <i> Roger that, Captain 118.</i> <i> We're transporting</i> <i> a trauma patient.</i> <i> Will circle back as soon as</i> <i> we unload. 15 minutes out.</i>
He'll be dead before he sees the inside of a chamber.
She's not wrong.
JONAH: So what do we do?
Tag him and go grab a smoothie?
We could put him back in the water.
I could take him down, bring him back up properly.
That's too risky -- we need to get him in a chamber.
15 minutes?
We could build one faster.
Saw a diver do it once in Ensenada.
He said all you need is a good seal and a lot of compressed air.
He built his in a meat freezer.
How about a fresh fish freezer?
Buck, kill the power to the freezer.
He's gonna be in there anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes.
Could be hypothermic in ten, okay, even with the power off.
So we need to pump him full of warm fluids.
JONAH: Great call, Hen.
We could run the I. V. in with the air.
JONAH: I'll stay with him.
Take pressure readings and monitor his vitals.
Radio us if anything goes south.
(drill whirring) BOBBY: Okay.
Buck, Lucy, run 'em wide open.
(gasping) Lucy, be ready to switch out those tanks.
Okay, that's ten minutes.
<i> How are we looking, Jonah?</i> Pressure equivalent of 100 feet below.
Excellent.
<i> JONAH:</i> <i> Still hanging tight.</i> Core temperature is steady and his vitals are improving.
Copy that.
Fresh tanks here...
Firefighter Donato.
Thanks, Firefighter Buckley.
Okay, Lucy, start bringing the pressure down.
Okay.
How is he?
Swelling has reduced, BP is stabilized, normal breathing has returned.
Good.
Never lost anyone on a charter yet, don't want to start now.
Don't know what happened out there to make him freak out like that.
HORATIO: Sharks.
Phobia.
So you booked a shark encounter charter?
Immersion therapy.
I'm not sure it works like that.
They say the only thing to fear is...
Crazy people.
FRANK: So what are you afraid of?
That's a pretty open-ended question, don't you think?
I mean, I don't love going to the dentist.
I doubt the fear of having a cavity filled is why you blew up at Captain Nash the way you did.
I apologized for that.
I was upset.
Shouldn't have said what I said to him.
So why did you?
How's Christopher?
Good.
Good. He had a rough patch over the holidays, but he's doing better now.
Good.
I'm glad to hear that.
I know how much you worry about him.
(chuckles) His well-being.
Is that a bad thing now?
Not at all.
I just wonder if you worry about your own well-being.
You're a man who spends all of his time managing other people's pain.
Army medic, firefighter, father.
But not a lot of time facing your own.
An old drill sergeant of mine used to say that pain is nothing but weakness leaving the body.
You think pain is weakness?
It can be.
If you give in to it.
Can't put all your feelings in a box, Eddie.
You might think if you're strong enough that it'll hold.
But at some point, that box is gonna blow open.
And take me with it.
You and anyone else around you.
So what do I do?
Sit here and...
download you on every bad thing that's happened to me?
Could be a while.
Let's take a shortcut.
Maybe you should talk about your pain with someone who shares it.
Think about that first trauma.
And then talk to someone who can understand exactly what you've been through.
<i> TAYLOR:</i> <i> Oh, okay, well...</i> (chuckles) ...definitely not kitchen.
You know, I didn't realize you had this much stuff.
Yeah, we'll just have to cull as we unpack.
We probably have two of everything.
Including two couches.
Ah...
Uh, maybe just set it down over there for now.
Thanks.
What exactly are we gonna do with two couches?
Well, we'll get rid of one.
I'm guessing not the one they just carried in?
No.
Ah.
So...
Yeah.
Okay, I will see if anyone at the firehouse wants to...buy a couch.
Uh, maybe that new firefighter needs one.
Uh, you-you mean Lucy?
Um, yeah, I-I wouldn't...I wouldn't know.
Uh, we haven't really...interacted.
Uh, she-she's kind of a little...
A little what?
Bold.
"Bold"?
Uh, yeah, she-she-she's bold.
Um, yeah, so-so...
I don't know what her tastes are.
Huh, you know, you can just ask her.
Do you have good taste?
She says yes, you'll know she'll love it.
Good plan.
Aha.
Okay.
I'm gonna go return my keys and do a walkthrough with the landlord.
Wish me luck.
(knocking) (Jee-Yun cooing) MADDIE: Is this a bad time?
<i> CHIMNEY:</i> <i> A familiar face.</i> Finally!
Yeah, welcome back. We missed you.
Of course you did -- so many new firefighters around here, I thought I walked into the wrong house.
Well, on the plus side, I'm no longer the new guy.
They really do grow up so fast, don't they?
HEN: Oh, look who decided to stop by.
And just in time for lunch.
Is it lunchtime?
Can't wait to see what Cap's cooking.
Let's go.
This is...
not cooked.
What, do you want me to warm it up for you in the microwave?
You're saying no to my sushi?
I'm not saying no.
I'm saying, "Why?" Yeah, but for the record, I'm saying yes to whatever he doesn't want, so...
Never mind. I'll cook something for you.
I have got red snapper, flounder.
How do you feel about tilapia?
How does anyone feel about tilapia, Cap?
Yeah.
Okay, so what's up with all the fish?
You guys become pescatarians or something while I was gone?
We had a call at a fish market the other day.
And they paid you in flounder?
BOBBY: Hey.
How about a little seared salmon?
Little ginger, little lemon, little garlic?
What do you say?
Why not?
All right.
I'm glad you're back.
You seem better.
Glad you guys worked it out.
I don't have a job.
I need to find an apartment.
I used most of my savings when I left.
And Chimney used most of his chasing me.
Well, I'm sorry about the whole apartment thing.
If I would've known...
What?
If you had known that I was coming back, you wouldn't have asked your girlfriend to move in with you?
(chuckles) Hi.
(Jee-Yun cooing) Yeah, yeah.
Buck?
Uh, yeah, uh, maybe.
(laughs) Look, basically, I-I did a dumb thing.
And I wasn't sure how to tell Taylor, so instead I...
I did an even dumber thing.
Asking her to move in?
Mm-hmm. And listen, I-I do...
I do love her.
You know, and she's really been there for me with you guys gone, and I-I want to believe I asked her for the right reasons.
But?
I can't help but wonder if...
maybe I was just scared of being left again.
We are a pair.
The fugitive and the settler.
I'm always running, you're always...
Clinging.
(chuckles softly) I really did miss you.
I missed you, too.
Okay, so you said that the second dumb thing you had done was asking Taylor to move in with you.
What was the first?

You're smart.
Crate training's important for reinforcing good behavior.
Right?
So how much playtime are your pets used to?
Well, they get plenty of recreation.
And I used to let them out more often, but the little devils kept running away.
So this is where you'll be sleeping.
This actually used to be the kennel.

Reckless and remorseful.
Wonder what that's about.
(siren wails) (whispers): Oh, God.
Oh, God. Did something happen?
Is Pauline okay?
Pauline Barrett?
My sister. We live together.
I-I'm Leticia.
Sergeant Grant.
So, you don't know where she is?
She's not answering my calls or texts.
W-Was she in some kind of accident?
There was an incident at a gas station.
Oh. That's why she smelled like gasoline.
She blew through here, took a shower, then left again.
She wouldn't talk to me.
She's just not herself lately.
In what way?
(sighs) She's irritable.
Easy to set off.
Last week, we were at a grocery store.
Some guy was ahead of us in the express lane, and he had way more than 15 items.
He probably had 15 bottles of wine alone.
He counts those as one item. I know the creature.
What happened?
Pauline told him to move to another line. He wouldn't.
They started arguing, and Pauline just snapped.
Grabbed the bottles of wine and smashed them at his feet.
And this guy was big. He was getting in her face and leaning over her, and she didn't even blink.
And there haven't been any other changes in her life?
(sighs) Just her voice.
Uh, I noticed it a few weeks ago.
She started to sound raspy and hoarse.
Please, you have to find her.
I don't know what's happening with my sister, but she's not okay.
What is your location, sir?
<i> I'm at the recycling center</i> <i> on Sadler.</i> <i> Holy crap! She's walking</i> <i> right on the ledge.</i> We are aware, sir.
MAY: 911.
What's your emergency?
Got another call about the recycling jumper.
MAY: Same thing over here.
Yes, ma'am. Thanks for calling.
JOSH: 911. What's your emergency?
<i> PAULINE:</i> <i> I'm at the recycling center</i> <i> on Sadler.</i> Yes, we know about the jumper.

BOBBY: Hey.

Negative. Too much obstruction.
We're gonna have to get her down the hard way.
All right, Buck, Ravi, hit it.
<i> JOSH:</i> <i> Pauline,</i> <i> I know you're afraid.</i> PAULINE: But I'm not.
That's the problem.
I'm not afraid at all.
Okay. You're...fearless.
When you say it like that, it sounds like a good thing.
I mean, who'd want to be afraid?
<i> Uh, not many people.</i> Because they don't know what it feels like, <i> how empty you feel inside</i> when the fear is gone.
<i> REPORTER:</i> <i>We are at the recycling plant...</i> (knocking) LINDA: Hey, Eddie.
I need you to tweet about these road closures.
We've got a jumper.
Do they even know who she is?
Remember that lady from the Gas 'N' Sip who almost set herself on fire?
Apparently, she's lost the ability to be afraid.
Is that even a real thing?

Almost there. <i> BOBBY: Copy that.</i> Here you go. Take a look.
HEN: That doesn't look good.
She did douse herself with gasoline.
HEN: Gasoline wouldn't do that.
Not even an allergic reaction.
Any other symptoms?
Mood swings, fits of anger.
I mean, yelling at men twice her size at the grocery store.
Oh, and her voice changed.
Her voice?
Yeah.
Wasn't raspy or hoarse before.
But, you know, maybe that's from all the yelling.
(whispers): Hey.
Cap, we are way too exposed here.
She sees us coming, and she's gonna jump.
HEN: Cap.
Yeah.
I have an idea, but I-I need to get closer.

I don't think you are, Pauline.
Are you sure?
'Cause I'm up here praying and hoping that my stomach would drop or the hairs on the back of my neck would stand up.
But there's nothing.
I feel empty.
<i> If I operate out of fear</i> <i> and it goes away,</i> <i> how am I supposed to operate?</i> <i> HEN:</i> <i> Well, the first thing you do</i> <i> is look at me.</i> <i> Look at me.

It's your brain.
PAULINE: It's the same thing.

No. No, Pauline.

They're running tests now to confirm, see if her intestines are blocked, and if so, how serious it is.
Okay.
Okay, any theories on an underlying cause?
Viral infection. She's too young for appendicitis.
Okay, uh, could be autoimmune, Celiac, Crohn's.
A tumor. I mean, it's a possibility, right?
"None of the above" is also one of the possibilities, okay?
Sometimes kids just get intussusception.
No one knows why. Might be a family history.
Yeah, leukemia. That's in my family history.
<i> (screaming)</i> <i> ERIC: Oh, my God!</i> <i> (excited chatter on video)</i> Any word from Chimney or your sister?
Uh, no. Still just waiting on updates.
Hey, uh, awesome catch.
Mm.
But-- and I say this with some experience here-- maybe don't let it go to your head.
It's not.
(scoffs) She should have died.
Nine times out of ten, I don't catch her.
Or I don't see her in time, I don't move fast enough.
Or I grab her and she slips through, and she takes me with her.
Wait, you're obsessing over things that didn't happen?
I'm trying to figure out how I should have saved her in a way that doesn't involve luck. (sighs) So I'm ready for next time.
My first year here, there was this guy hanging from a roller coaster.
I didn't get to him in time, and he fell.
Yeah, I remember that.
I spent a lot of time running that one back in my mind, you know.
What if I had got to him faster?
What if the truck had been at a better angle?
What if he had just grabbed my damn hand?
You have any epiphanies?
That it didn't matter what brilliant hypothetical scenario I could come up with.
He was still gonna be dead.
That lady... she didn't die, 'cause you caught her.
So accept it was a lucky break and move on?
Look, your luck could change tomorrow, so we take the wins when we can get 'em.
(alarm ringing) <i> MAN (over P. A.): Attention,</i> <i> Station 118...</i> Anyway, luck or not, that was still a great save.
(sighs heavily) Stop what you're doing.
I'm not doing anything.
Just waiting.
Shouldn't we know something by now?
I'm gonna go ask someone.
(exhales sharply) Maddie, this isn't your fault.
We don't know what it is.
Whatever it is, it's not your fault.
Even if it turns out to be the same, exact rare form of leukemia that your brother had, it wouldn't be your fault.
I just keep thinking is it reckless or selfish to have a baby with that family history?
Well, your parents had three kids.
Two of 'em grew up to be perfectly healthy.
One didn't, but that was 30 years ago, and the field of medicine has come a long way since then.
Hell, there wasn't even a bone marrow database back then.
I can't be the reason that she's in danger again.
You're not. You never were.
Last time it was an accident. This time...
we don't even know what it is yet.
Yeah.
I slammed a car door on her hand.
We were somewhere around Toledo, and we had stopped for the night, and I had unbuckled her from her car seat, but I realized she needed a warmer jacket, so I was gonna go to the back to grab one for her.
(sighs) I didn't realize she climbed out of her car seat, and I shut the door, and her hand was there.
Oh, my God.
And she screamed bloody murder, and I thought that I had maimed her for life.
But I didn't.
How long did you beat yourself up for that?
(scoffs) I'll let you know when I stop.
By the time I saw the RPG coming, it was too late.
We got hit, and we went down.
You said Mills was the first one to see it.
Did you both have the same vantage point at the time?
Uh, no. She was in the front. I was sitting behind her.
Did you have a clearer view out the window than Mills did?
Not really. I kind of had my hands full working on Greggs.
Okay, let me see if I understand.
Mills had a better view of the ground down below, and you couldn't really look out the window because you were trying to save an injured man's life.
Not that it mattered. He died anyway.
You regret trying to save him?
What? No.
I only ask because when you talk about the chopper being shot down, you imply that you could have done something to stop it.
From what you've told me, the only way that's possible is if you let Greggs die.
Was that ever an option?
My job was trying to save him. I was doing my job.
So your job wasn't to look for hostiles on the ground?
No.
Then why is it your fault that you didn't see them sooner?
Hey.
Hey. How'd it go?
Usual. Crack myself open for 50 minutes, walk out feeling like I was hit by a bus.
I think that means it's working.
I'm supposed to feel better at some point, right?
Where's Chris?
He's in his room, finishing homework.
Oh.
Chris drew this?
BUCK: That one's mine. I misunderstood the assignment.
Hey, you ever think that maybe it's not worth it?
Not the therapy, the...
What we do for a living that makes us need therapy.
What I put myself through, what I put my kid through.
The greater good and all.
Maybe that's not a thing.
Maybe it's just random.
If that's the case, then what's the point of it all?
<i> TV REPORTER:</i> <i> In case you missed it,</i> <i> stunning footage</i> <i> from the scene of</i> <i> an incredible rescue</i> <i> as a woman falling</i> <i> from a sign...</i> No matter how many times I see it, it still doesn't seem real.
Oh, tell me about it. I was standing right next to her, and I'm still not sure how she did it.
It's enough to make you believe in actual miracles.
(door opens) Maddie.
Buckley-Han?
Yeah, that's us.
Okay. I've got good news and great news.
Well, we like how you're starting.
It was intussusception, which we confirmed with a lower GI series that very helpfully put her intestine back where it belonged.
It happens sometimes.
But that means we don't have to repair it surgically.
Uh, what about the underlying cause?
Anything to worry about there?
Clean bill of health.
Okay, so when can we see her?
They'll be bringing her up soon.
Just want to keep an eye on her for a few hours, see if there's any adverse reaction to the barium.
Then you can take her home.
Thanks. Thanks so much.
Well, Mom should get a thank-you, too.
If we hadn't caught this so early, we might not be so lucky.
It was a good call bringing her in.
Man, we'd be done by now if we hadn't lost that stop sign.
Lost? Try sabotaged.
Nick and Colton probably chickened out and stole our stolen sign from the truck.
Whatever, man. They're gonna need more than just one stop sign to win that scavenger hunt.
It's the police. Hurry up!
(garbled radio transmission) They just never get enough of this foolishness.
(siren chirps) Come on. Let's go, let's go!
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.
We got a two-- Oh, no, no, no!
(tires screeching) (exhales sharply) (groaning) Oh, my God.
I didn't see a stop sign.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God. What can I do?
Go to my patrol car.
Grab my medical kit. It's in a blue tackle box.
Hurry!
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.
I need an RA unit to Dover and Legion Lane.
I have a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.
(Trevor groans) You! You, get over here!
Is he-- Is he gonna die?
I need you to get over yourself and help me.
Take off that jacket and press down on that leg hard.
You want him to live, do it now!
(pained groaning) There you go. Press hard. Press hard.
That's it. That's it.
What's his name?
Tr-Trevor.
Why'd you run?
You would have arrested us.
It was a misdemeanor.
You're gonna die over a misdemeanor?
(Trevor choking) What do we do?
All right, we're gonna push him on his side, he's choking.
We're gonna push on three.
Keep his head, neck and back aligned.
On three.
Okay.
One, two, three.
Keep him steady. Trevor, can you hear me?
(sirens approaching) Come on, come on, come on. Trevor. Trevor!
No. No, no, no, no. I'm not gonna leave. No.

We've got a rhythm. Let's move.
BOBBY: How's he looking?

You're not.

BAILEY: What do we got?
17-year-old male struck by a motor vehicle at a high rate of speed.
Got massive blood loss from a leg wound and some bruising on his abdomen, consistent with internal bleeding.
Okay. Prep the OR for an exploratory laparotomy.
Also give Ortho a heads-up.
We're gonna need to try and save that leg after we save his life.
I know you. Both of you.
Good to see you on your feet this time.
Thanks again.
She's the trauma surgeon.
Talk about your dumb luck.

I have a feeling that Athena's gonna want to know.
He's doing really well.
Apparently he had a really great surgeon.
Oh, would you stop.
What?
HEN: The surgeon.
She was that woman that fell off the balcony.
Wow, what are the chances of that?
That's like a two-for-one special.
BOBBY: It's a pretty busy hospital.
Who knows how many people Lucy actually saved in the long run?
So, do you feel any differently about catching her now?
Doctor or not, that woman got to live.
HEN: You know, it's weird.
I never really thought about it before, but now, I wonder how many other people we've inadvertently saved by saving someone else.
BOBBY: Hey.
Hey.
You're up early.
Oh, are you preparing for another battle royale poker night against the Wilsons?
No, just good old solitaire.
I used to play this after work back in my rookie days.
Helped keep my mind off things I couldn't shake off from the job.
How's that working for you now?
I've been playing all night. Couldn't sleep.
Have you heard about that boy from the accident?
I wasn't sure I wanted to.
You know Harry has those same shoes.
When you arrived on the scene, I saw one of them in the middle of the street because that boy had been knocked out of it when the car hit him.
And all I could think was, "Harry has those shoes." His are probably two sizes smaller, but not for long.
Harry's a good kid.
Yeah, well, even good kids do dumb things.
They do.
That boy is gonna be okay.
He's made it out of surgery.
(exhales sharply) Feel like you can sleep now, or do you want me to make a pot of coffee and you can deal me in?
No. I am done with games of chance.
Hey, good morning.
(sighs) How was your shift?
Uh, yeah, you know, pretty good.
Yeah?
What are you working on?
Lucy Donato.
Uh, what?
I've been trying to get an interview with this woman for days, but she won't return my calls.
I was starting to take it personally, but apparently she's not returning anyone's calls.
Uh, you mean she's not taking reporters' calls, right?
Exactly. So...
I was thinking maybe you could talk to her and put in a good word for me.
No. Absolutely not.
Oh...
Never gonna happen, but-but-but, hey, hey, I will give you an exclusive and pretty heartwarming surprise ending to the story that no one else knows.
Oh, I'm intrigued. What's the catch?
I need you to help me find someone.
(horse snorts) BUCK: Hey, so, uh, so what do you think?
They're really tall.
(Buck laughs) If you don't want to do this or it gets too scary, we can leave.
When do I get to ride one?
Okay, maybe not that scary.
First, I am gonna introduce you to all the horses, and then I'm gonna show you how to groom them and feed them, and then you're gonna walk around on a lead.
That sounds like work.
(Buck chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, it's work.
But it's how the horses learn to trust you, and you learn to trust the horses.
Can I show him around the place?
Sure.
I'll be here if you need me, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Ready?
Let's go meet some horses.
Have fun.
Okay, Dad. Thanks.
(speaking quietly) Equine therapy?
I was doing some research with Taylor, and I found this place.
What kind of research?
Well, you were saying the other day how random everything seems.
Like, is there, is there a point to anything?
I remember.
So before you joined the 118, right, we had this rule.
Don't go past the glass doors.
We bring someone to the ER, we hand them over, and that's it-- our job is done.
Never heard that one.
I'm not sure who the first one to break the rule was.
Probably me.
Yeah.
Our job was always just to save the person in front of us.
Whatever happens next, well, we...
we aren't supposed to know.
I can see the wisdom in that philosophy.
It got me thinking...
about the day you got shot.
Well, with everything that happened, I almost forgot, that wasn't even our call.
We were only there because of...
Charlie.
It made me wonder if you ever wished we hadn't saved him.
What?
Come on.
The kid is being poisoned by his mom.
Probably gonna be messed up for life.
He almost died. You don't regret going there?
No.
But if it's all just random...
It was still the right thing to do.
Yeah.
I think so, too.
That's Charlie.
BUCK: He lives with his aunt and uncle now.
They seem like really good people.
They've been bringing him here for the past few months.
He looks happy.
BUCK: 'Cause he got the help he needed.
And that started with you.
Whatever happens to him next, you gave him that second chance.
Maybe that's the point.
Yeah. (chuckles) Maybe it is.
@@@@@@
<i> SELENE:</i> <i> Hey, everyone,</i> <i> it's your girl Selene.</i> As you guys can see, I am back in La-La Land.
I actually just flew in on the PJ today, because...I just got the keys to my brand-new house!
Ah, it's so amazing. Look at it.
It's like a Barbie dreamhouse, which is literally what I told my realtor.
How do they do their job like that, you know?
Without further ado, let's go inside.
Ah, you guys.
Okay, wait. I see another question.
"Why were you on a Cessna today?
I thought you had a G5?" You guys, I take the big plane when I'm going to, like, Europe.
Today I was flying domestic, so I took the little plane to be more environmental.
Okay, plane police?
(gasps) And this is the kitchen.
No, I won't be doing any cooking in here, but my personal chef has already signed off, and they love their new office.
And then, while the chef is cooking up the gourmet du jour, I will be spending all my time our here.
Ah. Would you look at this view?
Honestly, better than the Observatory because nobody's here begging me for a selfie.
(chuckles) JK. Love you guys.
(construction rattling) Oh, sorry about that.
That's just some construction I'm doing on the garage.
Got to make some room for my new ride.
I'm thinking a blacked-out McLaren.
Let me know what you guys think in the comments.
(construction noise continues) This is the primary.
But the real, real reason why I wanted this house in particular...
Okay, wait for it. Wait for it.
(gasps) My own personal sauna.
Come on in. (chuckles) In Scandinavia, people use saunas all the time.
Like, they use them literally if they want to unwind, or just, like, relax.
I guess they're really stressed there.
Okay, check this out.
I have a cute little ladle.
See you ladle. (chuckles) (gasps) Oh, my God. So fire, y'all.
So cute.
(rumbling) Oh.
Sorry.
I told them to keep it down while I'm working.
I might need to have a little word with the construction guys or whatever.
(rumbling) What the hell?
That's not okay.
Um...
(rumbling) Oh, my...
I'm gonna check on that.
(screams) <i> (over phone):</i> <i> Her name's Selene.</i> <i> We were taking a tour</i> <i> of her new house,</i> <i> and something happened when</i> <i> she was showing us the sauna.</i> <i> She fell and hit her head</i> <i> and she's not moving.</i> <i> You have to send help.</i> Okay, we'll be out there as soon as we can.
What's the address? <i> I don't know.</i> <i> I just saw it on the Internet.</i> Sue, we've gotten six other calls about this girl so far, but no address or last name, just Selene.
We're getting calls from Maine, Arizona, Colorado, all of them just as clueless.
So everyone's seen this video, but no one can tell us where she is or-or who she is?
I looked her up on Instagram.
She was in the middle of touring her new Brentwood mansion when she fell.
She's a big luxury influencer.
A what?
A luxury influencer.
It's her job to be rich.
And that's it?
Pretty much.
Eddie, let's tweet out a picture of that girl from the sauna, see if anyone can ID her.
Uh... what is her name?
Selene. I just sent you her profile.
Selene. Got it.
Adding to tweet. Sent.
You need a hand looking through her socials?
Well, it can't hurt to have another pair of eyes.
So far, I can tell it's a house in Brentwood.
You can see The Getty from the pool, which means it's on the opposite side of the street.
So it's on the southern side of whatever street it's on.
Try looking through a topographical map.
Looks like the house is on a ridge.
MAY: All these houses are on ridges.
It's impossible to tell them apart.
EDDIE: Got it.
Curb number, right across the street.
8497.
(typing) MAY: Okay, now we just need a street.
EDDIE: Boom. Looks like I'm going viral.
She does have over a million followers.
And one of them claiming to be her mother.
Wait, what?
<i> HANNAH:</i> <i> They're saying online</i> that she's hurt. I-Is she hurt?
We can't tell from the stream.
They're also saying that she's in Brentwood.
Any idea where she might have gone?
She doesn't know anyone in Brentwood.
Or, at least, I didn't think she did.
She's supposed to be at school, up in Santa Barbara.
But that account, it goes so far back, and-and she's been everywhere.
This isn't her.
Clay, you have to stop.
This is not my daughter.
This is my daughter.
Not Selene. Rebecca.
We see her almost every other weekend.
And, clearly, she's been lying to us every other weekend.
She's made a mistake, and whatever happens next, she's going to need her parents.
What do we do?
We have no idea where she is.
You said she was up at school.
How would she have gotten down here?
HANNAH: She drives.
We bought her a car when she left for college.
We didn't find a car in her name.
Because it's registered in ours.

Saline ready.
All right.
(sizzling, hissing) Oh, my God.
I'm gonna try to pull her off.
Oh, God.
HEN: H-Hold it, hold it, hold it right there.
(Chimney sighs) All right, we can cut the rest free.
Okay.
Dispatch, notify First Presbyterian we're ten minutes out.
Have the specialty burn unit standing by.
(indistinct chatter over radio) MAY: She's on her way to the burn unit now.
High price to pay for living a fake life.
You think her regular life was that bad?
Maybe she felt like she was missing out on a life she could have had, if she'd been born someone else or made different choices.
Don't you wonder about stuff like that?
Not really.
Well, some people-- most people, other than you-- worry that they're not getting the full experience.
The unknown is scary. You know, FOMO. (scoffs) Fear of missing out.
You make it sound like a sickness.

My favorite.
(Serge laughs) You're gonna do great.
All right, let's go, people.
(indistinct chatter) (exhales sharply) (door closes) You can do this.
Yeah. You got this.
Yeah.
("Wedding March" playing) ♪ ♪ (sighs) (exhales sharply) ♪ ♪ (clears throat) Hi.
(quietly): Hi.
(people exclaiming) The groom came in at 11:00.
We did a final fitting on the suit.
Then a little shave and a haircut.
He went to the green room for breakfast-- tea, honey, plain bagel, toasted with butter.
We walked him down the aisle at 1:15.
He said he was fine.
I called for action at 1:36.
Bride started down the aisle at 1:42.
Groom went down at 1:44.
You call for action? For a wedding?
Wait. I-I know what this is. It... (chuckles) BOBBY: <i> Speed Wedding.</i> Two people who've never met before are matched by a team of experts and they meet for the first time at the altar.
LUCY: So they can marry someone they've never met?
People watch that?
Yeah, Athena and I watch it to unwind.
(scoffs) Amazing the lengths that people go through to justify their guilty pleasures.
No, it's-it's a sociological experiment.
It's a crapshoot.
Like all marriages.
Sir, my name is Bobby.
We're gonna check you out and find out what's going on.
No, no, no. Don't get up. You've had a nasty fall.
I was just nervous. I'm okay now.
We'll determine if you're okay, sir, please.
So, how do they pick the couples?
Oh, it's all based on compatibility tests.
You know, science.
Like online quizzes?
Uh, we're still getting married today, right?
What's the rush?
I can't end up like my sister, a sad, lonely, middle-aged woman.
(scoffs) I'm 32.
PAVEL: I'm fine. Really.
I just want to get married.
HEN: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Your heartbeat is muffled, which-which could be cause for concern.
Do you have any medical conditions?
Are you taking any medication that we should know about?
No, no, nothing like that.
Except...
Oh, oh.
Easy.
(crowd gasps) HEN: Okay, okay.
Let's get him on oxygen.
Talk to me, Hen.
His heartbeat's muffled.
I-I can barely hear it.
But when-when I listen to his right lung, I can hear it more.
What could be causing that?
Well, when I palpated his abdomen, his spleen was missing from the left side.
It was on the right.
BUCK: Heart on the right, spleen on the right.
They're supposed to be on the left.
Approximately one in 10,000 people present with dextrocardia, and I think he might be that one.
All his organs, including his heart, are on the wrong side of his body.
That's not in his questionnaire?
That's a huge thing to leave out.
Well, we do a standard medical screening.
There was nothing in his physical or his history.
HEN: We've got jugular venous distention.
Muffled heart sounds and low blood pressure.
That's three for three for Beck's triad.
Cardiac tamponade.
He's bleeding into the sack around his heart.
It's filling up, and the pressure is keeping his heart from beating fully.
Please save my husband! I can't be a widow.
Hang on, you're not married yet.
ALYSSA: Oh, my God. You're right.
I'm never gonna get married.
Oh, my God. This is a sign.
(hyperventilating) (beeping drones) HEN: He's coding.
I need to drain the blood.
(gasping) Wait, from his heart?
What if you're wrong about the dextrocardia?
I'll collapse his lung, but I thought I'd try not to do that.
Huh.
HEN: Buck, start ventilating.
I'm gonna drain the blood.
(gasps) HEN: All right.
Here we go.
♪ ♪ I can hear his heartbeat clearer now.
He's returning to normal sinus rhythm.
BOBBY: Okay. Let's move him.
I'll call it in on the way to the hospital.
(applause) (crowd chattering) (indistinct chatter over radio) Oh, he's okay. Great.
I'm just gonna need you guys to sign these releases on your way out, so we can air the footage.
Yeah, yeah, great.
No.
No.
No.
(applause on TV) Carissa and Ephraim are never gonna last.
But that compatibility score is off the charts.
Numbers aren't everything, Henrietta.
Oh.
Says the scientist.
Uh, this is not science.
(laughs) It's more like a car crash in slow motion.
(people groaning on TV) Hey. Let's watch the finale.
We can see who's right.
Mm-mm.
Tomorrow, babe.
Ah, I'm too tired tonight.
Actually, I was thinking that maybe tomorrow we could go downtown again.
There's this digital art walk happening.
Oh, please tell me this is not something else your coworkers were talking about.
Well, I read about it in the<i> Times</i> and they said it was a... modern urban adventure.
It sounded fun.
Okay.
What's going on, Karen?
First, you want to go on this culinary expedition.
(laughs) Now it's an artistic adventure.
What's next? A shopping safari?
Did you know we have 11 subscriptions to streaming services?
Since we had to cancel my credit cards, I've been getting emails to update our payment information.
11 emails.
All-all right.
Well, clearly, we need to cut back.
Or maybe we need to cut loose.
I feel old.
W-What?
At work.
Everyone in my group, most of them are a decade younger than me.
Some are double that.
Well, Karen, you're their boss.
Uh...
Of course, you've been doing this longer than them, so you're older.
Their lives just seem so different.
They go out almost every night.
Road trips on the weekends and backpacking through exotic places on their vacations.
They work hard.
And they play hard.
They're making the most of their lives.
And you're not.
KAREN: Don't get me wrong.
I love tea parties with our foster kids and watching terrible TV shows with you, but...
But you miss being that age.
Not sure I ever was that age.
(laughs softly) You know what I was like when we met.
Work hard, work harder.
And now I can't help but wonder, what did I miss out on?
<i> HEN:</i> <i> I mean, I-I get it.</i> She spent her 20s going after a very specific goal.
You know, she didn't waste time trying to figure out what she wanted like I did.
Now she's feeling like she missed out on a key part of life.
BOBBY: I thought Karen liked her job.
Yeah-- She does. It's-it's not really that.
It's like...
She never got to be really free.
So she wants to be 20 again. Work all day, party all night.
Wouldn't go back to my 20s if you paid me.
Same.
CHIMNEY: I don't know, if you could do it all over again, you wouldn't think about doing something different with your life?
BOBBY: No chance.
In my family, there was only one career option for boys: firefighter.
I didn't know you were a legacy, Cap.
Fourth generation.
BUCK: I got it.
Crypto.
LUCY: Uh, come again?
Cryptocurrency.
If you would've bought back in 2012, you'd be set for life by now.
I can't believe I missed out on that.
That's your big regret in life?
BUCK: Oh, I mean, basically did everything else before I became a firefighter.
So, yeah, no, I feel pretty good about my 20s.
(laughs) Hen, you think Karen is just, I don't know, maybe just going through a midlife crisis?
When did I become middle-aged?
Uh, w-well, you know, the life expectancy for women is-is, what, like, 80? So...
LUCY: You know, if you keep talking like that, I think this is about to be your biggest regret in life.
Or what's left of it.
(clears throat) BOBBY: Hen, you and Karen love each other.
You have a good life together.
Is it possible you're overthinking this?
HEN: I mean, she seemed worried that she'd missed out on something important.
I'm not sure how to fix that.
CHIMNEY: You can't.
No matter how much we wish we could, there's no such thing as making up for lost time.
Hey, Mom. I see a common warbler.
That's not a common warbler, dummy.
That's an orange-crowned.
Don't call your sister names, Dani.
MIMI: Wow, look at that. Whoa.
DANI: Come on, let's go.
You're awful quiet today. What's going on?
Come on. You used tell me everything.
Not anymore.
We only see you on weekends now.
I know I'm not there as much as I used to be, but I am still your mom 24/7.
Whatever's going on, you can talk to me.
I don't want to live with Dad anymore.
Okay? I want to live with you.
Oh, honey. You know why we did it this way.
It's easier for you to stay with your Dad during the week while I'm working.
And then we get to do fun things together on the weekend.
But you're never there when I need you.
I'm just a phone call away. Any time, day or night.
Even after midnight?
Especially then.
MIMI: Hey, look at that. Race you up there.
DANI: Wait for me.
Mom, look at this.
What do you think it is?
Why is it here?
I don't know.
MIMI: Cool.
Hey, Dani.
Tag, you're it.
Hey!
(laughs) Got you!
(laughs) You're it.
Hey.
Be careful, girls.
ELENA: I'm gonna get you. Gonna get you.
(laughter) I'm gonna get you.
Mom.
Elena, move!
(screaming) (siren wailing, horns honking) (indistinct radio chatter) BOBBY: This whole area was a missile base right up through the Cold War.
My guess? It's been 50 years since they capped these silos and they're not holding anymore.
All right, Buck, you got this.
Hi, I'm Bobby. What happened here?
We were just playing and, and, I don't know, the ground moved and she just disappeared.
We called for her, but she's not answering.
I want to see Mom.
BOBBY: We are gonna do everything we can for her.
I tell you what, let's go wait by the engine while they get her out. Come on.
CHIMNEY: Might be as much as 80 feet.
LUCY: There's some kind of gate over there.
Maybe it's a tunnel. We could get to her that way.
Rappelling down is gonna be the quickest way to get to her.
But it might be safer to bring her out that way.
Okay, you grab saws, I'll grab harnesses.
BOBBY: Yep, go ahead, take a seat right there.
What are they doing?
Well, it's kind of like rock climbing.
We put the harnesses on, we attach them to cables so we can lower ourselves to get to your mom.
DANI: And then you pull her out?
Won't that hurt her?
We're gonna get her out in a different way.
We're in.
Hen, we're on our way to you.
HEN: Visibility is zero.
Okay, wait, wait.
I have a visual. I can see her.
Okay, I'm on the ground.
Touchdown.
The kids... Where?
HEN: They're fine, they're fine.
Let's just focus on you right now.
Cap, we got her. <i> BOBBY: Copy that.</i> CHIMNEY: Heart rate's way up, blood pressure's really low.
Running fluids.
ANNABELLE: Can't really feel much.
Could be the adrenaline.
Likely a pelvic fracture.
Abdomen is warm to the touch, belly's full of blood.
Need... my kids.
They're waiting for you up at the surface.
(coughing) I'm not gonna make it back to them, am I?
Well, your organs may have sustained some serious trauma.
It's-it's hard for us to know just how severe it is from down here.
CHIMNEY: Once we get you to the hospital, they can assess.
So dumb, being out here.
Trying to make up for lost time.
I'm sure your girls understand.
Can I talk to them?
If we delay getting you to the hospital...
Please. I need to tell them.
Okay.
Cap, can you put the kids on the radio?
Mom needs to speak with them.
Can't we do that up top?
<i> I think it would be best</i> <i> if she did it now.</i> Copy that.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, I thought we were moving her.
She wants to talk to her kids first.
She doesn't think she's making it out of here.
HEN: She doesn't want their last memory of her to be screaming.
All right, Cap.
<i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Copy that, Chim.</i> You want to talk to your mom?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
All you have to do is push that button right there to talk to her.
Okay.
Here you go.
Mom?
<i> Mom, are you there?</i> I'm here, sweetie.
Are you girls okay?
We're scared, but we're okay.
<i> I know.</i> <i> I'm sorry that I'm scared you.</i> No, I'm sorry, Mom.
If we hadn't been playing, you wouldn't have fell.
<i> No. Not your fault.</i> Just an accident.
I know it's hard when we're apart.
<i> When it seems like</i> <i> I'm not there.</i> <i> But the secret is,</i> I'm always with you.
Even when you can't see me.

<i> ELENA:</i> <i> But...</i> we'll see you soon, right?
Yeah, baby. Soon.
<i> (Annabelle exhales)</i> Cap, she's ready to move.
Here.
Copy that, Chim.
What are we gonna say to her kids?
Nothing.
They don't hear this news from strangers.
We transport her and them to the hospital.

I guess it took a near-death experience for her to appreciate her actual life.
Mm-hmm.
Are you okay?
I just can't believe she got to me, but...
I'm wondering if I'm living my life for myself.
I came to work here after my mom almost died.
I was so afraid something else like that would happen again.
And I felt like she needed someone to look out for her.
There's nothing wrong with wanting to protect your family.
But before all that, I wanted to be someone, a very specific someone and...
(sighs) I think I'm losing that person.
Trauma often causes us to turn inward.
(both chuckle) I guess therapy is rubbing off on me.
Look, you hid in a place you knew, where you could feel safe and keep your family safe.
I understand the motivation.
Does that make me a coward?
I don't think cowards usually ask that question.
So how do I get back to that person I wanted to be?

Maybe tomorrow we can go find ourselves a nice early bird special somewhere.

87 cupcakes.

Are you hurt, ma'am? <i>
No, but</i> <i> he's gonna get me killed.</i>
<i> MAN:</i> <i> Put that phone down now,</i> <i> you crazy bitch.</i>
Doreen, you need to tell him to pull over and surrender peacefully.
<i> He won't listen.</i>
Okay, stay on the line with me.
I've got his girlfriend on the line.
Tell her to get him to stop.
I tried that. He's not interested.
Try again.
Do you have any idea where he's headed?
<i>Probably to his mama.</i> <i>She's over on Wetherly.</i> <i>Always runs to her</i> <i>when he has a problem.</i>
<i>MAN: Are you crazy? Don't</i> <i> tell them that. Give me that!</i>
Okay, suspect's mother lives on Wetherly.
He might be heading her way.

What about spike strips?
They're not in position for that.
How we doing, Doreen?
<i>He's slowing down!</i> <i> He's slowing down!</i>
Girlfriend says car's slowing down.

Suspect is about to be on foot.
Airship's up, en route now.
Finally.
<i>DOREEN:</i> <i> He's running. What do I do?</i>
Okay, stay in the vehicle and await police instructions.
Did he leave the weapon or take it with him?
<i>DOREEN:</i> <i> He's got it with him.</i>
All units, suspect remains armed.
Girlfriend is in vehicle, unarmed, awaiting instruction.
Name is Doreen.
Claudette, I had a pursuit here last week.
The suspects fled down the alley between Armadale and York Street.
Behind the burger place. Just have them take the alley cutout: Armadale and York.
Not now. Linda, give me something.
Airship's on the scene, joining pursuit.
Okay.
Mom's house is six blocks away.
Units are on the way to intercept.
And here I thought for once we'd go through a whole shift without a pursuit.
Josh, you knew better than to make that bet.
<i>OFFICER: 44. We are now</i> <i> in foot pursuit,</i> <i> approaching Armadale.</i>
Copy. In foot pursuit.
Units, if you take the alley between Armadale and York, you should be able to cut the suspect off.

<i>OFFICER:</i> <i> Dispatch, we're Code 4.</i> Copy.
Code 4. <i> Suspect in custody.</i>
JOSH: Nice job.
The alley cutoff was inspired.
Yeah, it seemed like the obvious call.
"Obvious call"? Yeah, obvious, because I told her to do it.
So, you want the credit.
I just want an acknowledgement that other people exist in her world.
You don't know what she's like.
Oh, no, I know the type.
I had more than a few sergeants just like her coming up.
Yeah, that sort of behavior went out a long time ago.
She's a dinosaur, a bully.
I just need to stand up to her, I know.
Yeah, stand up for yourself.
Talk to her. Work it out.
Well, I thought we had, but with Claudette it's always two steps forward, and then get stabbed in the back.
If anything's pushing me to go to college, it's her.
No, you do that because you want to go, not because you were chased there.
Well, thank you, guys, and thank you for breakfast.
Mm-hmm.
Have a wonderful day, sweetheart.
Thank you. I have another shift.
All right. Go get 'em.
Hey. Maybe you should talk to the dinosaur.
No, no, no. I promised May I wouldn't.
What about Sue? Did you promise not to talk to her, too?
So you think I should ask to speak to the manager?
Yes. And if you don't, I will.

I'll take a look when I'm done moving these, and you guys wanted to go paperless.
Correction. He did.
I didn't realize it was going to be a parade.
Scanner's on two, so we have to bring paperwork from high and low, literally.
It's more like a ballet.
How about more Twyla and less Fosse?
I'll try.
After I google what that means.
How's your coffee?
(chuckles) I have to say, I never thought -- not in a million years -- that I would love a superfood creamer made from coconut milk and marine algae.
The algae's where they get the calcium.
(laughing): You truly have become one of us.
Yeah.
But maybe you're not planning on being one of us forever?
Uh...the whole desk thing is still a little new to me.
I'm used to being out there, riding the rig, slinging the hoses, working up a sweat.
You don't work up a sweat slinging tweets?
Different kind of sweat.
(laughs) When I was in my 20s, my mother liked to say, repeatedly, "Linda, you can tie yourself in knots "trying to find a career that suits you, "but at the end of the day, God will tell you where you need to be in this world." Mm.
Well, I hope he gives me a shout soon.
Yeah.
You took my ambulance?!
Excuse you?
You redirected my ambulance.
That unit was closer to a higher priority emergency, a bigger casualty risk.
But I'd already told my caller that...
Did you get a unit there?
Yes.
And was your victim alive when you disconnected?
(scoffs) That's not the point.
But it is, sweetie. That's exactly the point.
We're not children here competing for the best LEGOs to build our pretend skyscrapers with.
We are a team.
Is that what we are?
We're a team? Why didn't I think of that?
I don't know.
Youth? Inexperience?
Indifference? You tell me.
No.
The rest of us are a team, but you're not.
Sweetie...
I'm not your sweetie!
Enough! Come with me.
Get your girl, Sue.
SUE: Both of you. Let's go.
Terry, it's not even lunch yet, and I am having a day.
My tablet won't work, I've got boxes all over my call center.
How else are you going to turn my world upside down?
Can I help you?
You're not Terry.
No.
He just took off.
Okay.
I'll just, uh...
Who are you?
Carson. I'm installing the new clean agent system.
Oh. Clean agents.
Much better than the dirty agent, am I right?
Right.
(metallic clacking nearby) It's a fire suppression system.
Oh, I'm aware. Dispatchers know all about this stuff.
It uses the inert gas to suck all the oxygen out of the room.
Thought only my mother could do that.
It would suffocate her pretty quick.
Yeah, leaves you breathless I guess.
Always wondered what that felt like.
(clears throat) Oh, I should introduce myself.
I'm...
Josh.
Wait. You know my name?
Terry was giving me the grand tour yesterday, and, um, I asked about you.
You seem really good at what you do.
Thanks.
I, uh...I'm gonna go down to the basement and connect power to this thing.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
Uh, to the elevator.
Isn't Dispatch upstairs?
Yeah, you know what? You're right.
(chuckles) Nice meeting you, clean agent, uh...
Carson.
Yeah.
I'm much nicer than that other agent.
Oh. Yeah.
(laughs) Nice. You got us sent to the principal's office.
Shouldn't have stolen my ambulance.
Oh, are you feeling nostalgic for middle school again?
You only graduated, what, last week?
Give it a rest.
(Claudette chuckles) Well, this is tragic.
Oh, you want to know what's tragic?
The fact that you're still talking.
(scoffs) Finally.
And you.
I expected more from you.
So, welcome to the quiet room.
Designed for dispatchers who need a little time off the floor, or in this case, a time-out.
(buzzing) (beeps) Carson, I just got an alert about the fire suppression system.
(rhythmic beeping) What the hell?
(rhythmic beeping continues) Oh!
(electrical hissing) (screaming) What is that?
(electrical buzzing) (sighs) Well, I need to go and check on whatever that was.
Try not to kill each other while I'm gone.
We can't spare the resources.
(hissing) No! No!
(knocking) Hey.
Hey.
Did you get it, too?
Yeah, power surge.
No, this alert.
"Fire suppression system." Is that the sprinklers or the new CAS?
It's that, uh, waterless system.
Yeah, sucks all the oxygen out of a room.
I met the guy who was installing it.
Hmm. If you met him, you should go talk to him.
Oh, uh, I-I can't.
I've-I've got the floor, and Sue is dealing with, um...
Oh. Yeah, I heard it.
Everyone heard.
All right, I'm on it.
Great.
(gasping) (coughing) (elevator bell dings) (beeping) Terry?! Terry?!
(alarm buzzing) All right, come on, Terry.
Terry? Hey, there we go.
Terry, can you hear me?
Yeah. Yeah.
System shorted out.
Couldn't make it to the door.
Hmm.
Okay.
All right. (panting) Can you hold yourself up?
Yeah.
All right.
(Terry panting) Be right back.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is <i> Firefighter Eddie Diaz</i> <i>on a department-wide channel.</i> <i>We have a fire</i> <i> at Metro Dispatch downtown.</i> <i>Point of origin appears to be on</i> <i>the second floor records room.</i> All non-essential personnel begin <i> evacuation procedures.</i> Repeat. This is Firefighter Eddie Diaz.
Metro Dispatch is on fire.
Why is this even in here?
Okay. How long before you think we can head back there and just tell them we worked it all out?
I have no idea.
Okay, you know what? We need a plan.
Let me see if I can figure out how to save the day again.
And don't worry. You can take all the credit again, too.
Are you really seriously about to throw another temper tantrum?
I did not throw a tantrum!
Rockabye baby.
Listen, we are now in the quiet room, so you might want to use this time to be alone with your thoughts.
So allow me to provide you with one.
You stood in the middle of the floor yelling and lecturing me about not being a team player.
And yet, your panties are all in a bunch because you didn't get the credit.
Let me tell you something, baby girl.
There's no "I" in "team." Think about that.
(sirens wailing) All right, guys, let's get ready to go.
Captain Shore.
Captain Nash. You're first on the scene.
BOBBY: Eddie.
Records room on the second floor is fully involved.
Fire could spread to the third floor. That's the main floor.
Hen. The clean agent system knocked him out for a second.
He took in a lot of gas, but there could be a lingering narcotic effect.
Okay, I got him.
Okay, Hen, I want you to set up a triage area in the parking garage next door.
Copy that, Cap. I'm gonna need a hand.
It is Monday.
Fine. You'll do.
Happy to help.
HEN: All right, let's go.
Jonah, take Meyers and Ortiz with you.
Okay. Come on, guys.
What do you think? Triage over there, so they could put the command center here?
Yeah, works for me. I'll get it rolling.
Okay. Come on.
So let's get these vehicles removed.
I want immediate, minor and delayed over here, command post officers and assistants over there.
There's going to be a lot of smoke inhalation, so stack up the O2 bottles as the rescues respond in.
And give me plenty of room to work.
I need my space.
I want crews at the Delta side, as well.
Chimney, put together a team from the 133, raise the ladders and start hitting that corner window.
Copy that. Han, you're with me.
Guess we're working together. Should be fun.
Rookie, do everything I tell you to do.
Or not.
Buck, Lucy, suit up. You're going inside.
You're gonna hit the fire at the source on two.
Go.
Go.
(sighs) You're right.
I wanted the credit. The validation, I guess.
And maybe it was me being all Gen-Z, but I was trying to stand up for everybody.
You know, we don't do enough of that in this world.
That's kind of deep.
For real.
Hmm.
You should have read my college essay.
Wait.
Why aren't you in college?
Why do you care?
Girl.
I wasn't ready to go.
I just needed more time, but now I'm out of time, and USC sent me this letter, and they want me to make my decision, and I'm still trying to figure out what to do.
(sighs) You should quit.
Yeah, you would love that.
No, I wouldn't.
I told you once that I saw greatness in you.
And you know I don't say anything I don't mean.
But maybe your greatness is meant for something else.
Like what?
I don't know.
And you don't know, either.
'Cause you've got your whole life ahead of you.
Get the hell out of here and go to college.
Hang around with some people your own age.
Fill your head with some knowledge, and do some things. Some crazy things, some courageous things, and maybe even some naughty things.
(both chuckle) Because...this job, it comes with a price, and it's a heavy one.
And it's also one I never want to see you have to pay.
You know I'm right.
Because you're always right.
Yeah, and because if you were sure you wanted to be a dispatcher for the rest of your life, you'd have already thrown that letter away.
Captain Nash, my people are initializing our disaster protocols, which means they're gonna need help turning a sizable part of that parking garage into a mobile dispatch center so we can keep taking calls.
How's the volume?
Oh, it's unusually high.
There's no way that Valley can handle all the traffic. (coughs) Contact Paramedic Greenway from the 133 and coordinate with him.
Any of my people can help you set up.
Well, thank you. Oh, I also have five of my senior dispatchers still taking calls upstairs.
Unless the fire's encroaching, they won't stand down till we get the trunk line connected.
You said senior dispatchers.
So May has been evacuated?
She's still up there?
I put her in the quiet room with Claudette.
I am so sorry. With all this craziness, I forgot.
Where is this quiet room?
It's on the third floor.
It's behind main dispatch.
That's just above the source of the fire.
SUE: What?!
Eddie, get some turnouts.
Now. Go. Captain Shore, I'm passing the baton.
You're the new IC. I'm going in.
Why is Cap going in?
May's still up there.
Feels like I'm missing something.
Family history.
Let's go.
BOBBY: Donato, you're with me. Eddie, you're with Buck.
Let's hit it.
Why it so hot in here?
Yeah.
It's hotter on this side.
Yeah.
It feels like it's coming from someplace over here.
Something's wrong. Something's very wrong.
MAY: Claudette, get back.
(echoes): Claudette, get back.
Get back!
(muttering): I don't like fire.
I don't like it. I don't like fire.
I don't like fire.
TAYLOR: If you're just joining us, the Downtown Metro Dispatch Center has suffered some kind of power surge which, as you can see, has sparked a fire inside the building.
Evacuations are in progress, although I'm hearing that the danger has not spread to the actual dispatch floor yet.
(coughing) There's no way out the other direction.
(panting) Both hallways are fully involved.
But somebody's got to be coming for us.
Nobody's coming. They can't save us.
Claudette, we're in the 911 call center.
Someone should be coming to find us.
Okay, give me your jacket so I can wet it.
Come on! Give me your jacket.
(coughing) Oh, my God. Claudette.
I don't like fire. (sniffles) Sue, I'm fine now. I can help.
Oh, good.
So, I've reconciled the duty roster and the visitor log.
Everybody in the building is accounted for except for May and Claudette.
I know they're gonna get them out of there.
So, this is the only other name. He signed in this morning.
Carson. Yeah, he was installing the clean agent system.
When was the last time you saw him?
I don't remember.
Okay, let's go.
<i>SHORE:</i> <i> This is Captain Shore.</i> <i>I need two firefighters</i> <i> for search and rescue.</i> <i>Worker named Carson Hayes,</i> <i> last seen on level two,</i> <i>could still be in the building.</i>
This is Diaz. Buckley and I<i> are</i> on two.
We swept the whole floor.
This is dispatcher Russo.
<i> I think I know where he is.</i> Go ahead, Josh.
<i> He told me he was going</i> <i>to the basement</i> to connect power to the system.
It's probably the electrical vault.
I can meet you on two and take you down there.
Negative, we got this. Buck!
Take this for me.
I got it.
But I-I'm right by the fire stairs.
I-I could be down there right away.
Josh, you're a dispatcher, not a firefighter.
Today, you're a guest in this house.
He's been waiting months to say that.
SUE: Captain Shore, good news.
Mobile dispatch is almost ready to go live.
SHORE: Maybe not that ready.
Fire's broke through to the third floor.
That roof might be compromised.
Along with that radio tower.
SUE: Well, that's our only connection to every truck, ladder and ambulance in the city.
And not just downtown.
Valley, too?
All of it.
SUE: If that tower goes, it doesn't matter how many calls we take.
We can't send anyone to rescue anyone anywhere.
Han brothers, take this ladder, reposition it to the roof.
Take a team up there and start venting it.
And secure that tower.
Copy that.
Albert.
All right, Albert, once I clear this area, you're good to go!
ALBERT: Copy that.
CHIMNEY: All right.
Get me ventilation here to there. Move!
How we doing up there, Han?
If we bind the straps to the base of this tower, think we'll be golden.
What do you think about over there?
CHIMNEY: Sounds like a plan.
Albert!
Albert.
(grunts) Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
You're not dizzy? Can you see? How many of me are there?
Thankfully just the one. I couldn't handle more of you.
(Claudette coughing) I don't know why the sprinklers aren't on.
It's getting closer.
You think it's gonna knock?
It goes everywhere, eats everything.
Claudette.
Smells like meat.
When it cooks you, and your-your blood burns, too.
That smells like copper.
Claudette.
Can't forget that smell.
Sometimes I remember, comes out of nowhere.
Hits like a...
(fire whooshes) (Claudette grunts) Claudette, listen to me.
You didn't die then, and you're not gonna die now.
Don't worry, don't worry. It only hurts for a sec.
Then it takes your nerve endings out.
You won't feel a thing. You won't -- You won't feel a thing, o-okay?
No, you won't feel it. We won't feel it.
We won't feel...
LUCY: Cap, we can't get to them this way.
(echoing): Cap.
Cap? What's the plan?
EDDIE: This way, this way, this way.
Josh said he's in the electrical vault.
Okay. Here we are.
Got him.
Carson?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Josh let us know you're down here.
CARSON: Josh? I'm glad he remembered.
Let me guess.
Arc blast?
Yeah. The suppression blanket took the hit.
I got too close.
I crawled over here to get my phone.
Well, we're on no signal down here.
(screams) My leg really hurts.
BP is 130/80.
Little high. We're gonna give you something for the pain, Carson.
Should kick in soon.
Oh, please.
EDDIE: I'm also gonna need to cut through this pant leg.
Do what you got to do.
I gave up trying to yell for help.
What's going on up there?
BUCK: Uh, well, the building's on fire.
Well, that's not embarrassing.
Arc blast is not your fault.
This is a very old building.
Who knows what kind of faulty wiring was down here?
(grunts) Oh!
Why did I tell you to do that?
Hey, I know it looks bad, but not a lot of blood.
That's a good thing.
Oh, isn't that always a good thing?
EDDIE: (chuckles) You got me there.
How's that morphine?
Good.
Okay, we're gonna splint this and we're gonna get you out of here.
Can they fix it, or am I gonna be the next contestant on<i> So You Think You Can Sit?</i> Now, listen, I had an entire fire truck fall on my leg, and hey, look at me now.
That sounds horrible.
No, horrible was the blood clots you get after.
Mine was in my lung. I was coughing up blood.
And they put you on these blood thinners and...
Buck.
You guys should take this act on the road.
Let's get you out of here first.
BOBBY: May!
May! May, can you hear me?
(thudding) BOBBY (distant): May! May!
SHORE: Let's knock it down quick and get this area ready for extraction.
(coughing) Help is here.
Come on, it's time to go.
Josh, we're on-line down here, ready to cut the power.
<i>Start wrapping it up up there.</i> Copy that. Wait for my signal.
All right, anyone who's ready, let's hit the stairs.
I'm not going anywhere, sir.
Linda.
I can't leave.
Elderly man went out on a walk in the Palisades.
Wandered into Will Rogers Park, can't find his way back.
Any luck on a location?
He's not near any major cell towers.
All units responding to the Westbrook Avenue section of Pacific Palisades, please report.
(explosion overhead) Linda, we got to go.
<i> ATHENA:</i> <i> 727-L-30 on scene.</i> <i> I've got the subject.</i> Terry, we're on the move.
Cut the generator.
(coughs) You can't win. It doesn't care.
So that's it.
You're just a playground bully that likes to pick on little kids to feel better about herself.
It's actually pretty pathetic.
You don't like me because I'm younger and more competent than you ever were.
And yeah, people like me, a lot.
So just lay there and die like the old dinosaur that you are.
Y-You're such a baby girl...
And you just want to die?
You want to die?
Answer me! Do you want to die?!
No.
Then move your ass.
Now!
BOBBY: Okay.
(coughing) Hey, all right.
Let's get her some O2.
All right, all right.
Breathe. You're okay. Here we go.
I got you.
BOBBY: Are you okay?
MAY: Better now.
(screams) Keep moving, keep moving!
May, don't tell your mother about that.
Okay.
(coughing) Almost out!
Go. I'll wait for Cap and May.
Han, you good?
Yeah.
All right, nice work!
Let's get out of here!
Albert!
Go, go, go!
CHIMNEY: I got you.
I got you.

You didn't have to lie.
I wasn't.
I have two dads and you're one of them.
(indistinct radio chatter) SUE: You doing okay?
Yeah.
Fine.
Cleared for duty by the paramedics.
Why don't you take five, anyway? Looks like you could use it.
You know what?
I'm gonna take you up on that.
(sniffles) Oh, wait.
Do we do background checks when we hire contractors?
Yes. They're quite extensive.
Great.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Terrible at my job?
I think this whole thing is my fault.
Oh...
Are you kidding?
This building is...was ancient.
We were due for an upgrade.
Upgrades used to be my specialty.
There's no reason why they still can't be.
Hey.
How you doing?
Thought I lost you there for a second.
Me, too.
You know how they say your, uh, whole life flashes before your eyes?
Mine kind of sucked.
(laughs softly) Albert, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's not your fault.
No, it was.
You never should've been on that roof.
Howard, it...
You were trying to tell me something the other day, and I wasn't ready to hear it.
(sighs) You know, me and Pop have never really had a great relationship, and I know that he thinks me being a firefighter is the stupidest thing I've ever done.
It's not stupid.
You're a hero.
And you're my brother, so...you looking up to me, wanting to follow in my footsteps...it meant the world to me, you know?
That's actually why I didn't want to disappoint you so badly.
Just wish I could be half as good at this as you are.
Hey, listen.
Don't settle for being half of anything, okay?
Go out there and be something that allows you to be a hundred percent you.
What are you saying?
I'm saying I love you.
And I want you to quit.
If that's what you want.
(laughs) (exhales) This is silly. I feel like I just pulled something.
We will let the MRI confirm that.
Don't need an MRI, just need some ibuprofen.
Is he kidding right now?
No.
He is a terrible patient.
Look, you are getting that MRI, even if I have to throw you in the machine kicking and screaming.
Listen, Sergeant... (grunts) All right, all right. I won't be doing any kicking.
Exactly. A roof fell on you.
I am fine. This is not a big deal.
It was to me.
You saved my life.
So please, get the damn MRI.
Okay.
Well, this is what I get for disobeying your orders.
You did tell me not to go down there.
I'm so glad you did, Papa Bear.
Lucy Donato.
I'm Taylor...Taylor Kelly.
Yeah. Heard a lot about you.
Same.
Uh, did you want a comment?
You don't know what the 118 means to him.
I know all firefighters, they live together and work together and...
probably do feel like a family some of the time.
But for Buck, that firehouse is his family.
When things gets messy at the 118, he falls apart.
I'd hate for things to get messy again.
She's a peach.
Hey, so, uh, he-he -- he's good, right?
He had some pain in his leg on the way in.
Might be a pinched nerve.
Mm.
Well, with all that he's been through, he's lucky that's all that it is.
Yeah, I think a lot of people got lucky today.
JONAH: Coming through!
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Give me something.
Decompressions.
Wh...
JONAH: I got her.
HEN: Jonah!
You're gonna make it!
Jonah.
She coded in the ambulance.
DOCTOR: What happened?
Patient suffered cardiac arrest en route. No pulse.
How long has she been down?
12 minutes.
DOCTOR: Let's call it.
(panting) Jonah, what happened?
She was fine when I left triage.
Pressure bottomed out.
Couldn't get her rhythm back.
It's weird.
I should've been able to save her.
I usually save them.
Hen.
She was fine. I-I don't understand.
Neither do I.
<i> It was weird.</i>
It was weird, or he was weird?
"I should have been able to save her." That's what he said.
Like she was a math problem or...a missed point in a tennis match and-and not a human being.
Well, maybe that's just how he packs it away.
There's packing away and there's throwing away.
Look, you always say that when you're out there, all you've got is your instincts.
And truth is, you've never liked the guy.
So maybe there's a reason why.
I think there is.

You saved him.

(laughs) <i>ATHENA: Anyone</i> want a cup of tea?
Yeah.
How about you? Maybe some lunch?
I noticed you didn't eat anything at the reception.
It felt weird eating at Claudette's house after her funeral. It's a weird custom.
Yeah. It's to comfort the family, remember the deceased.
You know, share some stories, maybe even laugh.
How are you? You look tired.
It was my first time going to her house.
Meeting her family. You know, I'm not sure if she'd ever talked about them.
Well, a lot of people like to keep their work life and home life separate.
MAY: I just always thought she was this awful person who only existed to make my life hell.
But she was a wife and a mom.
She had a family that loved her.
And if I hadn't gotten into that argument with her...
May, no.
There's no way you could have known that building was gonna catch on fire.
BOBBY: Your mother is right. Whatever happened to Claudette is not your fault.
Feels like it should be somebody's fault.
<i> CHIMNEY:</i> <i> Never understood these things.</i> You know?
I mean, what are you supposed to do with them after?
I don't know, put them in a drawer and throw them out five years later?
What were you even doing at her funeral?
Seemed like the right thing to do.
She died on our watch.
It's not the first time that that's happened.
We don't normally go to a funeral.
Hen.
All right.
I had this crazy idea in my mind.
Some questions about Claudette's death.
So I went to the funeral to try and get some answers.
What kind of questions?
Just didn't make any sense, Chim. She was fine.
And then she coded.
And then she was dead.
We see weird stuff every day.
That's probably all this was.
Except for the spiders.
Are the spiders where the crazy comes in?
There was another call. Right before you came back to work. It was a kid <i> who had multiple tarantula</i> <i>bites. He was stable.</i> <i> So I left him alone with Jonah</i> <i> and then he coded.</i> Just like Claudette.
It's most likely a coincidence.
I mean, Claudette had hypertension.
How would you know that?
I may have looked in her medicine cabinet during the post-funeral reception. But I... (sighs) High blood pressure.
High blood pressure combined with smoke inhalation would put a lot of stress on the heart.
Could cause a cardiac event.
Exactly.
Except...her BP would have been stable at the scene.
Wait, how do you know that?
Because you did her assessment.
If her vitals hadn't been stable, you would've shipped her out priority.
I think you're onto something here.
You believe me.
Always.
Chris, hurry up.
We still got to pick up Tía Pepa.
Shouldn't take that long to pack a toothbrush.
BUCK: Why don't you just take a later flight?
You were at a funeral, you know?
Y-Your parents will understand.
They should understand.
What is the dress code at a retirement party?
Tie is probably too much.
It is my parents we're talking about.
I'll just grab it all.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I have to go.
My mom made this huge deal about this party.
He did work at the company for 40 years.
And Chris...he's excited to see everyone, he misses them.
40 years -- that's a long time.
Uh, you said he was in oil, right?
Petroleum engineer.
Spent his whole life driving across the state.
Living everywhere but under his own roof with his own family.
Listen, uh, as-as someone who also comes from a screwed-up family...
My family isn't screwed up.
Just my dad, okay?
Plan is get in, get out without any drama.
Say congratulations, have some cake and...
(clicks tongue) call it a day.
And what about when he starts to get in there and push your buttons?
There's a hotel 20 minutes away, three-and-a-half stars.
Chris is really gonna like the pool.
Chris!
CHIMNEY (whispers): Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Can't believe you're having us break into Cap's office.
HEN: All right.
All right, come on, Chim. We need to find a copy of the paramedic transfer forms that Jonah submitted for Claudette and Perry, our spider bite pet sitter, see Jonah's account of what happened to them.
Or we could log on to the computer, pull up Jonah's personnel file.
Here.
Oh, how are you gonna get in there?
Did you become a computer hacker while you were gone?
Well, I was living in a basement, but...not exactly dealing with the Enigma machine here.
Here we go.
HEN: Found 'em both.
All right, Perry Nivens.
Patient was found unconscious following multiple tarantula bites, no other symptoms present.
Paramedic Greenway pushed steroids.
Prior to transport, the patient went into cardiac arrest.
Paramedic Greenway quickly and ably was able to restore a normal rhythm through the use of defibrillation.
Patient was transported for follow-up care to the ER.
Sounds just like you told me.
Language a little more flowery than I'm used to.
Claudette Collins.
Patient suffering from smoke inhalation, no other symptoms were observed.
Paramedic Greenway administered nebulized albuterol, during transport patient went into cardiac arrest.
Despite Paramedic Greenway's valiant efforts, defibrillation and manual compression did not restore normal rhythm.
Patient was pronounced DOA at the Emergency Room.
Well, there's definitely a pattern.
In his reports, if nothing else.
Whoa.
Did you know Jonah's only been with the LAFD for 14 months?
What?
Before that, he was a paramedic in Chicago, Miami, Dallas, Denver, and now L. A.
He moves around more than a carnival worker.
(bell ringing) Oh, no, they're here.
(truck brakes squeak) Oh, no, we're caught.
We're not caught.
Just act cool, follow my lead.
I make no promises.
Hey, Hen, Chimney.
Thought you guys were off today.
Yeah, we are.
Then what are you doing here? (chuckles) And what's with all the 902Ms?
Oh, we were just, uh, working on...
A special project for the mayor.
W... Seriously? Well, what kind of project?
Beta testing a new piece of equipment for us to use in the field. We just needed to, uh, go over some of the data from our transfer forms.
Just need data.
LUCY: Data.
Sounds official.
Well, we better get going.
The mayor's office is gonna want that report ASAP.
Have a great shift.
CHIMNEY: See ya.
You're a terrible liar.
And you're too good.
What do you think they're hiding?
'Round here, I find it's best not to know.
What are we doing?
I'm rummaging through a dead woman's medicine cabinet.
I've got you breaking into the captain's office, looking at confidential personnel files.
We're trying to prove whether or not Jonah was a bad paramedic.
What if we're wrong?
What if we're not?
He's out there right now.
<i> Someone's calling for help,</i> <i> and that guy's gonna show up?</i> <i> He's holding their lives</i> <i> in his hands,</i> and we don't know what he's gonna do with them.
Why don't I give you something for the pain?
You sure that's okay?
Trust me.
Oh, something's wrong.
EDDIE: (grunts) I haven't even shut off the engine. (groans) PEPA: Mami.
Hi.
PEPA: <i> ¿Que paso?</i> Nada.
Where's Christopher?
Out like a light ever since we left the car rental place.
<i>Ay, pobrecito mi angelito.</i> (chuckles) Abuela, it's so good to see you.
L. A. feels a little less like home without you there.
Same here.
Mm.
PEPA: So, now, what's wrong?
Your mother is in there doing all the cooking.
PEPA: What?
I thought my fancy brother hired caterers for his big<i> parranda.</i> The caterers are only allowed to warm and serve the food. Helena insisted on making everything herself.
(Pepa sighs) Everything.
You didn't help out at all?
I was allowed to make the tamales.
PEPA: Ay, gracias.
(laughing) Thank you.
I'm gonna go wake Chris, okay?
ISABEL: Yes, of course.
EDDIE: Mom, come on. You got to take a break.
No, leave me alone, I'm almost done.
Everything looks perfect.
Yeah, okay.
I'm sure it tastes great, too.
(smack) I'm kidding.
It's so good to have my boys back home.
RAMON: It's been too long. You should come visit more often.
EDDIE: Pretty sure planes fly in both directions.
Well, now that your father's retired, we'll have time to visit more.
Yeah, I can't believe it's actually happening.
HELENA: Oh, God.
Oh, did you show him the watch?
RAMON: Oh, it's nothing.
HELENA: No, no show him.
It was a nice gesture.
(Ramon groans) Show me.
Here, it's... (chuckles) Wow.
"In recognition of your 40 years of service "helping us reach new horizons for our company, "and for all of our stakeholders, "the board thanks you.
From our family to yours." It's not quite a Silver Star.
But it-but it's something...I guess.
Ah, it's, uh, nice. Congratulations, Dad.
(box lightly thumps) Feels strange.
Being unemployed, it's...
No meetings to rush off to.
No phone calls to juggle.
No...no reason to get out of bed at 4:00 A. M.
I-I...I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself.
I bet.
(mutters): Why live if you're not working?
RAMON: So, how's life as an operator?
<i>ATHENA:</i> <i> Love you.</i> <i> All right, talk to you</i> <i> in the morning?</i> Okay, bye-bye.
How many times are you planning to check on May?
(sighs) Until I'm sure she's okay.
Mm. That you're both okay.
Oh, it's my turn in the hot seat now.
You pulled a woman out of a fire and then she died in front of you at the hospital.
I know that's not easy.
Her husband came to find me at the funeral.
Wanted to shake my hand, thank me for doing what I could.
What'd you say?
That I wish I could've done more.
But there has to be something you can do, right?
Chimney and I put in a few calls, talked to some other paramedics that Jonah worked with.
Almost everyone says the same thing.
That he's a little odd, that he's overeager, but he's a good paramedic.
Almost?
Well...there was this one guy over at the 122 -- him and Jonah responded to a fender bender.
Mm-hmm.
They were treating the driver for a concussion and some airbag abrasions.
He left Jonah alone with the driver.
And when he came back, the driver was in full arrest.
He died on the scene.
Okay, babe, once is a mistake.
Twice is a coincidence.
Three times is a pattern.
You need to tell someone.
I don't have any proof.
I file a complaint, he denies it, moves on and becomes some other department's problem.
Okay, well, what about those other cities?
Well, if he'd had a trail of suspicious deaths, I don't think the LAFD would've hired him.
Well, doesn't have to be deaths.
Just a pattern of suspicious behavior.
I mean, nobody starts with murder.
<i> (knocking)</i> <i> CHIMNEY: Hang on, I'm coming.</i> They never start with murder.
I'm sorry, Pat, I'm gonna need to buy a vowel.
Murderers.
They never start with murder.
People like Jonah, they always have some kind of origin story.
"The mayor called 13-year-old Jonah Greenway "a 'hometown hero' "for successfully resuscitating his school bus driver after a heart attack behind the wheel." So Jonah was, like, a kid hero?
Yeah, th-there's dozens of-of articles, interviews.
They gave him the damn key to the city and paid for college.
Saving that driver made him an overnight celebrity.
I got full of myself after I'd ace an English test.
I can't imagine what something like this would do to a kid's ego.
Or how he'd feel when the attention went away.
He'd probably miss the adulation.
So much so that maybe he'd try to recreate the experience.
Over and over.
A malignant hero.
He didn't want to kill people.
He wanted to push them to the brink of death so that he could have the glory of saving them.
You could only do that for so long before you slip up.
People would start to suspect.
And then you move on, from city to city.
Miami, Chicago, Dallas, Denver...
Los Angeles.
We've been doing all this sleuthing and he's been hiding in plain sight on the local news.
He still is.
(knocking) Uh, hi. Is everything okay?
We need to talk to Taylor.
(door closes) Good morning.
Sorry, I-I know it's early.
TAYLOR: Yeah.
It was even earlier when she woke me up.
HEN: We were hoping that, uh, we could watch some of your footage from the call center fire.
Is that something you could access from here?
Theoretically...yes.
Why?
Yeah.
Well, theoretically, I want to see what happened before Claudette coded.
The dispatcher who died on her way to the hospital?
I-Is something going on, did the family make a complaint?
Yeah, it's-it's fine, Buck, I'm happy to help.
Why don't you make us some coffee?
I'm sure we all could use a cup.
Is this what you're looking for?
<i> (both laugh)</i> <i> JONAH: You know,</i> <i> I'd say you don't really</i> <i> have, uh, have the looks</i> <i> to be a phone operator.</i> It's crazy -- she-she seems fine.
How do you go from laughing one second to coding the next?
Wait a minute. Can you rewind?
Yeah.
HEN: Stop it right there.
CHIMNEY: What do you think that is -- potassium?
HEN: I'm not sure.
O-Okay, come on, guys, wh-what's going on here?
Buck, we're not sure.
BUCK: We're not gonna tell anyone.
Right?
Off the record.
Claudette was alert and conversant.
Her BP and her heart rate were stable.
Protocol dictates that the only treatment necessary in that case is respiratory, to treat the smoke inhalation.
Meaning?
HEN: Meaning Jonah had no reason to push drugs of any kind.
Are you saying her death wasn't related to her injuries?
Whatever drug Jonah was pushing on that video caused her heart to stop.
What... on-on purpose?
Maybe.
Come on, Hen, I...I-I know you didn't always like the guy, but he-he's still one of us, you know? It cou-it could've just been a mistake.
Buck, did that look like a mistake to you?
He injected her with something, and she had a heart attack.
How-how can you be sure?
CHIMNEY: Claudette wasn't the first time.
Other people have died on his watch under suspicious circumstances.
Okay, so-so, maybe he's a-he's a bad paramedic.
Or maybe he is a serial killer.
♪ ♪ RAMON: I-I picked out a nice bolero.
And then we-we just get up and we say thank you and then-and then we do our little dance and that's it.
What's going on?
Your father's nervous about giving a speech.
Oh!
(Isabel laughs) PEPA: Oh! Por favor.
Ramon, you never met a microphone you didn't love.
HELENA: Yes.
I'm surprised you're not singing, too.
Oh, what?
EDDIE: Yeah, come on, Aunt Pepa's right. I'm sure there's a story you could tell.
Actually, I was gonna tell one about you.
You know, the-the day I came home and found that the entire side of my truck had been scraped off, HELENA: Oh.
including the side mirror and the front bumper.
HELENA: Oh, my gosh, yes, when Adriana was born.
You never told me about that.
When Adriana was born, and, uh, Ramon was off on business, I told that Eddie that my water broke.
And he jumped up, he ran out of the room, and I thought, of course, he's going to call someone to drive us to the hospital.
And then I hear a loud crash, right? From the garage.
Ah.
I walk in there, there's Eddie behind the wheel of Ramon's prized pickup.
Barely seeing over the steering wheel, with the whole side of the truck, like, just completely torn to shreds.
(chuckling) He was trying to drive me to the hospital.
Why I'm not surprised, huh?
Eddie to the rescue, my little hero.
Didn't have much of a choice.
Ah, you had many choices.
But you were just a kid, I-I forgave you for that.
EDDIE: No, actually, you didn't. you-you grounded me.
Edmundo, it's-it's just a story.
Yeah, it's a real sweet one. I...
Except he's just...he's missing the whole part where he tore me a new one for ruining his truck.
You know, kind of like the time he yelled at me for setting off the smoke alarms for making eggs for the girls when I was 12. I'm sure Edmundo.
there's a better story you can tell up there.
Oh, uh, why don't you tell them about the time you pulled your ten-year-old son aside and told him it was time to step up?
Be the man of the house?
Why don't you tell them about that time?
Then we can all understand why you were never around.
I was providing for the family.
Providing?
(laughs): Providing what -- money?
HELENA: Okay...
Exactly.
I had to do what I had to do.
A family needs more than money.
Look, I never had a childhood, a dad who took care of me. No, you were gone.
The only thing you provided...
HELENA: Okay, Eddie, Eddie, stop, stop.
Ramon!
Ramon, Ramon.
Dad? Dad. Okay, just breathe.
ISABEL:<i> Mijo, mijo.</i> Oh my God, Ramon.
Breathe.
(panting) HELENA: Is he having a heart attack?
No, it's not a heart attack. All right.
Open your mouth, under your tongue.
You know the drill.
HELENA: What-what drill?
What are-what are these pills?
Nitroglycerin.
It helps open up his blood vessels, settles the circulation.
Just like the doctor said, am I right?
HELENA: What doctor?
ISABEL: What's going on?
Ramon, what did you do?
I'm guessing you went to go see a cardiologist.
Probably on one of your business trips, am I right?
How many stents do you have in your arteries?
HELENA: What?
When?
Three years ago.
I...I went to Dr. Fernandez.
He's the finest cardiologist in Dallas.
Why didn't you tell me?
Pride.
He didn't want us to think he was weak.
<i> JONAH (on laptop):</i> <i> You know, I'd say</i> <i> you don't really have, uh,</i> <i> the looks to be</i> <i> a phone operator.</i> You're sure about this?
(sighs) C...I'm not sure what was in that syringe, (recording stops) but it sent her into cardiac arrest.
And it seems like the guy's got a history of this.
BOBBY: It's not that I don't believe you guys, but these are huge accusations.
Do you think there's a way we can prove it?
Claudette's autopsy. The toxicology report is still pending. If we can get it expedited, we can see if there was anything in her blood that shouldn't have been there.
You think this is some kind of angel of mercy killing?
Putting people out of their supposed misery?
I think it's more complicated than that.
This guy's bringing people to the point of death and then using his skills to bring them back.
Whe-When he was a kid, he...
he got to play the hero.
Now he wants to play God.
(sighs) <i> TAYLOR:</i> <i> No, I am telling you,</i> <i> this is big.</i> I, um...
Yeah, just, um...just take a look at the file and see what you can find out.
That'd be great. Thanks, bye.
Hey, uh, what, uh, what are you doing?
Work stuff.
Really?
Buck, it's fascinating.
It's terrifying.
You-you know you can't run this story, right?
You can't blame me for wanting to.
We don't even know if it's true.
And if it is, you can't tell it 'cause Jonah will know we're onto him.
That's gonna put people in harm's way.
They're already in harm's way.
How many calls do you think he's going to respond to between now and whenever they stop him?
Hen said she was gonna go to Bobby.
Bobby will do something.
I can do something.
No, you can't.
Off the record, remember?
Yeah.
Promise me.
I promise.
I won't run the story.
RAMON: It's been much longer than five minutes. I feel fine.
Strong, right?
(music playing in distance) Yeah.
I had one myself.
Not a heart attack, but a panic attack.
Ended up in the E. R.
Why didn't you tell us?
Pretty sure you know the answer to that question.
You didn't want to...seem weak, either.
I spent my whole life trying not to be like you.
All these years, I, uh...I tried to...set a good example for you.
Maybe... aybe it was the wrong one, I don't know.
But I never understood why you were so angry with me.
I-I...why it always felt like you were punishing me.
Think I was punishing myself more.
But I'm tired of being that guy.
I'm going to be better.
For Christopher.
Mm.
For myself.
Maybe we can...we can both be better.
I don't want to miss out on any more of my son's life.
I'd like that.
(pats hand) All right, thanks.
Chim leave?
HEN: Yeah, he had to go home.
Maddie was dropping off Jee-Yun.
ATHENA: Uh, Bobby, wh-what did the chief say?
They've opened an investigation into Claudette's death.
Jonah's been put on light duty pending the results.
(sighs) That's a relief.
Thanks, Bobby.
Yeah.
Hen, be careful.
If Jonah is who you think he is, he won't take kindly to being exposed.
<i> (ringtone plays)</i> <i> HEN:</i> <i> Hello?</i>
<i>JONAH:</i> <i> I heard you've been</i> <i> asking people about me.</i>
Jonah?
Got the weirdest call.
<i> They've opened</i> <i> an investigation</i> <i> into what happened</i> <i> to that dispatcher.</i> Did you file a complaint against me, Henrietta?
Jonah, I don't-I don't know what you think is going on...
<i> I think you never</i> <i>gave me a chance, Hen.</i> <i>To prove myself.</i> <i>To show you</i> <i>what I'm capable of.</i> But, hey, I'm not a guy who gives up easy.
<i> So I'm gonna do that now.</i> I'm gonna show you.
(hangs up) (ringtone playing) Hey, baby, I was just about to call you.
<i> HEN:</i> <i> Get out of the house.</i> <i> Don't pack a bag.</i> Just take Ma and Denny and go over to Bobby and Athena's.
What?
K-Karen, please.
Uh, Denny, come here.
Uh, your mom's not here, she's out with Clive.
Okay, call her as soon as we get off the phone and tell her do not come home.
What's going on?
Uh, put your shoes on, and, uh, <i> and get your backpack,</i> <i> and we're going out.</i> Now? Where?
Yes. I'll explain in the car.
Hen, tell me what's going on.
Jonah called. He knows that I turned him in, and I'm just, <i> I'm just worried</i> <i> he's gonna do something.</i> What, you think he'd come here? Why? What did he say?
He said that I didn't give him a chance <i> and-and that</i> <i> he was gonna show me.</i> Sounded like some kind of jilted lover or something.
<i> He sounded jealous.</i> Well, this doesn't make any sense.
<i> Hen.</i> I'm not the one Jonah would be jealous of.
Chimney?
Chimney?
(phone clicks) (texting) Aah! No...
(grunts) (monitor beeping steadily) Aah!
No...
(Hen grunts) (slurping) (distant): Ah.
Hey there.
Glad you could join us.
(normal volume): You were out slightly longer than I expected.
I guess I was just a little too generous with the propofol.
(Hen grunts softly) I'll try to be more careful next time.
Why are you doing this, Jonah?
I guess the easiest answer is because I can.
You can get anything you want on the Internet these days.
Medical equipment.
Drugs.
The real answer is...you gave me no choice.
Snooping around, checking up on me?
We're supposed to be on the same team, Henrietta.
We're definitely not on the same team.
Oh, I think we are.
Now, you and this guy? Eh.
HEN: We don't put our patients' lives in danger just for our own ego.
You put your hand inside someone's chest, for Pete's sake.
If that's not ego, I don't know what is.
The patient would have died if I hadn't...
One sec.
HEN: No, J-Jonah, please.
No...
Relax.
No...No, Jonah.
It's just a little adenosine.
You're stopping his heart.
Don't worry, I'll get it back.
Nothing some epinephrine can't fix.
(Hen gasping) (monitor flatlines) No, no!
Please, no.
Oh, God. No!
Guess we got to shock.
(whirrs) Oh! Come on. Come on, Chim, come on.
(whoops) There's nothing like it, right?
The rush of watching someone walk right up to death's door and snatching them right back?
It's like being God.
We are not God!
Aren't we?
Okay, excited to see Daddy?
Hey, Chim, we're here.
Chim?
(phone vibrating, ringtone playing) Okay.
(vibrating, ringtone continue in distance) (grunts) Karen?
<i> Maddie? Where's Chimney?</i> I-I don't know. I...just brought Jee here, but he's not here.
<i> But his phone is.</i> Is Hen with you?
Wait, is she supposed to be? <i> Well, she was afraid</i> Chimney might be in danger, so she went to the apartment to check on him.
Why-why would he be in danger?
<i> Well, there's this paramedic</i> <i>that was working for a few weeks</i> <i> with Hen at the 118.</i> Um, I have to go.
What? <i> Yeah,</i> I-I need to get Jee out of here and call 911.
Do you think she's right?
Chimney's in danger?
<i> I don't know,</i> <i> I think they both are.</i> HEN (crying): Jonah, listen.
Your beef is with me, okay?
Plea-Please let Chimney go.
Please.
Okay.
(breathing shakily) What...
No, no, no, no. Jonah, Jonah.
Jonah, please.
No, plea-please, please, Jonah. Please.
Oh, I thought you wanted me to let him go.
(struggling) My bad.
Let's-let's get him back.
(defibrillator humming) Hmm.
(grunts) HEN: Chimney.
(sobbing): Come on, Chimney.
I've got nothing.
(cries out) Let's give it a go again.
(sobbing) Clear.
(Hen exclaims) Chimney.
(Hen sobbing) (Jonah sighs) (monitor beeping) (Jonah chuckles) I really don't know what you see in this guy.
(groans) You need a partner who's more your speed.
(Jonah sighs) You...
You really think you're my speed?
You're sloppy.
I'm not sloppy, don't say that.
HEN: Even if I wanted to do some of the horrible things, horrible things that you did, you really think I would have let myself get caught?
(scoffs) You killed people.
It wasn't on purpose.
They weren't supposed to die.
I was gonna save 'em.
I'm a hero.
You might have been.
Once, when you were a child.
But not now.
All you are is a murderer now!
(struggling) No, I'm not.
Then why is Chimney not breathing?
(monitor beeping rapidly) (Chimney grunts) (Hen gasping) (groaning) Chim.
Easy, easy, easy.
(groaning) Easy, Chim, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy...
(Chimney sighs) Easy, Chim, easy.
Easy, take it easy.
(grunting) (panting) (stammering): Careful, Chim.
Careful... (exclaims) Are you okay?
CHIMNEY: Not even...
(groaning) Okay, come on, buddy, come on.
(groaning) Okay.
All right, buddy.
Good idea with the defibrillator.
You saved us.
It was...a team effort.
(Hen sobbing) (sirens wailing) RAVI: Lucy.
They're saying it was Hen and Chimney, a-and they were attacked.
What? By who?
ATHENA: Slow down, slow down.
BOBBY: We need to get in there.
We need to get in there.
This is a crime scene.
Hey, Cap.
LUCY: Wait, Cap!
Bobby.
BOBBY: You son of a bitch, I trusted you.
(grunts) (overlapping chatter) Enough. He's not worth any more of your time.
Nice punch.
Thank God you guys are alive.
I am so sorry about what happened to you.
I'm just glad he got caught, and in the act.
Hopefully this evidence will be more concrete than what we were working with earlier.
ATHENA: With this evidence, that man will be going away for the rest of his life.
He won't ever hurt anybody ever again.
CHIMNEY: Then it was worth it.
How were you guys able to get the police here so fast?
I thought we were out here on our own.
Karen called, told us everything she knew.
You know, you're a lucky woman to have a wife like that.
Don't I know it.
We're gonna contact Karen and Maddie, let 'em know what hospital they're taking you to, and we'll be right behind you.
We're good, Cap.
I got him.
Hey, uh... are you okay?
Yeah, we're fine.
They cleared the apartment, they took my statement, they're gonna leave a few guys behind for the night.
But...isn't Jonah in custody?
They were worried about press showing up or something.
Anyway, I really need to get to the hospital and just make sure that he's okay.
Yeah.
I mean, it seems like he's okay.
You know, making jokes and being Chimney, but...
Are you okay with her for a few hours?
Yeah. Come on, me and Jee will have a little slumber party.
(Jee-Yun babbles) Is that him?
Uh, well...
Turn the volume up?
Yeah.
<i> Sources close to the case say</i> <i> Firefighter/Paramedic Greenway</i> <i> had multiple suspicious</i> <i> incidents in the field.</i> They have his name and personnel photo already?
How did she get it so fast?
<i> ...even several deaths.</i> Good question.
<i> The LAFD has declined comment</i> <i>at this time,</i> <i>but we will continue</i> <i> to keep you updated</i> <i> as this story evolves.</i> Back to you, Jim.
<i> TAYLOR (on recording):</i> <i>This is Taylor. Leave a message.</i>
Taylor. What did you do?
I don't think I need to tell you how lucky you are.
No, but I'd love to hear that I'm okay and that you're sending me home.
Your heart stopped and you were shocked back to life -- twice.
We're keeping you overnight for observation, Mr. Han.
Doc, I feel okay, really.
Great. But, to make sure you stay that way, we got to make sure you don't have arrhythmias or any other permanent damage.
You'll spend the night on the cardiac floor, then we'll send you home with a Holter monitor for a couple days.
Awesome. Can't wait.
HEN: Chim, she's right.
You can never be too safe.
Especially after what he did to you.
DR. SALAZAR: I'm glad you feel that way, 'cause we're keeping you, too.
Why? My heart is fine.
We need to do a full workup and a tox screen, make sure he didn't inject you with anything else besides propofol.
The nurse should be here soon.
(sighs) Got to say, I didn't see our victory lap going down like this.
KAREN: Oh, my God.
Hen.
Ooh, hey, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you sure?
What did he do to you?
I'm okay.
Chimney took the brunt of it.
KAREN: Oh, God, Chim.
I'm fine, we're both fine.
Doc said we're both gonna be okay.
KAREN: God, the whole way over here, I just...I was mentally preparing myself for the worst-case scenario.
(voice quavering): I didn't know where you were, or if you'd even make it out alive.
What would I tell Denny? Your mother?
It's okay.
(Karen shudders) Everything's fine.
(sighs) He can never hurt anybody again.
(Athena sighs deeply) Should I get you a steak, too? (chuckles) Is that just for black eyes?
Ice will be just fine, thank you.
You know, I'm not sure I've ever seen you snap like that.
Well, you don't remember.
When you were attacked at the storage unit?
(Athena sighs) I thought about doing something that night.
Then I saw you and realized you needed me more.
(chuckles) Mm.
My hero.
Hitting Jonah, probably not the most heroic of actions.
I certainly let my emotions get the better of me.
Oh?
Just couldn't help myself.
Yeah, well, it's hard seeing the people you love hurting like that.
Especially when you feel responsible for it.
I let that man into my house.
This isn't your fault.
I let that man into my house.
(indistinct P. A. announcement) (whispering): Hey.
I'm breaking out of this joint.
Are you with me?
I'm all in, ride or die.
Just unhook me and help me find my pants.
What?
You almost did die.
I'm sorry for roping you into all of this, Chim.
The only reason he went after you is because of me.
I wish I had never gotten you involved.
Come on, now, that's not how we do it.
You jump, I jump.
Or something like that.
Think I was gonna let you go after that creep by yourself?
I knew you'd have my back and there'd be no stopping you.
Exactly.
So what are we even talking about here?
You know, I never liked him.
Jonah, I mean.
Not much of a fan myself.
(slurps) Everyone thought I was crazy, that I was being too hard on him because he wasn't you. But you...you never flinched.
You were on board from the start, ready to go to battle with me, even...even when I had no proof, no idea if I was even right.
You're always right.
That's kind of our schtick.
You're the genius, I'm the comic relief.
(slurps) You're so much more than that.
(voice breaking): You're the best friend that I've ever had, Chim.
And I can't imagine my life without you.
(sets juice pack down) And you're never gonna have to.
@@@@@@
* Welcome-mm-mm-mm...
to the beginning.
As the snake sheds its skin, the butterfly emerges from the cocoon, here at the Anant Ka Aashram, so, too, will you be reborn and emerge fresh from this spiritual journey.
Let us begin our therapeutic session by drinking the ceremonial tea of renewal and rebirth.
KATHY: You said "rebirth." There's not placenta or anything in this, is there?
Wait, that's not a thing, is it?
Oh, a lady from my walking group used to blend her placenta in a smoothie.
Okay, but that's not in the tea, right?
Of course not.
Um, so what is?
Ah, it's an ancient mystic's recipe.
Yeah, that's not an answer.
Um, black, green, chai, oolong teas mixed with matcha, dried mushroom caps, ginger and...
I'm-I'm sorry, did you just say mushrooms?
As in hallucinogenic narcotics?
Is that bad? This is California.
It's a felony!
Is it?
REGGIE: Yeah.
You just roofied us.
Okay.
* I like to dream * Hey!
* Yes, yes * * Right between the sound machine... * (group shouting angrily) KATHY: He's getting away.
Ah, okay, should've gone to real estate school.
Oh, boy.
Okay. Get in there.
We almost got him.
* Well, you don't know what we can find... * Siri... call 911.
Siri, call 911.
Oh, Buddha.
(screams) (siren wailing) Can someone tell me what happened?
We unleashed our primal selves. (chortles) These people appear to be hallucinating.
MAN: Hi.
How would you know?
You looked like this when you were dosed.
No, I didn't.
(scoffs) Whatever.
He dosed us, man, and then dude went over.
Over where?
Uh...
Ortiz, make sure they stay away from the edge.
(exhales) HEN: Sir!
Are you hurt?
(Eugene shuddering) I, uh, I think I sprained my ankle on the way down.
We're gonna come down and get you.
Oh, thank God.
Okay, everybody, ladder rescue. Hen, Chim, prep a basket.
Buck, Ravi, start extending that ladder over the edge of the cliff.
Uh, Cap, I-I was gonna harness up.
I'm gonna go down to get him. Donato, you're with me.
Yeah, copy that, Cap.
You riding the ropes, Cap?
What, did I stutter? Let's move!
(brakes squeak) Go.
BOBBY: You set?
Set.
All right, let's go.
All right, Eugene, you hang tight. We're almost there.
Oh, thank God. Whoa.
All right, Ravi, basket's ready as soon as Cap is.
(rumbling) Wait, did you feel that? Was that a quake?
Guys, what the hell was that?
The cliff's going.
That didn't feel right, Cap.
Cap, Lucy, unhook now. The cliff's coming down, and it's taking the ladder with it.
CHIMNEY: Everybody fall back!
BOBBY: All right, Lucy, unhook.
Get down!
Cap!
(exhales) That-That-That's bad, right?
Yeah, Eugene.
That's bad.
NEWSMAN: Quite the predicament for these first responders.
Turns out they needed some second responders.
Must we keep reliving this?
It's on every channel.
Then shut it off.
... LAFD paramedic Jonah Greenway.
Our Taylor Kelly has a fresh report on that coming up next.
BOBBY: This wasn't a punishment, Buck.
Come on, Cap.
I-I know everyone is mad about Taylor's story.
No one is mad.
Chief Alonzo seemed pretty mad when he was interrogating me.
This was a hearing about Jonah, Buck. Not an interrogation.
No, the interrogation came after the hearing in his office.
He wanted to know all these things about Taylor.
You know, wh-where does she get her information?
Who are her sources?
Am I one of them?
They were embarrassed.
It would have been better for the department if they could have released this story themselves, controlled the narrative a little bit.
I think they would have liked a heads-up. That's all.
Yeah, well, they aren't the only ones.
She promised me, Cap.
She promised me she wouldn't do the story, and I believed her.
I'm sorry I let you down.
This wasn't your fault, Buck.
You know, I can't even blame Taylor for all this.
She's a reporter.
She wasn't the one running around, playing God right under my nose.
Cap, you couldn't have known.
I should have!
It's my job.
Sorry, kid.
EDDIE: He said that?
He did.
Well, you know how he is.
He takes responsibility for everything.
That's his way.
Probably why he makes such a good captain.
Taking responsibility for something he didn't do wrong?
(inhales) It's a bad road to go down.
You lose sight of things, of who you are.
I just... I-I wish I could...
Fix it? (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm the guy that always wants to fix everything.
Hey, comes in handy when you have a bunch of holes in your wall.
Also sounded like maybe you needed a reason to get out of the house.
Uh, yeah.
Taylor and I are still avoiding each other.
Mm.
I-I know we-we have to talk.
I still feel so angry.
Feel like whatever I say is just gonna be mean.
You can't put it off forever.
You keep that anger and resentment bottled up?
Eventually you snap.
(Bobby grunts) (sighs) Mom? Bobby?
(grunts) Damn it.
Yeah?
(exhales) Hey.
Oh, no, what happened?
Uh, I was just cleaning up before dinner, and I somehow managed to break a glass.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a scratch.
Uh, I tell you what, let me just clean this up, and...
Oh, no.
I got it. You clean that cut and maybe change your shirt.
Oh, yeah.
That's probably not the most appetizing thing for your celebration dinner.
What do you mean, "celebration"?
Mom and Harry are about to walk through that door with a congratulatory "you're going to college" balloon arrangement, aren't they?
There might be some USC sweatshirts involved, as well.
Okay.
Tell you what, I'm gonna go change before they get back.
Yeah. So much for my surprise announcement.
(whispers): Oh, my gosh.
(glass crunches) You were right. Fish tacos here are pretty damn good.
Though still probably not as good as Andrea's.
Andrea's.
(Chimney chuckles softly) So, I, I just wanted us to talk through some stuff without our tiny human interrupting.
(music playing faintly) I'm okay with it.
If you feel you're ready, then I support you completely.
Really?
Yeah.
I know it didn't work out with us, but...
I still want you to be happy, so if you think it's time...
What do you think that I think we're ready for?
Dating. Other people.
Going back to work.
That's what I was gonna talk to you about.
Oh, so not dating?
Well, I mean, if you're ready to start dating...
No. No, I'm not... No. I mean, I'm-I'm-I'm...
(chuckles): Can we start this conversation over, please?
(chuckles) Okay. I would like to go back to work.
At the call center. And I know that it's gonna complicate the schedule that we've already worked out, and we'll take a hit financially with day care, but...
You miss helping people.
I guess I didn't realize how much that place really mattered to me until I saw it burning on television.
I never should have walked away.
They'd be glad just to have you back.
(door opens) CHIMNEY: Hey.
Lunch clearly went well.
You're in a much better mood than when you left.
I'm guessing the talk with Maddie was good.
(exhales) She wasn't asking for permission to date anyone.
You were wrong about that one, little brother.
That is not how I remember the conversation going.
You were the one who was spiraling.
I believe I told you to chill.
I do not spiral.
Yeah, well, maybe you would if you took one of these.
What is...
Career aptitude test.
ALBERT: Now that I've quit the fire department, I'm gonna have to start over.
Won't be following in your footsteps.
Definitely won't be following in Father's, so...
(chuckles) Guess I have to find other footsteps.
CHIMNEY: Wow. Archaeologist.
Librarian. Sociologist.
Trial lawyer?
You don't think I'd make a good lawyer?
I don't know. I don't see it.
(chuckles) There you go. That's you.
What?
Cosmetologist.
(music playing faintly) DEENA: Dontrell.
Deena. Hey. What brings you in?
Without an appointment.
Something's wrong. Ever since you put in these extensions last week, I've had these headaches.
Oh, I warned you that might happen.
It's gonna be a little tight at first, but it'll slowly loosen up. Just give it some time, okay?
This isn't tight. It's crippling pain.
Hey, being pretty ain't pretty.
DEENA: I want you to take them out now.
Start over and do it right this time.
Deena, don't you think you're being a little overdramatic?
I have a one-star review, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Raquel, sweetie, why don't you give us a minute?
Why don't you try a espresso from over there?
Okay.
Have a seat.
(Deena sighs) It hurts the most in the back, right in the crown.
This isn't cool, Deena.
I'm not a fan of doing my work twice.
You should have done it right the first time.
Oh, my God.
DEENA: What?
Oh, my gosh.
HEN: BP's a little low, but his heart sounds good.
Pupils are equal and reactive, so we can rule out any sort of TBI or hematoma.
(Dontrell whimpers) CHIMNEY: Easy.
You got a pretty nasty bump on your head. You're gonna...
His head?!
What about mine?
Ma'am, I'm afraid your stylist is out of commission for the day. You're gonna have to find somebody else to deal with your hair emergency.
Then you have to help me, okay? My head, it's throbbing.
Ever since he put these extensions in a few days ago, I've had these blinding headaches.
You keep scissors in that thing, right? Can you cut it out?
HEN: Uh...
BOBBY: Uh, Hen, can you come and take a look at this?
DEENA: What?
Uh, just-just hold still.
Okay.
Uh...
Hen, aren't those...?
HEN: Whoa.
Maggots.
(screams) You did this to me!
(gasping) Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
What's your name?
Deena.
HEN: Okay, Deena, have a seat.
Okay? I'm Hen.
Okay? I can't help you unless you calm down. Take a deep breath.
(gasping) Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine.
All right. You might need these. Here.
HEN: Yeah.
Hold the light while I try to cut one of these out.
Ugh.
(Deena whimpers) HEN: Yep. Live larva.
(Deena groans) It's mostly superficial.
No sign of systemic parasitic infection.
Ugh.
But it's definitely an infestation.
Oh, God, I think I'm gonna be sick.
HEN: You're gonna be okay, all right?
We're gonna get you to the hospital, and they're gonna take good care of you.
BOBBY: Okay, let's clean her up as best we can, get-get her ready for transport.
We should try to get 'em out now.
Otherwise, they're gonna remove them surgically, shave her head.
Shave my head? I can't walk around with a shaved head.
(gasping) I don't have your bone structure.
I could never pull it off.
Do you mind telling me how the hell this could happen?
I-I have no idea.
Well, you had to get the hair from somewhere, right?
Well, yeah.
I-I-I-I mean, I-I had to...
And?
You don't understand.
Like, it's so hard finding real human hair right now.
Everything's back-ordered. The supply chain's all messed up.
I was gonna lose clients.
Where did you get the hair?
(siren wails) Can I help you, Officer?
You're Gregory Abewell of Abewell Mortuary?
Yes.
I-Is there a problem?
We need to have a talk, Mr. Abewell.
About what?
(sighs) HEN: I'd heard about folks illegally harvesting tissue and bones from dead people, but hair?
Hmm. That's why I stick to au naturel.
(chuckles softly) Half the time, you don't know what people trying to sell you.
CLIVE: And I am more than fine with the authentic Antonia.
That poor woman must have spent hundreds of dollars to get her hair done only to end up in the hospital.
Not to mention a lifetime of nightmares.
Do they lay eggs or something in your head?
Uh...
Wait, could they burrow into your brain?
Okay, I think we need a new topic of conversation.
(chuckles) Well, Clive and I have some news.
I have asked your mother to do me the honor of becoming my wife.
And I said yes.
Ma! That's amazing.
We are so happy for you two.
DENNY: Congratulations, Grammy.
Do I get to call you Grandpa now?
You can call me whatever you like.
(chuckles) HEN: I-I can't believe you're gonna make it official.
I kind of thought that you had given up on that entire institution.
TONI: Well, it turns out not all marriages are fiery hellscapes.
(Karen chuckles) Yours seems to be doing okay.
HEN: So, what are you thinking?
Family trip to Vegas could be fun.
Actually, we were hoping to do it here.
Maybe in the backyard?
O-Our backyard?
TONI: Yeah.
Make it a real wedding, especially since it's Clive's first time.
CLIVE: First and last.
Mwah.
TONI: So, you guys okay with that?
Ma, I think it would...
(silverware clangs) (chair scoots) What was that?
She didn't come to our wedding, Hen. The one we had right here in the same backyard she wants to get married in.
She apologized. We forgave her.
(Karen sighs) Didn't we?
I-I love Toni. I do.
And having her here has changed our family in the best way, but...
Oh, the thought of, of her getting married here just...
Karen, I can't believe you're still bothered by this.
Yes, my mother didn't come to our wedding.
But I've found a way to let it go.
It was still a beautiful day.
You didn't see the look on your face.
You met me at the altar and turned to see if she was there.
And there was an empty chair.
And I watched your heart break before we even said "I do." It wasn't the happiest day of our life, Hen.
But it was still a pretty damn good one.
Hmm?
Yeah. It was. (chuckles) Listen, if you don't want them to get married here, it's okay.
But I need you to talk to her.
I don't want this to become a thing.
I'll fix it.
(crying): I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
Of course you can have your wedding here.
MADDIE: (sighs) This is... interesting.
Everybody hates it.
(chuckles) It was supposed to be some new communal workspace.
Opened right before the pandemic and closed two months later.
Well, at least you have buzzword salad on the walls.
(Josh sighs) It's just temporary until the new space is ready for us.
And when's that gonna be?
Mid-September, I think?
Welcome back, Maddie.
There's doughnuts in the breakroom.
Oh, I'm good, but it's nice to see you.
Sir, I understand your car being towed feels like an emergency...
We're sharing the breakroom with the accounting firm next door.
The good news is, they always have doughnuts.
Bad news is...
They always have doughnuts.
Maddie, welcome back.
(both chuckle) MAY: Sir, I could just send the police.
That's what I thought. Have a great day.
(Maddie exhales) You got this.
Do I? Because I thought I was coming back to work, and now it feels like I'm starting over.
JOSH: The space may have changed.
The job hasn't. You're gonna be great.
Okay.
(sighs) (beeps) 911.
What's your emergency?
(phone chimes) Ah! Maddie took her first call.
No one died.
RAVI: That's great news.
Both parts.
What?
No, nothing.
(phone vibrates) Oh, hey. I just got a text from my sister about her first call.
I guess we can all see Chimney still comes first.
You know, this is a sign. I-I really think...
Oh, is this the part of our day where we share our opinions about each other's relationships?
(chuckles) 'Cause I have a few choice words about your...
BUCK: Okay, okay.
Hey, Cap. I heard that May's leaving the call center for college?
BOBBY: Yeah.
Wow. You and your wife must be really happy about that.
Well, relieved more than anything.
I-I think it'll be good for her to get away from the emergencies, the tragedies.
I just want to say one...
Hey, is, uh, May gonna do anything over the summer?
Uh, she didn't get to do that when she graduated, right?
BOBBY: Well, she's going to Miami with her brother Harry.
And then she's gonna go visit Athena's parents.
They're gonna have a few weeks together before school starts.
Oh. She's gonna miss the wedding.
Mom doesn't have a lot of friends left in the area.
I think Karen was hoping to draft some people to fill in that side of the aisle.
How did Karen go from hard no to planning the wedding?
Overcompensating for massive amounts of guilt.
(chuckles) I think it's sweet that Karen was defending you.
I mean, isn't that what we all want in a partner?
Knowing that they have your back?
Yeah. Until they stick a knife in it.
You really need to talk to her.
I think maybe I'm just gonna hope it works itself out.
Just do us all a favor. Stay away from the tequila until you've made a rational decision about that situation.
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
We like Lucy. So next time you go kissing on her again, you're the one who has to leave.
(mouths) When did you two kiss?
Two months ago.
I feel like I am missing warning signs left and right.
Bobby, there are some things that subordinates do not tell captains.
Or sergeants.
I still should have known.
But the fact that you haven't noticed means that it hasn't been a problem, right?
I guess.
(scoffs softly) But you're in your own head about it.
Like everything else.
You know, I'm kind of jealous of May and Harry.
When was the last time we had a vacation?
What, just us together?
Exactly.
And we have had a year.
What would you say to us taking the honeymoon that we never had?
I feel like there's so much happening right now. I don't...
I just need some time to think about it.
Cole, it's time.
Yeah, okay, baby.
Baby. Hospital. Now.
Baby. Come on. Let's go.
Baby.
Okay. Okay. All right.
Let's... (groaning) COLE: All right, all right. Okay.
AMARI: Okay.
COLE: We got this. We got this.
AMARI: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(groans, exhales) Okay. Okay.
All right.
Shoes.
Shoes. Shoes. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Shoes. Yes, yes.
Okay. Okay, okay.
We're good. We're good.
Okay.
We got it. Get that foot in there.
We're good. Let's just...
Doing amazing. We're doing amazing.
Yes. Got it. Okay.
(exhales) Okay.
All right, let me grab the bag.
(Amari breathing deeply) All right, charger. Okay.
(Amari groans) Okay, okay, okay, okay. So, I got laptop. Charger.
Yes.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Toothpaste.
Baby bag.
Yeah.
Think I remembered everything.
Yes.
You always do. Let's go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Okay.
You doing okay?
Good? All right.
All good.
Okay.
Okay.
(grunts, exhales) Okay. Yeah.
(both exhale) All right.
(engine starts) (Amari gasps) MADDIE: Hello?
Are you there?
Hello?
Is anyone there? Are you okay?
Um, there's been an accident.
Are you injured?
COLE: I don't... I think...
I think s-something bad happened.
I need you to stay on the line with me, sir.
I'm here.
Okay.
(typing) Help is on the way.
(siren wailing) Buck, Lucy, saws and Jaws.
MADDIE: 118, be advised, driver is semiconscious.
We've lost contact.
Dispatch, I've also got a passenger.
A pregnant woman.
Copy that. Driver did not report it.
Sending additional ambulance.
BOBBY: Okay, Hen, you check on Mom.
Chimney, you've got Dad.
Cap, I-I need a way in.
All right, right here.
(grunts) How you doing in here?
Cole.
CHIMNEY: Cap, he's wedged in there pretty tight.
It's gonna take some time to get him out.
HEN: I can't get her out without getting him out, and I need to get her out now.
How many weeks are you?
AMARI: Um, 38.
We were on our way to...
Were you in labor before the accident?
(Amari panting) CHIMNEY: Hey, Cole.
You've been in an accident. You took quite a hit.
Let me just check your vitals.
Cap, one pupil is less reactive. We got to get him out of here.
Copy that.
How's Mom and baby?
(grunts) Angle's bad.
I can't get a heartbeat.
Oh, God.
It doesn't mean there isn't one.
BOBBY: Okay, everybody, clear the vehicle. Let's cut 'em out.
(whirring) (siren wailing) Is the baby okay?
Please tell me he's okay.
No other pain besides the contractions?
No.
So, we're doing this again?
How come we're doing it again?
CHIMNEY: Uh, I just wanted an update.
Hey, Cap, can you call ahead and set up a TBI protocol?
What does that mean?
Water was clear. No meconium.
From what I can tell, you're eight centimeters and almost fully effaced.
Can you tell me your name again, sir?
So, we're doing that again, too?
It's Cole.
CHIMNEY: That's right.
Now, can you tell me what year it is, Cole?
COLE: Course I can.
It's two thousand...
Uh, two thousand...
Sorry.
There it is.
(exhales) The heartbeat is strong.
You're gonna have this baby soon, Amari.
But not in this ambulance.
What about Cole?
CHIMNEY: Can you tell me who the president is?
COLE: President?
It's...
It's that old guy. Um...
It's okay.
You're just foggy from the head trauma.
We need to keep you alert and awake.
Believe me, having your first child will definitely do that for you.
I'm having a kid?
Is he all right?
We're bringing your husband in for further observation.
Oh, Cole! Cole.
I called my sister. She's on the way.
She's gonna record everything so you don't have to miss it.
Miss what?
Cole?
Do I know you?
I don't... I don't know her. Do I know her?
(Amari panting) Okay.
Try to relax.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all right.
* Said my name * * So quietly... * So, how much time do you think he lost?
At least six or seven years.
Hen said with this type of amnesia, there's a-a chance his memories might come back.
Or there'll just be a big black hole in the middle of his life.
You remember that movie?
The woman, she-she wakes up every morning, and her brain resets to a year ago, so anything she does today, she won't remember tomorrow.
Yeah, that was anterograde amnesia.
Works a little differently.
It still sounds like a nightmare.
You know, starting over every day.
Always doing the same thing, making the same mistakes.
Never having a chance to learn or make a different decision.
Like a hamster on a wheel.
It was a comedy.
I think it's supposed to be romantic.
You know, the idea that the guy would work hard every day, making her fall in love with him over and over again.
So every day is the best day ever.
Is that really love?
Right? Sh-Shouldn't it be when you're at your worst, they're at their worst, you have every reason to give up, and you still decide you want to try again?
I guess it is.
* After all. * (monitor beeping steadily) COLE: So, the baby's okay?
Eight pounds, one ounce.
They wouldn't let me bring him.
(exhales) (crying): I'm sorry.
I wish...
Hey. Hey.
It's all right.
It's not.
I had this whole life, and I don't remember it.
I don't remember you or our son.
And what if I never remember?
What if...
Then we start over.
How?
I'm gonna tell you a story.
What kind of story?
A love story.
("If I Could Build My Whole World Around You" playing) (metal clinks) (knock on door) * Oh, if I could build my whole world... * Hi.
Hello.
Did you order roti, sticky rice, grilled pork, and coconut soup?
I know, it's a lot. (chuckles) (chuckles) Wait, are you the delivery guy?
I'm your neighbor.
Uh, delivery guy left it on my doorstep and ran.
I guess he was late for the next one.
Oh.
Sorry about that. (chuckles) Um, thank you for carrying it the last few yards.
I'm Cole, by the way. Welcome to the neighborhood.
Amari. Uh...
(chuckles) Yeah.
(chuckles) Oh, let me get that.
Delivery guy and a doorman.
(chuckles) So, are you, uh, new to the area?

All good.
(Amari exhales) * And that would be all right * * Oh, yeah * * If I could just * * Build my world, baby * * If I could build it, build it * * All around you * * And that would be all right. * Buck?
You home?
(exhales) Well, I guess we've moved past the avoidance stage?
BUCK: I think we can both admit it was starting to get ridiculous.
I'm sorry you're still upset about the story.
You're not sorry for what you did, though.
The story was gonna come out regardless.
If I hadn't have broken it, someone else would have.
Y-You couldn't have called me first?
No, you-you just...
You figured I'd be fine. I'd get over it.
Buck, I wasn't trying to hurt you or anyone else.
I was just trying to get the truth out there.
A truth the public has every right to know.
This is literally our first argument all over again.
Which is why we shouldn't be having it.
You knew who I was when we started dating.
I guess I thought I could learn to live with it.
I don't want to be something you have to learn to live with.
And I don't want to keep on making the same mistakes. (sniffles) I need things to be different, Taylor.
Okay.
I'm willing to try that.
Clean slate.
Yeah.
Just not together.
EDDIE: May, you got a sec?
Hey. I heard you hit a million followers.
Oh, yeah.
That's what happens when a ladder truck goes off a cliff.
Two days of tweets about traffic collisions and trash fires should take care of that.
Yeah.
What do you need?
How's Bobby doing?
Why would you ask me that?
Probably the same reason you're looking at me like that.
The other night, I went to the house to tell them that I'd decided on going back to college, but when I got there, it was weird.
He had just dropped a glass and cut his hand.
Why was that weird?
Because the way he acted when I came in.
Felt like I was interrupting more than just a broken glass.
ATHENA: Hey, babe. What's up?
I just went out to pick up some basics we were running low on.
How's your shift?
Mm, nothing much, but I'm just getting started.
How are you doing?
I'm good. Gonna have an early dinner and call it a night.
All right.
Good to hear.
(knock on door) Uh, somebody's at the door, so-so I got to run.
All right.
See you in the morning.
Okay. Love you. Bye.
Eddie.
Bobby.
Promise I don't have any transfer requests in my hand.
(chuckles) All right, then you can come in.
All right.
(door closes) Can't stay for long.
I need to pick up Christopher.
But, um...
I wanted to say...
Jonah wasn't your fault.
Eddie.
No, look, I spent the last few months trying to put away a lot of things from the past and move on.
What I've learned is, you can't carry someone else's weight.
It'll take you under.
I'm the captain.
My responsibility...
Is your team.
But he was on the 118 for, what, a-a few weeks?
You barely knew him.
You think you missed something?
All the other cities, other houses.
Everybody missed something.
This happened on my watch.
He killed Claudette and who knows how many others.
Because he thought he was a god.
But he's not.
Neither are you.
You're not all-knowing and all-seeing, Bobby.
You're just a good man.
I'm not.
I am not.
You saved my life.
And my son's.
So, whatever responsibility you take for Jonah, you make sure you take some credit for me.
You earned it.
(sighs) I got to go.
Hey, are you sure you can't stay for dinner?
Oh, man, I'd love to, but Christopher got some friends over, and-and I don't want to leave Carla without backup.
Yeah, I got you.
Yeah.
Thanks for stopping by, Eddie.
I mean it.
Literally the least I could do, Bobby.
Thank you.
(door opens) (door closes) * * * (groans) Did you order enough linens for this one, too?
I ordered exactly what you told me to.
Thought you could use a hand.
Or a few hands.
What are you doing here?
Did you...?
No. No.
BUCK: Come on, Hen.
You know we weren't gonna miss this.
Miss what?
You should ask your mom.
Hi, Karen.
Go get a drink.
KAREN: Hey.
EDDIE: Yeah.
You're not getting married, Ma?
Clive and I can do it another time.
I have four dozen deviled eggs in the fridge.
There will be a wedding today.
TONI: There will.
Just not mine.
Ma...
TONI: Henrietta, let me say this.
I'm sorry I didn't come to your wedding.
I had my reasons, my excuses.
I didn't understand.
I wasn't ready.
I needed more time to catch up with the way the world was changing.
But the truth is, honey, I was just wrong.
It's okay, Toni.
TONI: No, it isn't.
I don't know how you found it in your heart to forgive me, but I'm grateful you did.
We all lost something that day.
I think today may be our chance to get it back.

Mom.
Excuse me!
Watch where you're going!
Mom, you seriously need to chill.
I will not chill.
After everything you've been through in the last year, I don't know how you could possibly think that being in a stadium filled with 50,000 people was a good idea.
It only holds 23 and a half. I checked.
Mom, what has this past year been about?
Okay? Me getting better.
So that I get to do all the normal things that everyone else gets to do without batting an eye.
EMPLOYEE: Order up.
This isn't normal.
It's reckless.
No, these are reckless.
And too much cheese isn't good for you either.
This isn't cheese. It's cheese-adjacent.

<i>BOBBY (over comm): Eddie, Chim,</i> <i>ladder's moving into position.</i> <i> Let's get that fire out.</i> (crowd screaming) Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.
I got possible visual on IED at the eastern concourse.
It's-it's-- It's not... it's not a bomb.
It's my heart.
Please...
... find my mom.
Dispatch, I got eyes on the alleged IED.
It's definitely not a bomb. Some kind of medical device.
She says it's for her heart.
I'm sending you a picture now.
Uh, that looks like a pneumatic pump for an artificial heart.
It sends air through the tubes to power an implant in her chest.
I don't think it's functioning. She just lost consciousness.
<i> Her pulse is barely there.</i> Must be damaged.
Should I start CPR?
No. The implant is made of hard plastic.
<i> Compressions will only</i> <i> jam it into her sternum.</i> <i> Do you see another backpack?</i> Another one?
She wouldn't go without a backup.
Someone else must have it.
(device beeps) I think her heart's shutting down.
How long do I have?
<i> If the heart is shutting down,</i> <i> minutes.</i> Fire's out, Cap. Swing us over to the cab.
All right, bring 'em on back.

Yes. I'm on my way to her right now.
Stay put here. Help is coming, okay?

Do you feel any pain in your abdomen, ma'am?
No. My daughter.
What about your daughter?
She's still inside.
I'm here. What do I do?
<i> MADDIE: Remove the broken pump</i> <i> from the backpack</i> <i> and unspool the clear tube.</i> <i> Disconnect them from the</i> <i>connectors around her waistline.</i> It should look like a plumbing fitting. <i> Okay.</i> Then attach the connectors to the new device.
<i> Once it's secure,</i> <i> put in the battery,</i> <i> and it should power up.</i> (beeps) Come on.

(exhales) Well, they say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing.
Hey, you're alive. (chuckles) You, too.
(chuckles) Hey, so, how they gonna get the rest of that thing down?
Not our problem.
Is she okay?
She's doing fine.
Mom?
You're gonna be okay. Okay, I'll see you there.
It's okay.
How was crowd control, Sergeant?
Got called in to do an emergency heart transplant instead.
(scoffs) Well, you win.
Eh, who's keeping score?
(both laugh) BOBBY: What did the doctor say?
<i> I'm definitely broken.</i> How'd you break your foot off-duty?
<i> HEN:</i> <i> Yeah, we thought you were</i> <i> going to that</i> <i> family reunion weekend.</i> Yeah. That's how I broke it.
We were playing football, I got shoved from behind, and I just rolled my ankle.
HEN AND CHIMNEY: Avulsion fracture of the fifth metatarsal.
<i> Yeah, what they said.</i> Happens a lot when you roll your ankle.
Wait, so-so, one of your brothers pushed you from behind?
My niece Delilah.
<i>She's seven and kind of vicious.</i> <i> She's my favorite.</i> So we probably won't see you for a few weeks, then?
<i> Doctor says between four</i> <i> and six weeks.</i> <i> I am really sorry, Cap.</i> <i> I hope I didn't ruin</i> <i> your honeymoon.</i> Don't worry about it, I'll find somebody else to cover.
You just let us know if you need anything.
All right, gang, let's get ready to turn it over to B-shift.
Uh, hey, hey, Cap.
Um, wh-what did Lucy mean about ruining your trip?
I was gonna have her fill in for me when I was gone.
Uh, you were gonna make Lucy interim captain?
She, she hasn't even been here that long.
Not the 118, but she's been a firefighter for almost ten years.
She's more than qualified.
Well, yeah, but o-other people here are also qualified.
Hey, I appreciate the vote of confidence, kid, but I don't need to pressure Cap into asking me.
I'd like to pressure him into not asking you.
BOBBY: Oh, you want to be interim captain again?
Because the last time you did it, I recall the words "never again." That was from the rest of us.
(laughs) Thanks, Cap. But never again.
It is nice to be asked, though.
So it doesn't bother you?
That Bobby didn't even consider either one of us for interim captain?
Not really. Just got back to the 118.
Clearly it's bothering you.
Listen, don't get me wrong, I think Lucy is whatever.
You know, she's great, but she's out.
You know, I think it's weird that he's struggling to pick a replacement when he has so many other excellent options right under his nose.
Like you?
It's like he's choosing not to see them and everything they have to offer.
Time. Aw, you'll win next time.
What are you offering?
Right now, Bobby's famous lasagna.
Six types of cheese, cooked to perfection.
Okay, very hot.
Don't use your hands.
It does look good.
Smells really good, too.
And it only took me three tries to get it right.
I'm not sure you get three tries on a job.
At least not without a significant body count.
I just want to know what these other candidates have that apparently I don't.
CHRISTOPHER: Buck, you don't even have a couch.
(Eddie laughs) Uh...
Boom!
... so what does that have to do with being fire captain?
It's weird.
(Eddie snickers) My last two couches came with girlfriends.
I think you mean your last two girlfriends came with couches.
Taylor moved out, what, four months ago, Buck?
You could have replaced the couch by now.
Uh, well, maybe I don't want to pick the wrong couch again.
Maybe that's how Bobby feels about interim captain.
(both laughing) CHIMNEY: Hey.
Sorry to bust in on your night off.
No worries. What happened?
Well, we were getting ready for bed, we heard rain.
Found out it was raining in my kitchen.
Oh. What did your landlord say?
He's with the plumber right now.
Hopefully it'll be an easy fix.
(Chimney exhales sharply) Calling a plumber at 9:00 on a Saturday night?
Daddy.
Can you say "double overtime"?
Oh, my God, did you have plans?
No, I just ordered in. I was gonna finish that movie we started watching last week. Here we go.
Whoa. Without me?
Maddie, you fell asleep watching it. Twice.
Okay, well, maybe third time's the charm.
(Chimney laughs) (phone chiming) Is that the landlord?
Yeah.
I should have water by tomorrow.
(phone chiming) Or Wednesday.
Sounds like your landlord needs to find a better plumber.
Yeah. And I'm gonna need a hotel room because I can't go four days without running water.
You know who else has running water? Me.
Why don't you just stay here? I'll crash on the couch.
You girls can have the bedroom.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to impose.
Maddie...
we're still family, hmm? That's what we do.
We look out for each other.
Don't we, Baby Jee?
All right.
Now, remember to keep your head down.
I know.
Keep that left arm straight.
I know.
Just pretend you're swinging in a barrel.
Okay, Dad, what does that even mean?
All right. It means you want to keep all your weight back on your right foot.
Minimize your hip turn when you swing.
(wood chipper rumbling) Keep your head down, looking at the ball.
Wait, what?
You want to keep your weight back, limiting your-your...
Wait, I...
(rumbling) Hey. Hey, guys!
Do you mind? We-We're trying to hit here.
(shuts off) ELTON: You know what?
Forget it. I'll shut up, just do whatever feels natural. But...
I'm gonna give you a little good luck charm. (chuckles) Your lucky ball? Come on, Dad.
Don't put more pressure on me.
Ah, come on. You can do it.
(clangs) Oh, I hate this stupid game.
I didn't see it come down, but I'm sure we'll find it.
You know, there's another thing that could be affecting your swing.
That new hardware on your left hand.
My wedding ring?
Dad, don't even start.
Vito and I are married now whether you like it or not.
We're very happy, I might add.
I'm not talking about your shotgun wedding.
Only that you should try wearing a rubber wedding band on the course like I do.
You never used to play this bad when you and Joey were dating.
Yes, I did.
You just didn't care because you and Joey would always team up and "go low" or whatever.
Half the time I'd quit at the turn, and you barely seemed to notice.
ELTON: Man, that Joey was one hell of a putter.
Great on the fairway, too.
You sure he wasn't the one?
Yes.
(wood chipper starts) (Leon screaming) God!
Aah!
Are you okay?
Yeah. I think so.
That ring saved my hand.
(sirens wailing) (horn honks) Dispatch, 118 is at the golf course.
Victim in sight.
How long has he been down?
We heard there was a shooting. I got this one, Cap.
Uh, have you recovered the weapon?
Negative. It's still embedded in the victim's chest.
BUCK: Okay, we better double-time it.
You guys know what to do. Let's go, let's go, come on.
Hang in there, Dad. Help is here.
BOBBY: Excuse me, sir, can you step back?
My team is gonna take a look at your dad.
I'll take a look at that hand.
Let's move back here, give them some space.
EDDIE: I got you, sir, I got you.
(Elton groaning) HEN: Looks like we got a keyhole thoracic entry wound on the right sternum.
Bleeding is steady, but from the lack of spurting, looks like it missed the aorta.
(Elton groans) EDDIE: Heart rate is 165 BPM.
Systolic BP is 98, indicating the patient was likely struck by a large-caliber round.
What was your dad shot with?
My tungsten wedding ring.
Never saw that in combat.
Based on his bilateral breathing, it looks like his ribs stopped the ring from puncturing the lung.
Preparing hemostatic bandaging to pack the wound.
Running morphine and fluids.
How exactly did this happen?
I was trying to fish a ball out of the wood chipper, but my hand got sucked into the blade.
My ring jammed it long enough for my hand to slide out.
But then the ring just went through.
Don't worry, Cap, securing the perimeter. I'm on it.
CHIMNEY: Well, your five fingers are still intact.
None of them appear to be broken, so I guess you're very fortunate you're not single.
All right, let's get him on a gurney and transport.
Doctors should be able to remove the offending ring at the hospital.
I'm gonna call Mom and tell her to meet us at the hospital.
Oh, and tell Joey I'm not gonna make it to the driving range tonight.
You're seriously still playing golf with my ex-boyfriend?
He's like the son I never had.
The one who can play golf.
Being a 911 dispatcher will be challenging and exhausting, and can take an emotional toll.
The people who call are scared, in need, and we are their lifeline.
But it's also rewarding.
Calling us is probably the scariest moment of their lives.
But if we do our jobs right and help arrives in time and we get a little lucky, then maybe it doesn't have to be the worst moment of their lives.
She nails it every time.
Do you have goose bumps?
Don't you?
A new call center, a new team of dispatchers, and Chimney asking you to move back in with him.
Everything's returning to normal around here.
I wouldn't go that far.
He did not ask me to move back in.
I'm just staying with him for a few days.
Or forever.
It's not like that.
Why not?
You clearly still love each other.
Just get back together already.
What if he's not ready for that? You know?
I know that he loves me, I just don't know if he wants to be with me.
You can't keep playing these guessing games, Maddie.
If you can't figure out what he wants, maybe you should tell him what you want.
MAY: Wow, they all look so... young.
These are your future college roommates?
Yeah.
But when they see me walk in, they're gonna think I'm their R. A.
Are you having second thoughts?
I mean, I said I wanted the full college experience, and here it is.
Mm-hmm.
Now, I'm sure I'll adjust.
I mean, I have to, right?
It's not like I can go back to my job or my apartment or all the other things I gave up to be roomed with three high school girls that were randomly selected for me by a computer.
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Okay.
I'll be fine.
It's going to be an adventure.
Enjoy it.
Yes.
All right, what do you think?
MAY: That you're a mustache away from giving serious <i> Magnum P. I.</i> vibes.
(chuckles) Hey, I'm in full cruise mode here.
I got to make sure my resort wear is on par with the competition.
Why don't you bring both of them?
When else would you get a chance to wear those at home?
Well, I would, but I already committed to one small roller bag.
Well, how many bags are you bringing, Mom?
More than one.
Uh-huh, and I have accounted for that.
Our stateroom is exactly 330 square feet...
Oh, my.
... but the closet's only 25.
I don't want us stepping over our bags the whole time.
ATHENA: 330 square feet?
I mean, let me guess.
That's already been logged in to the cruise spreadsheet?
Right next to the dinner specials and the daily activities.
And I still need you to sign off on some of my selections so we can lock those down.
I told you I'm good with the branzino.
Right.
I just don't see why I would have to jump off of a perfectly good boat for no reason.
It's called snorkeling, and it's fun.
It's a whole nother world down there.
I'm more than happy with the one I'm in.
Which one?
The shirt on the right.
Done.
(chuckles) Looks like you're gonna have an adventure, too.
(May laughs) (upbeat fanfare playing) ROD BILLINGS (over bullhorn): Welcome to Rod Billings Cars and the annual "touch a car, win a car" contest.
The rules are very simple.
One hand must be touching a car at all times.
No exceptions.

Now, who's ready to touch a car?
ALL: Win a car!
Let the games begin.
(blows whistle) (air horn blows) (crowd cheering) Yeah!

Win a car. Win a car.

(screaming) (snickers) Oh, God!
(horns honking) (sirens wailing) We got a call about an injured-- Hey, how long have these people been standing out here?
28 hours.
Uh, is that even legal?
Let's take a listen.
(panting) Ma'am, when's the last time you had any water?
Two days.
Been trying not to drink that much because water equals pee, and pee equals losing.
And I need this car.
Well, based on your lower back pain and what sounded like fluid in your lungs, I'm guessing you're suffering from acute kidney failure. Not to mention you probably damaged your bladder.
Look, I need to keep one hand on this car at all times. Can't you run an IV in the other arm or something?
(chuckles): Okay...
How you feeling, sir? I can't imagine it'd be easy being out in the sun going on two days.
I'm doing fine.
I could go a whole nother day.
(chuckles) REMI: Me, too.
Cap, we got to do something. She's refusing to leave.
My guy won't budge either. He's in it to win it.
Okay, how about this competition gets paused so they can get treatment?
You can pick it up in a day or two, maybe inside so they're out of the elements?
Sorry, but no can do.
What do you think people are gonna say when they find out a woman died at your dealership?
I am trying to give you an out here.
Rules are rules.
Okay, and the rules are they have to keep one hand on one part of the vehicle at all times, right?
That's right.
Okay, Buck?
Oh, am I on it, Cap.
Saws and jaws.
"Saws"?
You're not gonna cut that lady's arm off, are you?
I don't need to. She just needs to keep her hand on some part of the vehicle at all times.
You didn't say that part has to remain attached to the vehicle.
You can't just come in here and carve up my inventory like that!
Hey, "rules are rules." Oh, hey, more reporters.
It's gonna play great on the morning news.
(saw buzzing) <i> They both win a car!</i> <i> Because here</i> <i> at Billings Auto Emporium,</i> <i> the only thing bigger than</i> <i> our deals are our hearts.</i> (knocking) Athena?
Wait, what time is it?
3:15.
(groans) Our lunch date was 2:00, wasn't it?
Yep. I figured you forgot, but after you canceled the last few times, decided that I would force the issue.
Even brought you some tacos from Don Rivera's.
Your favorite.
Oh... (chuckles) Friend.
I don't know whether to lead with "I'm so sorry" or "Thank you, I'm starving." Ah, neither is necessary.
I know how busy you've been with work, family and medical school.
(scoffs) Oof.
It's starting to feel like I'm the living example of that whole "be careful what you wish for" thing right now.
I hear you have some big exams coming up next week.
End of year two.
I used to think they were exaggerating about how bad the boards would be.
Now I'm starting to think that maybe they undersold it.
(laughs) Oh, I know you must be feeling a lot of pressure. Have you talked to David?
I mean, he's been where you are.
Is he coming back from Haiti soon?
Oh, it doesn't sound like it. He, Michael and Harry have set up a home base in Miami, and David commutes from there.
How do you feel about all that?
(phone chimes) Now, you know I miss Harry.
But he sounds happy.
That's what matters to me.
All right, well, maybe I will give David a call.
(phone chiming) I just need to get through these finals and then I can take a breath.
Who is that texting you?
Just some cruise update from Bobby.
I mean, he has been watching this ship's activity calendar like it's the ball dropping from Times Square on New Year's.
What? I thought the whole point of those things was to unplug and relax.
It is for me, but Bobby wants to keep busy.
Six nights, seven days.
11 bars.
Oh.
I'm sure it's not the easiest place in the world for someone who's in the program.
But he's trying to show me a good time, so I don't mind returning the favor.
(phone chimes) Oh.
Oh, great.
An eco-tour?
Listen.
If that trip gets to be too much, you could always hide in the spa.
If? Okay.
(music playing) Huh, did not see that coming.
Ooh, what'd I miss?
(scoffs) I missed everything.
Again.
Third time is definitely not the charm.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Why don't you just go to bed?
Because I hate admitting defeat.
And it's still really early.
Isn't it?
(both laugh) You know, it's weird, the only reason why I picked this movie is 'cause I thought you would like it.
I don't know. Maybe I just don't have the patience for these movies anymore, you know?
Two people meet, you know that they're gonna end up together.
And then you have to watch 'em bumble their way through stupid misunderstandings for two hours.
I don't know. It's kind of annoying.
So you'd rather your rom-coms have less "com." I don't know.
I guess I would rather see two people overcome real problems and...

You fled your own apartment?
What? I had to get to work.
Two hours early?
You know how the morning after can get kind of awkward?
I just figured it might be easier for me to not be there for it. Is that so bad?
Don't look at me.
I once asked Shannon to sneak out of my house so Christopher wouldn't see her in my bed.
(chuckles) You see?
Compared to that, I'm as chivalrous as Sir Galahad.
Or as delusional as Don Quixote.
I don't understand. Isn't this what you've been wanting?
What the two of you been working towards?
It is, it just feels like I'm waiting for...
something.
Well, with Shannon, I tried to tell myself I was doing it to protect Christopher.
The truth is, I was just doing it to protect myself.
What's wrong with that?
You didn't skip the morning after conversation, Chim.
You just delayed it.
And you added a whole new complicated layer.
I had a one-night stand with my ex.
I don't know what the rules are.
Maybe that's what you need to find out.
Whoa!
I am so sorry!
That I bumped into you? Don't be.
I-I'm...
Maddie!
Your class is sort of legend at the academy.
A 7.1 earthquake your first day on floor.
I'm Noah.
Uh, good to meet you, Noah.
So, any tips for the newbie?
(exhales) Remember to breathe.
(chuckles) The person on the other end is already panicked and they don't need you to be.
Sounds easy.
I'm pretty sure it isn't.
It gets easier eventually.
What's your name and where are you calling from?
My name is Kenyon and we live at 646 Ridgeline Court.
<i> Hi, Kenyon. I'm Maddie.</i> How old are you? <i> I'm 12.</i> <i> But my brother's only six.</i> My mom left me to look after him while she went to the grocery store and now he's gone.
Okay, start from the beginning. What happened?
We were playing hide-and-seek and he just disappeared.
Jeremy!
What, do you think maybe he's still hiding?
<i> I don't know.</i> <i> It's been a really long time.</i> <i> And I've looked everywhere.</i> I keep yelling his name, and he always comes out when he can tell I'm mad.
Jeremy! <i> Okay.</i> Usually we don't send the police until we know someone's missing.
But I'm gonna send an officer to you just in case.
What if he ran away?
Has he done that in the past?
<i> No, but I used to</i> <i> when I was his age.</i> "Used to"?
Why'd you stop? <i> My mom.</i> <i> She'd get so scared.</i> It took her a really long time to stop worrying about me.
Yeah, yeah.
I bet it's hard to get over being afraid like that.
What are you afraid of?
Uh, what?
<i>Is there someplace in the house</i> <i> or the yard</i> <i> that no one ever goes?</i> Someplace that's so creepy you hate having to go there?
Uh, under the house.
My mom used to store Christmas decorations under there.
Sounds exactly like the last place your brother would expect you to look for him.
Are you serious, Jeremy?!
Dang it!
You found me.
MOTHER: I'm home!
<i> I got to go. Thanks, Maddie.</i> Yeah, you're welcome.
(chuckles) Hi.
I'm not leaving.
The apartment or...?
This family.
That's what you called us, and that's what I want.
The three of us together.
That's...
that's what I want, too.
When I woke up the other morning and you were gone, I felt... sad.
Yeah.
Probably the way you felt every day those six months that I was gone.
Look, I don't expect you to keep apologizing for that.
I'm not.
We're past apologies.
This is a promise.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm done running.
Me, too.
(chuckles) (indistinct radio transmission) (grunting) What you doing in my ambulance?
Uh,<i> our</i> ambulance, and...
I got to say, Wilson, it's kind of a mess in there.
No labels on the drawers.
Tough for an outsider to find their way around.
Sort of the point.
If I'm elected interim captain, I would have you doing some serious maintenance right now.
A whole organizational overhaul.
This is not a class president election, Buckley.
And you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
What I'm talking about is, your fluid levels are also low.
Oh, really, which ones?
'Cause I just topped off the oil, transmission, brake and coolant.
Per my report, your windshield wiper reservoir is down to three-quarters full.
Uh, you can't just take that.
It's department property.
And a weapon in the wrong hands.
Cap, you need to officially announce your replacement because I can't take any more of Buck trying to prove himself.
Oh, that's what he's been doing.
I'll have a talk with him.
So, who is it gonna be?
Our new interim captain.
It's a tough call.
And, honestly, I wanted it to be you.
(stammers) Me?
What?
You're smart, dedicated, compassionate, and you're decisive.
You're a great leader.
(stammers, chuckles) I mean...
you know when I first entered this department, Captain Gerrard didn't even see me as a firefighter.
And now, 12 years later, my boss is telling me that I have everything it takes to make a great captain.
And you do.
But you didn't pick me.
I know how much you have going on outside of work.
And I didn't want to overburden you.
It's not that much of a burden, Cap, I'm already here.
Right, there's all this paperwork...
Already do a lot of paperwork, Cap.
This can add another hour or two to every shift.
You'll be gone a week. That's what?
Three shifts?
Okay, so you'll do it?
Yeah.
I'll do it.
(indistinct radio transmission) Hey.
Oh, uh, h-hey, Cap.
I'm so sorry this is still such a mess.
I'll have it polished and reorganized within the hour.
I think it all looks great.
I see you've been going the extra mile lately and I appreciate it.
Oh, just trying to show you what I got.
I already know what you got, Buck.
But I'm not naming you interim captain.
Hen has agreed to take on that role.
Okay?
Um, yeah, no, I mean...
come on, it's Hen, she'll-she'll make a great captain.
And so will you.
Someday.
You're a great firefighter.
When you're all in, nobody goes harder than you.
But being a good leader is about more than just the work. It's also about life experience.
And I think you need some more of that before you're ready.
Is this 'cause I don't have a couch?
Why don't you have a couch?
I-I don't know, um...
I guess I-I've been having trouble picking one out.
I think I'm afraid of making a mistake again.
In AA there's this idea that you take inventory of your life admit your shortcomings in hopes that one day you can look at the world straight in the eye and be alone at perfect peace and ease.
Come on, you, uh, you don't think I'm at ease? (chuckles) I think the important thing is that you answer that question for yourself.
But when you are, you'll know.
And then you'll be ready.

PINO: At least 24 hours.
Run more tests, then see where we are tomorrow.

PINO: Mrs. Carter, your husband suffered an ischemic stroke.
It's not only serious, but the prognosis is uncertain.
Samuel's very strong.
I have no doubt, but we don't know how he will or will not respond to the treatment.
We have to be prepared.

It looks fine.

Maybe you should.
Mama!
Well, nobody asked you to invade my home.
I haven't pulled that trundle bed out in years.
Maybe your big, strong fireman can do it.
Mama, I swear...
It-It's okay.
It's okay. Beatrice, we'll set ourselves up.
I do not know what is in her head.
Well, her world did just crash down around her.
Well, this does look worse than I thought.
But I can get the car out of there, board up the windows. We will need to contact a contractor...
That we have.
Old family friend.

You think you can get this car out of here by yourself?
Big, strong fireman.

Oh, it's, uh, it's Bobby's.
Oh, are you trying to tell us something?
Um, no, he just, he told me about this idea in AA. I took it upon myself to, you know, dig a little deeper.
Hey, can... can I ask you something?
Sure.
Are you at ease?
Do I look like I'm at ease, Buck?
No, sorry, wrong question. It's just in-in the book, it says that if I'm at ease, "all my fear will fall away from me." Well, let me know how that works out.
Yes, sir, I hear the sirens, too.
You're welcome.
What did we say about lurking, Noah?
Sorry.
I just wanted to thank you.
For saving me, you know, when I crashed and burned.
You didn't do either of those things.
Today you learned how the element of surprise can refocus a caller's attention.
And if that doesn't work?
Try singing to them.
There was this guy who went off Mulholland into the ravine.
And I had to sing a few bars of the Thompson Twins' "Hold Me Now." It was playing on his radio, and by hearing me sing it...
It got him to pay attention.
I wish I could listen to more calls.
Didn't they give you samples at the academy?
I already listened to all of them. Also I'm pretty sure they were as old as the Thompson Twins.
Okay, uh...
If you want some more recent calls, just check out the active logs.
Put in your ID number and...
All the calls I could ever want.
Awesome.
I promise I won't play the one of you singing.
No, no, go ahead. I nailed it.
Chamomile delivery.
(chuckles) Chimney, you're a godsend.
Hey, uh...
don't you have finals this week?
I thought you'd be hitting the books.
Ah, later.
You would not believe how much extra paperwork arresting a guy generates.
(laughs) I got to get through all of this so that I can make a 10:00 review class.
Did you just bring me some tea or you were waiting for me to spill some tea?
(laughs) Uh...
the aforementioned finals, they decide if you get into your third year, right?
That is correct.
So why did you agree to become captain?
If you knew all of this was coming down the pike.
Trust me.
I-I got this.

Nice to meet you.
Been too long, Athena.
When you left for California, all of us were a little sad.
(laughs) You were sad because you lost your favorite target.
This boy chased me all through the orange groves.
(laughs) (both laugh) Listen, I did what I could, but the place definitely needs a professional touch.
Oh, more than a touch.
Yeah, we'll have to reframe all of this.
Mm-hmm. We assumed that.
We were talking about turning this into a ramp.
Yeah.
And then pulling these windows out and putting in double pane.
Might as well update things since we at it. (laughs) Update what?
I like my house.
Mama, we don't know what's gonna happen with Daddy.
I mean, he might need to spend some time at a rehab facility, but, when he comes home, we want him to have more space.
You're acting like he's already dead.
No...
Talking about updating my house.
I'm just trying to give him quality of life.
You want to sell it.
I'm not surprised.
You'll be glad when you're rid of us and can go back to your fancy life in California.
Okay, Beatrice, that's enough. Stop.
You're not doing this, not now.

Sorry about that.

And, uh, here's an itinerary for day one.
Sweet. Thank you. There you go.
Ronald.
You guys usually travel in a pack?
Or are you in a band?
(all chuckle) Uh, we were in a band.
That's where we met. Sixth grade.
Uh, trombone...
Uh, trumpet.
Baritone sax.
Band buddies.
Yeah.
All you guys are missing is a drumline.
We left those at home.
Our wives. They keep us on the beat.
Right.
(laughing) <i> WOMAN (over comm):</i> <i> Frankie? Frankie Hannah.</i> Go for Frankie.
<i> We need more chairs</i> <i> in the Desert Ballroom.</i> Copy that. I'm on my way.
Gentlemen, enjoy your day.
Be happy.
Thanks.
(indistinct chatter) Here's one about the seven keys to happiness.
You want to start with that one?
Sounds good to me.
<i> WOMAN (over P. A.):</i> <i> Welcome to the WestPlex</i> <i> Convention Center.</i> <i> The International</i> <i> Happiness Symposium</i> <i> is officially open.</i> <i> Please, come find</i> <i> your key to happiness...</i> "Sponsored by Felicidades Spirits and Liquor." Yeah, well, maybe they'll hand out free drinks.
(laughs) I think they're sponsoring the whole convention.
I swear to God, if the key to happiness is to drink more, I'm out.
God, would you stop?
You have done nothing but whine since we landed at LAX.
Come on, a bunch of quacks gonna teach us the secret to happiness?
This is one of the dumbest ideas you ever had.
Then why did you come?
(cracking overhead) Because he made me.
You gonna jump in here?
Look out!
(panicked shouting) Stay where you are. Help is on the way.
(sirens wailing) (horns honking) (electricity crackling) Buck, Chim, you're with him.
Eddie, Julie, you get these two.
(victims coughing) Let's get these people to the treatment area.
(pained groaning) Ronny, Angelo, I'm Eddie, this is Julie.
Nice when the bodies are already tagged, eh, Julie?
Oh, would you shut your trap, Ange, for once?
Can you both feel your legs?
More than I'd like.
Where the hell is Lev?
Is he okay? Lev!
Kind of in the middle of something.
(Angelo groans) I guess under the middle of something.
Vitals holding. Let's run two lines on him, wide open.
(device beeping) I can't feel anything.
Is that bad?
Not necessarily.
Could be some swelling that's causing the numbness.
Let me take a look.
Uh, hey, so you guys were attending the convention together?
Post-retirement boys' trip.
And here I thought everyone just took up golf when they retired.
Oh, do not say it.
I told you so.
Oh, God, he says it.
Seems like you guys have known each other for a while.
Ever since sixth grade.
That's nice.
That you guys have stayed close this long.
I'd like to be less close right now, if you don't mind. (grunts) (groans) Can you move this thing?
All right. But it is gonna hurt.
(groaning) All right, ready?
On three.
One, two, three.
(Angelo cries out) Put it back! (crying out) What happened?
(Angelo groans) Your fibula's punctured his thigh.
Hit a major artery.
Are we gonna be okay?
Yeah. They're in great hands, and you're next.
Okay. Those two...
will kill each other without me.
Uh, Lev, hey, hey.
You, uh, you never told me why.
Why a happiness convention, huh?
Trying to figure out some stuff.
Thought maybe we'd find an answer here.
You-you guys weren't happy?
You live your whole life, doing everything you're supposed to.
Marriage, kids.
Big house, nice cars.
Weekends at the shore.
Hey, that, uh, doesn't sound too bad, right?
It wasn't.
It's just this 40-year blur.
Work and family.
Never enough time.
Until one day work stops, and everything finally comes into focus.
You're not sure what you're looking at.
What was the point of...
any of it?
I'm here, sir. Are you able to speak up?
What's your name? <i> Frankie. I'm trapped.</i> <i> NOAH: Do you know</i> <i> your address, Frankie?</i> I'm at the WestPlex Convention Center.
We've got a team on scene, Frankie.
<i> I think I'm too buried.</i> I was up top moving some chairs when it all came crashing down.
Captain 118, we've got another victim on scene.
<i> His name is Frankie.</i> <i> Says he's completely buried.</i> (indistinct chatter) Dispatch, need help finding a location.
He says he was moving some chairs from the ballroom.
(grunts) Frankie! Where are you hurt?
Hard to breathe.
Hang in there, Frankie.
(whimpers) We got him!
Yeah!
We're coming to get you.
(sobs) No distal pulse on Angelo.
Normally we travel you with a foreign object, but in this case, the object is your friend.
So what do we do?
Pull you apart very carefully.
Dispatch, the victim's showing signs of a punctured lung.
We've already got two complicated rescues in progress.
133 is already en route.
The 133 will be there in 12 minutes.
I just, I don't have enough hands to get them both out right now, and I need the hydraulic jack for the kid.
Most likely, Lev has already bled out internally, and that slab of concrete's acting as a clamp, keeping him alive.
We lift it, most likely he dies anyway.
Kid's got a better shot.
Hey, Lev...
Hey.
You ready to get this thing off of me?
There's a kid buried over there.
I think he's got a punctured lung.
I-I need to get him out of there.
And you don't have enough guys.
You get that kid out.
I ain't going nowhere.
Go help the kid.
Buck.
Help me with this.
(grunts) (hydraulic jack whining) Are you guys clear?
I always thought it was Lev that kept us together.
(pained groaning) (groaning continues) All right, pull him out.
BUCK: All right, get him on the backboard.
One, two, three.
(Angelo, Ronny crying out) CHIMNEY: Clear?
EDDIE: Ready, yeah.
Up.
Three, two, up.
BUCK: We got him. We got him.
They saved the kid?
Yeah.
And you're next. You're next, Lev.
It's okay.
I got what I came for.
I think I get it now.

There's an old orange grove out there.
Out past the woods.
Where the bonfires happened when we all hung out in high school.
When I was a little girl, Daddy and I would go out there every Saturday morning, grab oranges and tangerines that had fallen from the trees.
Bring 'em home, make fresh juice, pour it over ice and sit, right here. (chuckles) I would sit on his lap.
He would tell me stories about the family, about all the great things that the Carters had done.
Daddy was an attorney, but his daddy had been one, too.
First Negro lawyer to pass the Florida bar.
Even graduated from A&M just like him.
And that's what made you want to be a lawyer.
Oh, it did.
And when I left for California, oh, he couldn't have been prouder.
Told me to spread my wings, do great things.
And what did Beatrice say?
"Do not drink that juice, it has not been pasteurized." (Bobby chuckles) Daddy was always the comfort.
Mama was the reality.
I'm not sure I'm ready to lose the comfort.
You haven't lost him yet.
You know the worst part of having to parent your parents?
It's knowing that you're that much closer to losing them.
Hey, uh, we're gonna grab some breakfast.
A little grub might hit the spot.
Uh, not for me. Not today.
Fair enough.
I gotta pass.
Copy that. Well-we'll be at the diner on Alvarado if you guys want to join us.
Hey, um, what... What do you think he meant?
You know, he said, "I get it now." And his eyes got all bright, and he looked up to the sky like he'd just found happiness.
I was there, Buck.
It was like he solved this...
this great mystery, and then he died before he could share it.
Hey, losing someone out there is never easy.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
To a design flaw.
I, uh, saw it on the news last night.
The hotel put in that walkway a couple years ago and tried to sue the contractor after they found some cracks but the repairs just...
Fell through the same cracks.
It was bound to come crashing down.
But not before Nathan Levinson learned the secret, right?
Maybe that's what we should focus on.
He found it before he died.
What, so he, he spent his whole life trying to figure it out, and then he finally gets the answer right at the end?
What, uh, what do you think it is?
The secret to happiness.

You're just standing there, letting that man treat your father like a criminal.
This is protocol, Mama.
He's doing his job.
Mrs. Carter?
The detective is almost done in there.
This isn't right and you know it.
Your father can't speak or defend himself.
He can't even consent to what they're doing.
They don't need consent, Mama.
That's what the warrant is for.
PINO: Well, everything else aside, Mr. Carter is showing signs of improvement.
His blood pressure has been stable for the last 24 hours.
The swelling in his brain has gone down considerably.
Enough to maybe bring him out of the coma?
That's what we're hoping.
I'll keep you posted.
Thank you.
The police are gonna want to talk to him as soon as he wakes up.
You keep these people away from your father.
Look at what they're doing to him.
BOBBY: Beatrice, I know this is difficult, but the police are just doing what they have to, and gathering samples is probably the best way to prove that Samuel is innocent.
He's right.
Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Nash.
Detective Clifford Dixon.
You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
The police department did nothing for 45 years to find that girl, now you want to pin it on a sick, incapacitated man.
My husband did not do what you're accusing him of.
Ma'am, we haven't accused him of anything.
Yet.
We just want to get to the truth, like I'm sure you do.
Because you're right, 45 years is a long time.
And the Kingston family deserves some justice.
So what happens next?
We're still sorting through the evidence and samples from the scene, but once we have forensics, we can test Mr. Carter's sample against it.
And I'd like to get you and your mother down to the station to give statements.
I know it was long time ago, but anything you might remember from that night could be helpful.

(stammers) Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, Michael.
I'm telling you, do not come.
No, keep Harry there with you and David.
He does not need to be here for this.
Look, I got to go. We just got back to the house.
Kiss Harry for me.
Okay, bye.
Junior's here.
ATHENA: And he brought his father.
I am so sorry.
One shock after another.
Still doesn't feel real.
Mr. Franklin.
Aw, it's good to see you.
It's been a while.
I would say it's good to see you, too, but...
not under these circumstances.
How you holding up?
Oh, best we can.
What about your mother?
She's still at the hospital. On top of everything, my father-- he's still not out of the woods.
She doesn't want to leave his side.
Of course. I wanted to come by when I heard about Samuel's stroke.
But then I saw the news last night.
Mm.
Anything me or Junior can do to help, don't hesitate to ask.
Now, who's this-- your bodyguard?
Bobby Nash, my husband.
Ah.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Good to meet you.
Glad you're here.
She's gonna need all the support she can get.
Now, you built the original structure, correct?
Yeah.
Laid the foundation myself.
JUNIOR: Uh, the police questioned him about it.
We just got back from the station.
They swabbed me for the DNA.
What do you remember?
I was so young, it's all kind of a blur.
All I can tell you is what I told the police.
I poured that concrete, left it to cure four, maybe five days.
I remember it was so humid, had to give it extra time.
The job site was exposed to the street.
Anyone could have put that girl in there.
It was long time before home security cameras.
(chuckles) This Florida room has been here so long, it's hard to remember a time when it wasn't.
Your mom had been on your dad for years to build that addition.
But he kept putting it off, saying he didn't have the money.
Then one day, he came by the shop.
Said he changed his mind.
Hmm, why the sudden change of heart?
You got to understand.
When that girl disappeared, it rocked this town.
Nobody was the same after that.
He said it'd be a good distraction.
A fun project for you and Beatrice.
When did he ask you to build it?
The day after the Kingston girl went missing.
JUNIOR: We've taken up enough of your time. We'll get out of your hair.
But if you need anything at all, we're here.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Come on, Pops.
I'm sorry, Athena.
I really am.
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
See ya.
Take care.
Okay.
BOBBY: Hey.
You doing all right? I know I keep asking you, but I've just been really worried about you.
(sighs) (car door closes) I'm not sure how I'm feeling.
(engine starts) REGGIE: Y'all take care.
(engine sputtering, popping) (exhales) What are... what-what are you doing?
I'm trying to see if there's anything here that might shed some light.
Did you know your father was a meticulous record keeper? He keeps all his old appointment books.
Oh, no, put that away, right now. All of it.
This is not yours to do.
You-you have no right to go through my father's things like this.
You're right, I don't.
It should be you.
What I don't understand is why it's not.
Why are you just standing on the sidelines?
Because that detective was right.
I'm not a police officer here.
Well, who cares what he said? Don't you want to clear your father's name?
Of course I do...
Athena, those doctors said they're gonna take Samuel off sedation in two days, and like you said, the police are gonna be there waiting for him.
Don't you want to be armed with the truth when they do show up?
What is it? What are you so afraid of?
I'm afraid he could have done it.
(softly laughing) (clears throat) GIRL: There's that girl.
The one whose little sister got kidnapped.
Don't touch me.
GIRL 2: Her name is Joanne.
I heard she got kicked out of school.
JOANNE: I said let go!
PATRICE: Have you lost your mind?
JOANNE: Oh, don't pretend you all of a sudden care about the one kid you have left.
PATRICE: Stop it.
Why are you always making my life so hard?
After everything I've been through.
JOANNE: Oh, right, because you're the only one this has happened to.
You know what, I think Daddy died just to get away from you.
Okay, how about we try to calm down here?
Shut up, Barney Fife.
Maybe you should try looking for my sister instead of harassing me.
You people are worthless.
Shut up.
Let's go.
Oh, hey there, little lady. I hope you're being careful out there.
Why does everyone keep saying that you're bad at your job?
Is it because you haven't found Tanya?
You shouldn't listen to everything everybody says.
Was Tanya your friend?
I saw her at school all the time and church.
Are you still looking for her?
Of course we are.
The truth is this is a really hard case.
We don't have a lot of clues to help us find her.
And you need clues.
Like a barrette in the woods.
How'd you know about that?
I heard my dad talking about it.
Is that the only clue you have?
Well, the only other thing we know is that somebody climbed in through that bedroom window and took her.
What about Joanne?
Why did you arrest her?
You sure do ask a lot of questions.
I like to know stuff.
I didn't arrest her.
I was just making sure she got home safe.
She's having a hard time.
I wish I could help her and her mom.
Me too.
Stay safe.
(engine starts) ♪ ♪ SAMUEL: You shouldn't be snooping around people's property.
I just...
wanted to see it for myself.
You always do.
Sometimes you got to know when not to let your curiosity get the best of you.
Don't go looking for stuff.
You might not like what you find.
Your father came home late that night.
I'm sure it wasn't the first time.
Yeah, when he came in, his shirt was all dirty.
He said he had a flat tire.
I mean, I remember because my father was always such a sharp dresser.
And that night he was disheveled.
I wasn't used to seeing him like that.
But you said he was out helping with the search.
He did, but lots of folk go back to the scene of the crime.
The same night, Bobby.
That's one hell of a coincidence.
Yeah, but this is your father we're talking about. He raised you.
You know he's not capable of doing anything remotely like this.
Anybody at any time is capable of doing a horrible thing.
I see it every day, so do you.
You know how many times I go to make an arrest and the family can't believe it?
Living under the same roof with a killer, and they had no idea.
The devil wears a familiar face and tricks you with his lies.
That sounds like something Beatrice would say.
I love my father, God knows I do.
He's my hero.
But he's just a man.
He could have had a life outside this house that I knew nothing about.
Then you need to find out the truth for yourself.
Before it's too late.
Oh, but w-what if I go looking and find something that proves the worst?
Am I supposed to hand that over to the police to arrest my father?
I can't be the one to send my father to prison.
You could be the person who clears his name.
ATHENA: House looks exactly the same.
Older and run down, but...
everything's as it was.
They even have the same flower boxes.
Still loose.
JOANNE: What the hell are you doing?!
ATHENA: Joanne, it's me.
Athena Carter.
All the more reason to shoot you right here.
Daughter of a murderer.
Okay, let's just stop, take a minute.
Don't do anything we're gonna regret.
JOANNE: Oh, I won't regret this.
Her father killed my sister.
See?
She can't even deny it.
Get off of me!
Joanne, I just want to talk.
Let go.
JOANNE: You got some nerve coming here.
I'm here because I want answers.
Just like you.
Am I supposed to feel sympathy for you?
Your father is a murderer.
He ruined my life.
And now you are here because he has ruined yours, too.
I know how hard this has been on your family.
I got no family left.
I imagine that must...
... tear you up inside.
What do you want to talk about?
I stopped coming in here after she was gone.
My mother kept it like a shrine.
Said she was keeping the room ready for when she came back home.
After Mama was gone, I...
I put a padlock on it and that was it.
A lot of painful memories.
You shared this room with your sister?
I hated it.
Nosy little sister.
She was always in my business.
ATHENA: This is the window they used when they took her.
JOANNE: How do you know?
The flower box.
It's loose. I remember it being loose back then, like someone stepping on it, which could have happened from climbing in.
Mm-hmm.
Looks like it's been stepped on more than once.
ATHENA: He's right.
You used to sneak out of this window, didn't you?
Did you sneak out that night?
Yes.
Tanya and I both did.
Sneaking out again, huh?
I'm meeting up with friends.
We're hanging out.
Does Mom know?
The only way Mom would know is if you tell her.
And we both know you're not gonna do that, so go to sleep.

You're not supposed to be here.

(laughs) Wow.
She doesn't miss a beat.

30 minutes. That's it.
Then you have to leave.
30 minutes? That's no time. An hour.
30 minutes and I'll...
take you to the movies on Saturday.
Oh, come on, Tanya, stop being so difficult.
I get to pick the movie.
Fine.

(scoffs) The silent treatment?
Really?
(scoffs) Come on, Tanya.
<i> ADULT JOANNE:</i> <i> I never saw her leave.</i> <i> Just assumed she made it home.</i> And you lied to the police back then?
Lied to my parents, too.
Told them that she was gone when I checked on her.
They saw the window was open.
It was easier to let them believe that.
Then they told the police what happened.
It was my fault.
If I hadn't snuck out that night, she'd still be here.
(siren wailing in distance) Joanne.
You don't know that.
Did you call the police?
You were trespassing.
(car doors close) It's okay, everything's fine.
I'm not gonna press charges.
Not sure that's up to you now.
Mrs. Nash, I thought we had an understanding that you were gonna let us do our job.
ATHENA: We were just leaving.
We came by to offer our condolences to Joanne.
That's all.
Is that right?
Because it looks a lot like your wife is interfering with an active investigation.
How about you come with me?
Wait a minute, you're arresting her?
In all fairness, you were warned.
(engine starts) <i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Can't imagine they'd book her.</i> Question her, sure, but she'll still need a lawyer.
Okay. Thanks. I will meet you there.
I'm sorry I got Athena in trouble.
Well, she can handle it, she's a police officer herself.
Well, that explains it. (chuckles) I want you to know that Athena's probably gonna tell the police what you told us: that Tanya wasn't taken from home.
That's new information that'll probably be helpful to them.
(sighs) There's something else.
That car we heard-- we couldn't see it from where we were hiding, but the sound it made, it was like a "put-put-put." I'd never heard a car sound like that before.
Okay, that's good to note.
I'll bring that up to Detective Dixon.
Listen, Joanne, you take care of yourself.
And lock that thing up.
<i> DIXON:</i> <i> So, what were you doing</i> <i> talking to Joanne Kingston?</i> One could think it was intimidation.
And one would be wrong.
Did you know that Tanya wasn't taken from her house like the Kingstons reported?
Did Joanne tell you that?
She did.
That night, she snuck out, and Tanya followed her.
All this time, you've been trying to solve this case with wrong information.
Not all of us.
The barrettes.
I got three little girls at home.
They never go to bed with their barrettes.
Always complaining to my wife about how much it hurts.
If she was taken from her sleep, I don't think she would have been wearing those.
Well...
I guess I confirmed it.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Is that the forensic report from the scene?
What else was found with the remains?
Not much.
Few scraps of cloth, the barrettes, plastic.
Everything else was disintegrated.
What about this? What is it?
Old-timers think it's a clasp from a harvesting bag.
Like they use for picking oranges.
Bags back then were canvas, so the clasp is all that's left.
The killer could have used something like this to transport her.
It's possible.
DNA?
Nothing.
Nothing to compare your father's sample to or Reggie Senior's.
Either it was wiped clean or, more likely, the hydrated lime in the concrete eroded any DNA that was present.
Hydrated lime.
That's usually mixed in with the concrete, yes?
Typically.
The levels here-- it looks like she was doused in it.
Like someone poured the lime all over her, then covered her body in the wet cement.
What's the difference?
Reggie Senior.
He said that he poured the foundation, then left it to cure. He said, "Anyone could have put that little girl in there." That is a very deliberate choice of words.
Deliberate because it wasn't true.
Exactly.
He covered her body in quicklime, knowing that it would erode all evidence, Then he encased her in cement.
(knocking) REGGIE: Knock, knock.
Special delivery.
Reggie.
What a wonderful surprise.
Just came by to see how you were doing.
And bring a little something to eat.
Got to keep your strength up.
Well, thank you.
How is he?
Improving.
They're hoping to take him off sedation in another day or two.
That so?
Seems like a lifetime.
Waiting like this.
Not knowing, and then, with everything else...
Beatrice.
I am so sorry.
It shouldn't be happening to you.
You and Samuel.
You don't deserve this.
Samuel is a good man.
You know it.
The whole town knows it.
To have his legacy tainted like this after all he's done.
REGGIE: I wish I could take it away.
I wish I could make it right.
You're not the one making my husband out to be some kind of killer.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, Beatrice.
<i> JOANNE:</i> <i> But the sound it made.</i> <i> It was like a "put-put-put."</i> <i> I never heard a car</i> <i> sound like that before.</i> (engine sputtering, popping) (phone vibrates) Hey. <i> BOBBY: Athena,</i> <i> I know who it is. It's Reggie.</i> <i> Joanne said she remembered</i> <i> hearing a car that night.</i> Said the engine had a very specific sound.
Said you couldn't mistake the sound of that thing.
It was Reggie's truck. <i> Bobby,</i> I saw the forensic report.
Tanya wasn't put<i> in</i> the wet cement.
<i>The cement was poured over her.</i> Reggie lied.
Are you still with Joanne? <i> No,</i> I'm at the orange grove right now. I was on my way to you, but then I saw Reggie's truck <i> parked off to the side</i> <i>of the road, but he's not in it.</i> I need to go warn Joanne.
(door creaks open) How did Reggie find Tanya that night?
Someone would have noticed an adult at the bonfire.
It doesn't make sense.
But Joanne heard Reggie's truck.
<i> ATHENA:</i> <i> This boy</i> chased me all through the orange groves.
(laughing) Reggie Senior wasn't the only one in that house <i> with a driver's license.</i> (gasps) Junior.
What are you doing here?
Taking care of loose ends.
JOANNE: Junior, please.
Why are you doing this?
I'm gonna help the police solve your sister's 45-year-old case.
The sister did it.
What?!
What are you talking about?
That night, when she crashed the party at the bonfire, you let her drink.
A lot.
And, of course, it was a tragic accident when you found her passed out and not breathing.
The guilt.
Oh, it's been killing you.
So you decided to take your life in the same place you took Tanya's.

Too bad you never thought about protecting them.

Oh, I still can't believe it.

Wanted to see how I was doing.

He just wanted to see if I knew anything.
Have you given any thought to what comes next?
I don't know.
Sell the house, maybe.
Fresh start.
Only reason I stayed was in case she came home one day.
Guess I never gave up hope, either.
Well, hope is a good thing.

I never forgot your sister.

Yeah, but probably not how you're imagining.
He was standing underneath the root ball of a fallen tree when it snapped back up on top of him.
That's a thing that happens?
BENNY: Well, sometimes after storms or if other debris pinning the downed tree falls away, the tension from the root system still underground can pull it back up.
Like a mighty oak slingshot.
Yeah, one that weighs several tons.

Yeah, well, so his theory is that we've all become too comfortable in our lives, right? We...
we go to the same jobs every day.
We hang out with the same groups of people.
We eat at the same restaurants, we shop at the same stores.
We don't do anything that makes us feel uncomfortable or-or that just scares us.
What about running into burning buildings?
No, it doesn't count. That's just work, you know?
Uh, before I came to L. A., I had all these adventures.
You know? I-I went new places, I tried new things, I met new people.
That's 'cause you were searching for something.
What are you looking for now?
That's what I'm gonna find out.
By opening myself up to possibility.
Okay. What about this?
You quit your job, become my nanny and then I can stop looking at these résumés.
That-that's gonna be a hard no.
No.<i> The Age of Absolutely</i> isn't about dramatic life changes, and becoming your new nanny would feel like a dramatic life change.
Well, so does hiring one. They're all either 12 or a potential serial killer.
Come on, don't limit them-- they could be both.
Uh, listen, I-I got to go.
Uh, I'm meeting my old roommate Connor and his new wife for dinner tonight.
Whoa, frat boy Connor?
That guy got married?
Yeah, like, two years ago.
Uh, we-we kind of lost touch, but...
reached out recently, invited me to dinner, and I said...
Absolutely?
There you go.
(chuckles) Good luck.
<i> CHRISTOPHER: This...</i> is the wrong kind of mayo.
It was on sale.
You know, Dad, sometimes you get what you pay for.
Great. I'm raising a condiment snob.
(groans) And an impulse shopper.
What is this?
Cereal.
Not sure a nutritionist would agree.
I got us the healthy one, too.
Balanced.
(chuckles softly) Lucky you're cute.
(phone vibrates) Oh, it's your school.
Wait, Dad, we didn't finish the groceries.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mr. Diaz.
Really?
I had no idea.
And how long has Christopher been skipping Science Club?
<i> HEN: I called maintenance.</i> They're gonna try to come by tomorrow.
Great.
Okay. Have a good shift.
Thanks.
BOBBY: You got a minute, Cap?
(sighs) Don't call me that.
Come on, just this once? (chuckles) No.
Since you're here, that must mean that Samuel's doing better?
Yes, he is.
He's finally getting settled back at home and Athena's finding somebody to come by, take care of her parents after she leaves.
When's that gonna be?
Probably end of next week.
How are you doing?
Good.
I uploaded everything to FireStat this morning, the duty rosters are...
I Wasn't asking about work.
I already know you did a great job.
Who called you? Chim?
Karen.
(exhales) How much did she yell?
No, she kept a perfectly respectable tone the entire time she called me an idiot.
I am sorry, Hen.
I shouldn't have put this on you.
I volunteered.
It's not your fault I flunked out of medical school.
Well, maybe I can call them, tell them what happened, and you could retake the test.
Thanks, Bobby.
I appreciate the gesture, but I don't think there's anything either of us can do.
Okay, well, maybe I can't fix the things at medical school, but I can do something-- give you a little time off.
You've been pushing too hard for too long, you're exhausted and you need a break.
So take as many days or weeks as you need to get recharged.
(exhales) That's an order.
Time off?
Not sure I even know what to do with that.
Try doing nothing.
And if anyone asks you to do anything, just say no.
(chuckling): So... is that when you moved into the frat house?
Hold on.
It wasn't a total frat house. Okay? We had real jobs.
Five guys under one roof?
That's a frat house.
We weren't that bad. Or... were we?
There-there was this one time when...
Well, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
We were smart enough not to bring women back to that place.
It wasn't really conducive to romantic evenings.
Oh. Well, good.
'Cause, before me, I'd like to think there were no romantic evenings.
Really? Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Uh, listen, I don't-I don't even know-- how-how did you guys meet?
The old-fashioned way.
At a bar.
He was picking up takeout and I was sitting at the bar eating, alone.
Not just eating alone but reading a book.
I was intrigued, so I sat next to her and ate my takeout right there.
And I thought he was some sort of weird stalker.
'Cause, I mean, who talks to strangers anymore?
Right, right. (chuckles) And who reads actual books?
Anyway, I charmed her with my corny jokes, He did.
and...
that was it.
That was it.
Wow, and-and your frat house days are finally behind you.
Yeah.
We actually bought a house last year.
We did.
You guys are really doing it all, huh?
Marriage, house, and... and kids?
Kind of.
We've sort of hit a snag on that last part.
It's crazy. When I was single, all I did was pray not to be pregnant, and now...
Nothing seems to get the job done.
Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.
You know, I-I think more people struggle with fertility issues than-than we realize.
But there's lots options now, right?
There's-there's drugs, IVF, even surrogacy.
Kameron's not the problem.
I am.
Not enough swimmers.
Uh, um...
Huh, I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.
Uh, th... um, that must be tough.
You have no idea.
But we're looking at other options.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, specifically, sperm donor options.
Nice.
Which is why we actually invited you to dinner.
(chuckles) We wanted to know if you'd consider being our sperm donor.
He's been lying right to my face.
Has he never lied to you before?
I mean, little things.
Like, did he brush his teeth before he went to bed or did he put the empty milk carton back into the fridge.
But not like this.
Well, in his defense, Science Club does sound kind of boring.
Joining was his idea.
Probably knew it would make a great cover. Smart kid.
HEN: So, wait, if he wasn't going to Science Club, then where was he?
At the park with his friends, apparently.
Which I really don't understand, because he knows that I'd take him there anytime he wants.
Maybe that's the problem.
No offense, but Christopher might be getting to that age where he doesn't want Dad around all the time.
Yeah, kids do grow to crave privacy.
Half the thrill sometimes is doing something and thinking you're getting away with it.
He should've told me that before he got caught lying, got grounded for one week.
No video games, no exemptions.
Tough but fair.
Notice you're being awfully quiet over there, Buck.
Christopher hasn't said anything to you about these little secrets, has he?
Uh, to me? No, no-no secrets here.
Buck probably can't relate because he always tells us the truth about his life, often in excruciatingly specific detail.
Mm.
Hen, you're supposed to be on leave.
What are you doing here?
I, uh... uh, swung by to, uh, pick up some kombucha that I left in the fridge.
Really? Where is it?
I couldn't find it.
Hmm.
I guess somebody drank it.
Hmm.
My house is too damn quiet, Cap.
Karen's off at work, Denny's with his friends.
I have no tests to study for and the silence is kind of deafening.
I-I-I just needed to come somewhere with a little bit more noise.
(alarm ringing) (indistinct announcement over P. A.) BOBBY: Hen, I say this with love.
Don't be here when we get back.
(engine starts) (indistinct chatter) Dispatch, 118 is on the scene, Eighth and Alameda.
Five cars and one bike.
All right. How you feeling sir?
(groaning) I'm just... happy I wore a helmet.
Feels like you have a broken fibula.
SCOTTY: Yeah. (grunting) My left leg took the brunt of the hit, but...
I was able to ride out of it, so...
(exhaling sharply) Must be a some kind of bike.
What happened?
I was just cruising on my steel frame, and that idiot over there swerved into the bike lane.
He hit me and then veered into that oncoming car.
He was driving like a crazy person!
Or a drunk one.
Smells like a distillery in here.
Chim, you need a coroner?
Nope, he's still alive. Pulse is strong with this one.
(grunting) The other side...
LAFD. Can you hear me?
Sir, can you hear me?
No response to sternal rub.
I'm gonna take his vitals.
We need to cut him out and transport him, ASAP.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do not do that. (shouts) Oh, my God.
(horn honking) Where the hell is he going?
Wait a sec, is Chim still in the car?
Dispatch, be advised we have a possible drunk driver who just drove off with one of our paramedics in a silver Prius.

<i> (chuckling)</i> I finally got Christopher to actually go to his Science Club meeting today, but 20 minutes in, I get a call from his teacher saying he's refusing to participate.
She said it was an extracurricular club, so if he doesn't want to be there, I should just take him home. <i> That doesn't sound</i> <i> like Christopher.</i> Yeah.
I tried to talk about it with him and...
he ignored me the whole drive back. <i> That part--</i> <i> that part sounds like us.</i> <i> The old Diaz family</i> <i> cold shoulder.</i> <i> Your Abuela originated it,</i> <i> but as I recall,</i> <i> you perfected it.</i> Ha, ha, very funny.
<i> (chuckles)</i> Everyone keeps on telling me this is normal and that I should give him some room to grow, but...
I can't help it if it's my instinct to always want to protect him.
You know, the world is tough. And he's not.
<i> Maybe you're</i> <i> overcorrecting because...</i> <i> because I didn't</i> <i> protect you enough.</i> <i>You had to grow up a lot faster</i> <i> than you should have.</i> <i> But that doesn't mean you can</i> <i>keep Christopher a kid forever.</i> <i> You can't stop the biological</i> <i> clock from ticking.</i> There's a snooze button I can hit?

Uh...
Hey.
Hey, man.
Do you have a minute?
Look, I just wanted to come by and apologize for the other night.
We pretty much blindsided you, and I really feel terrible about that.
Uh, yeah, you did catch me off guard.
I know.
I haven't seen you in three years and the first time we reconnect, I asked for body fluids.
(chuckles softly) That wasn't the right way to ask you.
Is there is a... a right way to ask that question?
(clicks tongue) Probably not.
Mm.
(laughs) Come on. Take a seat. (exhales) Uh, so, hey, are you-are you doing okay?
(Connor clears throat) Do you know what it feels like to feel like a total failure as a man, and like you're letting down the woman you love?
Uh, probably not in the same way you feel right now.
I assumed it was her.
You know, we were trying for months, changing her diet, ovulation thermometers, the whole bit.
Never occurred to me that I couldn't do this for her.
For us.
Yeah, I-I got to ask you.
Why me?
I mean, you could go to a sperm bank, you could-you could pick someone with perfect genes.
Yeah.
We could flip through a book and know stuff like their eye color, whether they're gonna be a scientist or an artist or what their body type is.
But we couldn't know if they'd be a good person.
How they treat the people they care about.
I know those things about you.
That's way more important than the superficial stuff.
I...
(chuckles softly) I swear, this isn't me trying to convince you.
No, it's, uh...
it's nice to hear.
Thank you for saying that.
Thank you for hearing me out.
I know this is asking too much.
I'm letting you off the hook here.
You do not need to do this.
<i> CLARIBELLE:</i> <i> The SeeWahPah</i> <i> laughed an evil laugh.</i> (cackles) She creeps to the tent the boy was hiding in.
Then...
Uh...
The brave woodsman.
The brave woodsman and his spotted dog with five toes on his paws ran to the woods.
And the five-toed dog barks.
(barks) (howls) Then, the SeeWahPah runs through the woods on its backward feet, and was never heard from again.
Very good,<i> mija.</i> Very good.
Mommy?
Uh-huh?
Are Ciguapas real?
I don't know.
That's what<i> abuela</i> says.
But I've never seen one.
Not even when you lived in Santo Domingo?
(sighs) Why don't you help me make dinner?
Can I cut the vegetables?
(speaking Spanish) (knocking) Clari, it's time.
(knocking in distance) (Lourdes loudly speaking Spanish in distance) (man shouting) (line ringing) (thud) <i> MADDIE:</i> <i> 911, what's your emergency?</i> <i> CLARIBELLE: You have to help.</i> <i> It's my dad.</i> Is someone hurting him?
<i> No, he's here.</i> <i> He found us.</i> <i> He's gonna kill us.</i> <i> (Claribelle exclaims)</i> Okay, can you tell me your name and address?
<i> Claribelle.</i> <i> 215 Greencrest Street.</i> Hi, Claribelle. I'm Maddie.
I'm sending help to you right away.
Are you home alone?
No. My mom's here, too.
She sent me to call you.
<i> She always said that</i> <i> if my Dad came,</i> <i> I should call 911 right away.</i> Claribelle, can you give me your address again?
215 Greencrest Street.
Are you sure? <i> I-I...</i> I don't know.
(thuds) LOURDES: Get out of my house!
Please, Maddie, help us! He's inside!
It's okay, honey, just hold on for me.
Everything okay?
(sighs) I have a domestic battery in progress, but I can't locate them.
Cell phone towers say Lincoln Park, but the address she gave me is showing up as invalid.
What is it?
215 Greencrest.
He already broke down the front door.
They don't have a lot of time.
If there's that much commotion going on, maybe someone heard it.
Another 911 call?
Hang on. I'll go check.
Claribelle, you still with me?
(pounding) Yes, I'm here. Are you sending help?
Soon, sweetheart. Where are you in the house?
In my room.
Is there any place you can hide until help gets there?
<i> Uh, my closet?</i> Good, go in there.
(Lourdes screams) (Stephen grunting) 215 Glencrest.
Police and RA are already en route.
No, wait, if he hears them coming, uh, he could make her a hostage. Radio them again with an update and tell them to run cold.
On it.
Claribelle, help is almost there.
(loud clattering) (glass shatters) <i> (panting)</i> I don't hear her anymore.
<i> Do you think she's dead?</i> (sighs) I don't know.
He always told my Mom that she doesn't belong in this country.
<i> And that he could take me away</i> <i> from her if he wants to,</i> <i> and she'll never see me again.</i> That's why we ran.
STEPHEN: Claribelle?
<i> Claribelle.</i> Baby?
He's looking for me.
<i> Where are the police?</i> They'll be there soon.
But he's probably gonna find you first.
<i> STEPHEN: Claribelle!</i> <i>-CLARIBELLE: He's gonna take me.</i> I don't want to go. <i> Hey, listen to me.</i> You have to go with him. <i> STEPHEN: Claribelle.</i> I know it's scary, but it's the safest thing for you to do right now. <i> Claribelle?</i> <i> Claribelle? Baby.</i> Let him take you.
Please don't make me, Maddie.
I promise it's gonna be okay.
(door bangs open) STEPHEN: Claribelle, baby, where are you?
He's here.
Don't let him see you have a phone.
STEPHEN: There you are.
Why would you lock the door like that <i> on me, sweetheart?</i> <i> CLARIBELLE: Where's Mom?</i> Mommy's resting.
We have to go, now.
I'm not leaving Mom.
<i> STEPHEN:</i> <i> We have to go now.</i> Come on.
Mommy!
<i> STEPHEN:</i> <i> Claribelle.</i> Claribelle.

Sorry, I-I know you're-you're supposed to be relaxing. I...
No, no, no, no.
I have never been happier to see someone show up unannounced at my house, ever. Please.
Uh, guessing the relaxing is-is not going so well.
(scoffs) Doing nothing is giving me more anxiety than trying to do everything.
I'm not wired for this.
What's happening?
What do you know about sperm donors?
HEN: And you didn't say no?
Mm. I didn't feel like I could.
Right. Your "age of absolutely" thing.
No, no, no. Not even just 'cause of that.
I didn't want to turn them down. I felt bad for them.
Which is very kind of you.
I mean, me and Karen have been where they are.
When you're trying and you want it, and it's just not happening, it's devastating.
If you said yes, you'd be changing their lives.
Right, which is-is, uh, a pro.
You know, a-a big pro.
If I can help ease this burden for them, why would I not do that?
'Cause you'd be also changing your life.
Yeah, come on, for, like... a few minutes?
Ew. Stop.
(chuckling) But, seriously, for the rest of your life.
This isn't an anonymous donation, Buck.
You won't have to wonder whether there's a kid out there with your DNA.
You're gonna know there is.
You'll probably get Christmas cards.
(exhales) The main thing to ask yourself...
is are you capable of doing this?
I think we both know I'm...
I'm-I'm capable, uh, that's why they asked me.
Are you capable of being a father and walking away?
Because that's what they're really asking you.
Donor, not dad.
Exactly.
You'd be changing their lives, but they're not necessarily inviting you to stick around and be a part of it.
Right.
Yeah.
I guess-I guess I never really thought about that part.
You need to.
Huh.
Hey Maddie. How's your day going?
Yesterday was a wild ride.
Yeah.
It was. Thanks for your help with that.
I can't believe you were able to find that other call.
I heard mom's doing okay.
Yeah.
Some broken bones, lacerations. She'll heal.
Poor kid.
Can't even imagine what it must have been like for her.
Not just yesterday, but all those years seeing her dad put hands on her mom.
Yeah, I don't wish for anyone to go through what that girl and her mom have.
Me either.
Don't get me wrong.
My mom totally dated a bunch of losers after my dad died.
But none of them ever hurt her in that way.
And then she finally found my stepdad, so...
Happy ending.
(indistinct chatter) Dispatch 118 is at the sorority house.
This way!
Okay, let's make some room.
You have to help him, please. Please help Hoover.
(whining) EDDIE: That's a...
Yep.
You have to help him, please.
Okay, I want everybody to take a step back, including you.
He's in our hands now.
What do we do, Cap?
What we always do.
Start assessing the patient.
CHIMNEY: Let me take a look.
(Hoover whining) Got a pulse. Thready, but it's there.
EDDIE: Respirations are shallow.
I count six breaths a minute.
CHIMNEY: Got a lot of drool around the mouth.
Okay, hand me the Ambu bag. I'm gonna support his respirations.
Okay. Dispatch said this was an OD. What did this dog get into?
Nope, sorry.
I'm out.
What did he eat?
He found it on the floor.
He wasn't supposed to eat it.
You didn't think a dog named Hoover would eat anything he could find?
SHERYL: I don't know. Did President Hoover eat random things?
Hoover, like the vacuum.
Oh.
Oh. (cries) It's opioids.
How much was in there?
It wasn't mine. Someone must've brought it with them.
This isn't working. I lost his pulse.
It's an OD. How about Narcan?
Not a veterinarian. I've never given Narcan to an animal before.
Hen would know.
Thought we weren't supposed to call her.
It's an emergency, clearly.
What? You're... you're coding a what?
N-No, no. Hang on, hang on.
I need someone else to confirm this is actually happening.
Tell Buck what you're coding.
<i> Uh, it's a dog.</i> <i> OD'd on opioids.</i> Are you two drunk?
<i> BUCK:</i> <i> Absolutely.</i> It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
It's 5:00 somewhere.
(Hen laughs) <i> HEN:</i> <i> How much does it weigh?</i> 15 pounds, give or take. <i> Okay.</i> <i> Point oh four</i> kilograms per milligram.
That's six point eight...
<i> Two point seven</i> milligrams Narcan.
2.7.
Thanks, Hen.
Come on, buddy.
<i> EDDIE: All right.</i> <i> CHIMNEY: Ready?</i> Come on, buddy.
(barks) (students exclaim) Hoover!
GIRL: Oh, he's okay.
BOBBY: All right.
Come here, little buddy. Here we go.
Oh, wait.
Let's go.
Wait, where are you taking Hoover?
To a vet and then into protective custody.
That's a thing?
It is now.
Mm.
You did math in your head.
(chuckles) I know, right?
(laughs) Take that, doctor professor lady who flunked me.
She's an idiot.
Mm-hmm.
You know, so what-- you failed some stupid test, but your-your instincts...
are incredible.
You would have made one heck of a doctor.
Mm.
<i> BOY:</i> <i> Are you guys set</i> <i> for Logan's birthday party</i> <i> next weekend?</i> <i> You're going, right?</i> CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Totally.
(blankets rustling) (Christopher continuing indistinctly) Logan said he would have anything, but his mom wouldn't let him.
Then Logan said that he was getting a batting cage for his birthday.
It's gonna be so cool.
Off. Now.
I got to go.
What do you think you're doing?
What part of "no video games for a week" don't you understand?
It's not fair. You never let me do anything on my own.
I'm not a baby, and you always treat me like one.
I don't<i> think</i> you're a baby, but you sure are acting like one.
And you're acting like a jerk!
Do not use that tone with me.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't want you to feel like a baby.
And I don't want you to think I'm a jerk.
But... okay.
Maybe sometimes I can't help myself.
You know, my instinct is to always protect you, Chris.
I don't need you to protect me.
Well, I'm not sure I know how to stop.
You're growing up on me, bud.
But you still need to respect me and to be honest with me.
We need to look out for each other.
You... Talk to each other about what we're going through, okay?
Okay.
And I love you, but when you break the rules, there are gonna be consequences.
And facing them is what makes you a young man.
And we've already established, clearly, that's what you are, right?
Right.
So once your punishment's over, we can...
talk about you going to the park and hanging out with your friends without me around.
Awesome. Thanks, Dad.
Don't thank me just yet, 'cause your punishment just got extended by one week.
Oh, come on.
No. Now get to bed.
Night, Dad.
Good night.
(indistinct announcement over P. A.) MADDIE: May I come in?
Hi, Claribelle.
How do you...
I'm Maddie.
Maddie?
Hi.
You were the one that sent the help?
Yes. Uh, and I brought someone that I think could help some more.
Hello, Lourdes. My name is Yvette.
I'm an immigration lawyer. I work with victims of domestic violence.
I don't understand.
Uh, Claribelle said that you were undocumented.
Stephen promised that he will get me my green card, but he never did.
He said that I could not get one without him.
He lied to you.
Under the Violence Against Women Act, you can self-petition.
You do not need to ask your abuser for anything.
So, I'll get to stay here?
I think we got a good shot.
And if all goes well, yes, you'll get to stay here.
LOURDES: Why?
Why would you do this for us?
I've been where you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
(sniffles) CLARIBELLE: Maddie, wait!
Thank you.
(chuckles) You are a very strong and smart girl.
You took good care of your mom.
Be proud of yourself.
I just did what she told me.
She taught me how to run.
No.
She taught you how to fight.
(chuckles softly) <i> DR. SIMMONS:</i> <i> I think we should move</i> these two bullet points to a new slide.
No one's gonna be able to read that.
Ms. Wilson.
I-I... I'm-I'm sorry to barge in.
Your office said you were in here.
Um, do you have a minute?
Why don't you get started on those changes.
We'll go through the rest later.
Okay.
Come on in.
(door closes) How can I help you?
Give me a second chance.
I-I have good instincts.
A-And a lot of paramedic experience in the field.
I-I care. I care about patients and saving lives.
I-I know that I completely bombed on my final.
But I also know that I could be a really good doctor.
How badly do you want to be a really good doctor?
Enough that I will put myself and my family through another 12 months of hell if I have to repeat this year.
But I'm really hoping I don't have to.
(scoffs softly) All right, Ms. Wilson.
I'll give you a second chance.
Next week.
A practical exam with me and my patients.
We will see just how good those instincts really are.
<i> (door opens)</i> <i> ATHENA: Bobby, are you home?</i> Hey.
Oh!
What are you doing home? I thought your flight was tonight.
Oh, Mama wanted her space back and Daddy sent me away, so I thought I'd catch an earlier flight to surprise you.
(laughs) Mwah.
Mwah.
Are you surprised?
Yes, I am. I'm happy to have you back home.
Ooh, something smells good.
What are you cooking? I'm starving.
Well...
Yeah, that's-that's not for us.
Oh, uh...
Uh, no, no... What is this?
Well, Athena, I would like you to meet Hoover.
Hmm.
(Hoover whines) Like the vacuum cleaner?
Exactly.
(Hoover whines) <i> BUCK:</i> <i> Thank you guys for</i> coming over.
I've been giving this a lot of thought.
Uh, thinking about, you know, wh-where I am in my life and what I want, and...
and how this would fit in with that.
And?
Uh, and honestly, I...
haven't figured any of that out.
(chuckles) I-I have no idea what I want.
But it is clear to me...
... that you know what you want.
And one thing I do know is-is that I-I want to help you have that.
Are you... are you saying what I think you're saying?
I'm saying yes.
I'm saying I will absolutely be your sperm donor.
Oh!

@@@@@@
(crickets chirping) (loud clatter) (gasps) (loud clatter) (line ringing) You're on a landline, so I've got your address.
Help is on the way. Can you tell me your name?
My name is Sharlo Darzi.
Oh, my God, I think they're downstairs.
Okay, Sharlo, help is on the way.
I just need some information. Do you live alone?
(whispering): With my husband, but he's out of town all week.
I have to get out of here.
<i> JOSH:</i> <i> You should stay</i> <i> where you are.</i> Officers are headed your way now, Sharlo.
Is there someplace you can hide until they arrive?
<i> Are you still there?</i> (whispering): I'm not waiting. <i> Sharlo...</i> No. I have to get out.
Sharlo, it's better if you stay put.
No. What if they find me?
<i> I don't have a way</i> <i> of defending myself.</i> <i> I'm going to the neighbor's</i> <i> house.</i> Okay, can you give me your gate code?
I'll relay it to the officers.
Oh, no, I don't have the gate clicker.
<i> It's in my car.</i> <i> I have to go through</i> <i> the kitchen.</i> Sharlo, I need you to stay inside the house until the police arrive.
<i> And can you give me</i> <i> the gate code</i> <i> so they can make entry?</i> <i> SHARLO:</i> <i> The gate code is 9-2-7-3-5-3.</i> <i> And I'm not waiting for them.</i> <i> JOSH:</i> <i> Police are seconds away.</i> I am not staying in here.
(thud, door creaks) Oh, God.
Sharlo, what's happening?
(whimpering) Are they in the house?
(screaming) (Sharlo cries out) (line goes dead) (gasps) Sh-Sharlo?
Ma'am, ma'am, are... Can you hear me?
(siren wailing) <i> ATHENA:</i> <i> Dispatch, this is 727-L-30,</i> <i> approaching the residence now.</i> (indistinct police radio chatter) (sirens approaching) We responded to a home invasion in progress.
Found the homeowner unconscious.
And the invaders?
ATHENA: House is clear.
No signs of forced entry?
ATHENA: Uh, just some spilled food in the kitchen.
Dispatch says that she called from upstairs.
Spotted the intruder in the kitchen and ran.
She took one hell of a tumble.
She's breathing but unresponsive.
Pulse is elevated.
I mean, something must have really scared her, right?
You-you sure there's no one else here?
I'm positive, Detective Buckley.
(Sharlo groaning) We have to get out. We have to...
(loud crack) (Sharlo yells, others groan) That was her pelvis.
Ma'am, I need you to stay still.
A pelvic injury can lead to internal hemorrhaging.
I'll give you something for the pain, okay?
Start a line. Four milligrams of morphine.
I got the splint sheet.
(groaning) Ma'am, you told 911 that you saw someone in the kitchen.
Who did you see?
(pained cry) It wasn't a man. It was...
a monster.
Ma'am, we didn't find anyone in the house.
It was in the kitchen.
Breadcrumbs.
(chittering) This is Buckley.
I've apprehended the suspect.
(chuckles) Oh!
Careful, Buckley.
You could break a hip.
(exhales sharply) I told my husband to get rid of the dog door.
We don't even have a dog anymore.
BOBBY: Don't worry, ma'am, no more home invasions.
I've got my top man on the case.
(whirring) (raccoon chittering) And stay out.
<i> MADDIE:</i> <i> When was the last time we had</i> an entire meal at this table uninterrupted?
I don't think it's ever happened.
So what should we do now?
I think I'm gonna have another cup of coffee.
Oh, uh, Magda, you don't have to do this.
You're here for Jee, not us.
I can do both. (chuckles) So, uh, where are you two off to today?
The park.
A little fresh air, some sunlight.
It kills potentially harmful bacteria.
I have your phone numbers. I've turned on location sharing.
I have power.
I packed all of Jee-yun's favorite snacks and toys.
It'll be fine. Hmm?
Say bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, bye-bye, baby. Love you.
Bye, Mommy.
Bye, Jee, I love you.
You both have a great day at work. Hmm?
You, too.
This is weird.
This is totally weird.
We just let a woman we've known for less than a week walk off with our daughter.
We did extensive background checks.
We called 11 of her references. Should we have done 12?
We should have done 12.
She can turn off location sharing.
I sewed a GPS tracker into her stuffed animal.
(both laugh) So we're gonna be fine?
Yeah.
Okay.
Ha!
All right, let's clean up and go to work.
Okay.
(phones chime) Oh, it's from Magda.
"Leave the dishes. I'll take care of them." (phones chime) "I have a system." How did she know?
<i> NOAH:</i> <i> So how's the new nanny?</i> It's good, I think.
I'm still getting used to a stranger being in my home, and she prefers the term "household manager." Who does?
Maddie and Chimney's new nanny.
Uh...
Household manager.
You hired someone to manage your household?
Well, now that Chimney and I are living together, we're saving on rent, so we have enough to hire some help.
Fire her. Fire her now.
Why are we already firing this person?
Do you know her?
Don't need to.
It's a stranger in your home.
All in your business. Recipe for disaster.
It's gonna be fine, I think.
I'm sensing there's a story here.
The story is called <i> Downton Abbey.</i> The help is always watching, overstepping and talking smack. You never seen it?
No. Now I kind of want to.
Mm-hmm.
(door shuts) <i> ATHENA: Are we hanging out</i> <i> or moving back?</i> Is the second one an option?
(chuckles) I just need a quiet place to study.
What about your apartment?
It's been invaded.
One of my roommates has this new frat-boy boy toy.
I can't escape him. He's always there.
Doesn't he have classes of his own?
I'm starting to doubt that.
(sniffles) Oh...
Oh.
Are you okay?
(door opens, shuts) Your apartment is not the only place that's being invaded.
Oh.
Hey, May.
Hey.
Oh, my God, you got a dog? When?
Well, he's sort of a rescue.
You always said we couldn't get a dog.
What?
Mom's allergies.
(sneezes) You said this was a cold.
Oh, you seemed so attached...
Oh.
I thought maybe it wouldn't be that bed.
He does seem really sweet, Mom.
BOBBY: Oh, he's a great dog.
I don't suppose they allow pets at your place?
(sneezes) Oh.
(dog yawns) BOBBY: Okay.
I guess Hoover's gonna need a new home.
What's your address?
<i> 719 Alexander Street.</i> Is there more than one suspect in the house?
<i> Definitely more than one.</i> Do they know you're in the house?
<i> I don't think so. I came home</i> <i> to grab a few things.</i> <i> I came upstairs,</i> <i> and I heard them talking.</i> Police are on their way.
Are you in a safe location right now?
<i> No. I'm afraid to go</i> <i> back downstairs.</i> <i> They may see me.</i> Is there another room upstairs where you can hide?
<i> Maybe the guest room.</i> <i> INTRUDER: Somebody's home!</i> <i> Somebody's home!</i> <i> CALLER:</i> <i> Oh, God!</i> <i> INTRUDER: He's running.</i> <i> Don't let him get away.</i> <i> (gunshot)</i> <i> (man cries out)</i> <i> INTRUDER: I got him!</i> Hello, sir are you there? <i> (gunshots)</i> Sir?

<i> (gunshots)</i> SUE: He's alive.
The paramedics dropped him off at the ER, and he's on his way into surgery now.
When I heard those gunshots...
The thing that makes us good at our jobs is the ability to listen closely and then picture what's happening on the other end of the line.
Sometimes those pictures are the stuff of nightmares.
By any chance, did they catch the guys that shot him?
No. Suspects were long gone by the time the police and paramedics arrived.
A home invasion in the middle of the day.
Yeah, robberies have definitely been on the rise.
And suspects are just getting a little more brazen.
Let's hope they find them before they strike again.
(sirens approaching) Rick.
Thanks.
What happened?
Hey. I heard you responded to a home invasion call here last night.
I wanted you to walk me through it.
ATHENA: Sharlo Darzi called in thinking she had an intruder.
Turned out just to be a raccoon.
So, who's our new victim?
Samir Darzi. The husband.
I thought he was out of town.
Flew back this morning when he found out about his wife.
He came home to pick some things out for her, discovered a robbery in progress, called 911.
They shot him while he was on the phone with the dispatcher. Three shots.
One in the shoulder, two in the back.
The raccoon definitely didn't do this.
Two home invasion calls from the same address less than 12 hours apart.
What are the odds?
Not ones I like.
Plan for today. I'll take Denny to school, but I have some meetings this afternoon, so Clive will pick him up after school and take him to practice.
I like when you poach the eggs.
Don't get pretentious.
Tony is gonna stop by midday to bring you some lunch, and I'll pick up Denny and dinner after work.
We should be home around 7:00.
Oh. What do I do all day?
Study.
So you could ace your practical exam with Doctor... What's-Her-Face.
Oh. Simmons.
Exactly.
See? We've got it all covered.
All you have to do is study.
(knock at door) Ooh, and get the door.
Denny, help me clear the table, please, now.
Yeah.
Cap.
Hey, Hen.
I'm sorry to just show up.
But I need a favor.
Let me guess.
Probably more than a favor.
Hoover, the infamous rescue dog?
To whom my wife is apparently highly allergic.
Bobby...
I know it's a lot to ask, but I figure you got plenty of space, you got a nice, big backyard...
And a wife who has sworn off pets since Paisley died.
Hoover is exceptional.
Uh, d-don't look at me like that.
You, either.
Oh, my God, is that a dog?
Yes, it is.
(Hoover barks) You are gonna owe me big-time.
Here.
Take it.
(toy squeaks) Yeah, he loves that thing.

My key doesn't work.
I changed all the locks yesterday.
Of course you did.
Wait, where did you get a key?
Oh, Mom thought you could use some help around the house.
Does no one remember that you're not handy?
You break one toilet...
And three dishwashers.
Plus that one time you almost caused an electrical fire.
I'm the one who always had to fix your fixes.
Well, I'm here to fix your utility bills.
It just so happens that, well, I know a guy who insulates houses.
He lent me his spray foam truck.
You borrowed a truck of foam?
Good stuff.
R-seven per inch.
And how many inches?
In California, it is recommended that your attic should have an R Value between 30 and 60.
So I'm thinking five inches.
(scoffs) You almost sound like you know what you're doing.
This stuff will save you thousands in heating and cooling costs.
And it'll block out all the traffic noise outside.
Like soundproofing. Come on, it's your first place.

Do you know if he has his phone on?
Have you tried calling him?
I've been calling him since before I called you.
He's not answering.
(line ringing) I'm not hearing any ringing.
Uh, he said he would soundproof the house.
Yeah, well, it looks like he insulated it pretty good, too.
I'm not getting any kind of heat signature.
How do we get him out if we can't find him?
Old-fashioned pick and poke.
Everybody gear up and spread out.
Uh, hang on. What are you poking?
Vincent?
Vincent!
Vincent!
Vincent!
Vincent, LAFD.
Vincent!
Vincent, are you okay?
Vincent?
Vincent!
Vincent?
Vincent.
Vincent!
Vincent, if you can hear us, tap or knock on anything you can find.
Vincent.
Vincent!
Vincent!
Vincent!
Vincent, can you hear me?
Over here!
Guys, I want you to start poking inspection holes.
I want to find the edges of that plywood floor up there.
Cap, should I grab some supports?
No, it wouldn't be enough.
We need something stronger.
Well, you know what? This is a DIY family, so let's DIY it.
(grunting) (chain saw buzzing) (muffled, indistinct chatter) Let's go. Let's pry him out. Let's go. Let's do it. Come on.
(grunting) Two, three! (grunts) All right.
BOBBY: Gurney coming in. Gurney coming in.
Ma'am, I need you to stay outside.
It's not safe in here.
On three. One, two, three.
Yeah.
Pull him up on three. One, two, three!
Checking airway.
Lungs are clear, but breathing is shallow.
All right, let's get him out of here! Let's move!
Sats at 92, starting him on high-flow O2.
Pulse is thready.
Beginning sternum rub.
Vincent, can you hear us?
No response.
Breathing is shallow.
Vincent, I'm gonna give you some rescue breaths here.
Start breathing with this. Come on, buddy.
Why isn't he waking up?
Come on, Vincent!
Come on, buddy.
Vincent, come back to us, buddy.
All right, he's picking up.
There it is. There it is.
That's it, that's it!
There you go.
Vincent, thank God.
(coughing) What happened?
You almost died.
I can't believe that you were up there.
I just wanted to prove I could do it. Help you.
Like a big brother.
You know what would be helpful? To not almost die on me.
Never do that again.
Okay. Is the house okay?
We'll talk about it later.
(siren wailing) Hey there.
You ready for your big day tomorrow?
I think so. You want to quiz me?
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
What happened to the only thing I should be focused on is studying?
Well, you've been studying nonstop, and now it's time to let it go and trust that you've done your best.
And reward yourself for all your hard work.
What kind of reward did you have in mind?
(both laugh) I can't.
What?
Not with him watching.
(whining) Are you serious?
It's making me uncomfortable.
(sighs) Okay. Okay.
I'll just let him out.
Come here, boy. Yeah, that's a good boy.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, there you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Now...
(chuckles) ... where were we?
(Hoover whining) Oh, now he sounds sad.
Maybe he'll go down the hall to Denny's room.
(scratching at door) (sighs) (Hoover whining) Fine. Fine.
Fine, fine.
Fine. It's just fine.
Okay, you can come in, just...
Hey, Hoover, no, that's...
You are such a mood killer.
(knock on door) Hey, you apprehend our armed robbers yet?
No. But I think our home invasion is not an isolated case.
I found ten other burglaries in the last month with a similar M. O.
Pricey neighborhoods hit at all different times of the day, but in each case, the residents were never home.
Until Samir Darzi came home and got shot.
Mm.
That house have security cameras?
Oh, yeah.
Two guys, average height, average build, wearing ski masks and generic track suits.
They walk up with rolling duffel bags, they go inside, and they roll back out with all the jewelry and luxury items they can fit in the bags.
In and out in less than 20.
And they didn't set off any alarms or break a single door or window.
Yeah, I mean, they must have cased the place in advance, but what I can't figure out is how they pick their targets.
The victims don't have anything in common, except for being rich.
ATHENA: And the fact that they were guaranteed never to be home.
Wait. How?
Here.
"A homeowner interview was conducted "at El Dorado Union Hospital as Mr. Drake was recovering from heart surgery following a coronary incident." Okay, so this victim had a heart attack.
His house was broken into that night.
This one.
It says that the homeowner was injured in a kitchen fire.
She was still also in the hospital when her house was hit.
And there's another one.
"Victim is still recovering from a fractured shoulder after an unrelated slip and fall in the shower." Maybe not that unrelated.
Okay, so you have an accident or a medical emergency, you're in the hospital.
It's a great time for someone to come and rob you blind.
It still doesn't explain how they were able to get in and out the way they did.
I mean, they wouldn't have had time to case the place.
Unless someone had already done it for them.
Think about it. You're at home.
You start having chest pains, or you set your kitchen on fire. What do you do?
You call for help.
And "help" is gonna ask a lot of questions.
Paramedics can reset the alarm, ma'am. What is the alarm code?
Sir, the fire department is on the way.
You said you live alone?
Are there any dogs at your residence?
That's what all the victims had in common.
They all dialed 911.
(elevator bell chimes) So every robbery victim called 911?
Seems like the thieves used the hospital visits as an open invitation.
We need to look at everyone who was aware of the emergencies at these addresses, see if there's any overlap.
And you think a first responder might be involved in this?
Afraid so.
All right, let me check the list.
Um, Linda took this call. Linda Bates.
The 133 responded.
This one dispatcher was Josh Russo.
He sent the 142 to that scene.
Josh also took the raccoon call, but that time, he sent the 118.
This one in Brentwood, dispatcher was Rashida Marvel.
Firehouse was the 126.
Marlene took this other call, Jamal dispatched that one.
Henry, Moira. This is me.
I don't see anything in common here.
Yeah, other than residents from affluent zip codes.
It was worth a shot.
Yep. Well, thank you, Maddie.
Oh, wait.
What? You found something?
Yeah.
Every time someone pulls up a call record, the system makes a note of it-- who did it and when.
All of these calls were accessed multiple times by the same person.
Great. So who's our common denominator?
Uh...
Me.
Whoa, Magda, what is going on here?
Cleaning. I want everything to be pristine.
It's getting there.
Oh, don't worry, I have a system.
I'll put everything back in its place before... (gasps) You're wearing shoes.
Yeah, I sometimes do that, for the walking.
Did you know that shoes are 66,000 times dirtier than toilets?
I do now.
Uh, I'll take 'em off.
Just let me put this somewhere...
Mm...
All... right.
(Magda chuckles) (Magda sighs) So, uh, where's Maddie and Jee-Yun?
Oh, Maddie put Jee-Yun to bed an hour ago.
Then she went in the bathroom. She's been in there a while.
Probably plotting her escape.
What?
I should go make sure she's okay.
All right.
MADDIE: Who is it?
It's me.
Please let me in.
Come in.
Quick, close the door.
What is going on out there?
And what are you doing in the bathtub?
I needed a place to hide.
Jee's asleep, and Magda launched a full-on cleaning offensive.
Yeah, I had to cross enemy lines just to get in here.
I mean, I told her not to, but she insisted.
(grunts) Thank you.
Look at us. We're literally tiptoeing around our own house.
How was your day otherwise?
Oh, great.
I am a suspect in a string of burglaries.
The police think someone at the call center is using our log-in information to pick out potential victims.
Okay, but not you.
But whoever it is used my I. D. to access the files.
Athena said it won't take long to clear me because I wasn't even at the call center when half the log-ins happened.
Wow.
You think someone stole your password?
I guess so.
But I don't know how.
It's weird. It's not like you're logging in from a coffee shop or something.
No, but someone took my password anyway.
(indistinct chatter) (elevator bell chimes) Hi.
Hey. Anything you want to tell me?
(indistinct conversation) Hey. I thought you were off today.
Maddie, are you all right?
I don't know.
They called me in. Sue wants to see me.
Why?
I think I'm getting fired.
Fired? What?
Yeah, you know about the burglaries.
Right? All the victims called 911, and they think that I'm the connection.
But they didn't call you, did they?
No, but my log-in was used to access those recordings, and nobody else had that information.
Maddie, they can't fire you.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Doesn't matter.
My name is on all the call records.
But if that's all they have...
It's enough.
Even if they can't prove that I helped the thieves, because I didn't, I can't prove that I wasn't negligent with my password.
They can't arrest me, but I can lose my job anyway.
No. That's not fair.
Honestly, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I mean, I love this place.
Helping people, saving lives.
You know what I mean?
That feeling you get when you know that you're doing the right thing?
Yeah.
It's all gonna go away because of some stupid lost password.
You didn't lose your password, Maddie.
I took it.
That day I asked you about the active logs, you showed me how to access them.
Put in your I. D. number, and...
<i> NOAH:</i> <i> I watched you log in.</i> I almost forgot about that.
I used the calls to find out when a house would be empty, and I passed along the information.
I promise you, Maddie, no one was supposed to get hurt.
The houses were supposed to be empty.
I-I was always careful.
You weren't careful. You were lucky.
A man got shot. He could've died.
I know.
And I'm really sorry.
I just didn't know what else to do.
Why would you do this?
My stepdad-- he got into some money trouble.
He didn't want my mom and I to know, so he borrowed from the wrong people.
When he couldn't repay them, they hurt him.
He said they were gonna hurt my mom, too.
They knew I worked here.
So you were trying to repay his debt.
I didn't know what else to do.
I was too scared to tell anyone.
(sighs) I wish you would've told me.
We could've helped you.
Can you help me now?
Please, Maddie.
I'm sorry.
It's too late.
(sighs) You tricked me.
MADDIE: You lied to us.
To me.
What do I do?
Tell them everything.
If they can find these guys...
I know where they are.
What do you mean?
I told them about your investigation.
I thought that would make them stop.
They wanted one more job.
You gave them another house to hit?
(sighs) Where?

I don't think he likes being alone.
Maybe he has separation anxiety.
Think he needs a specialist.
<i> DR. SIMMONS:</i> <i> Diagnosis and treatment plan?</i> Patient presents with occasional tinnitus, vertigo, abnormal range of hearing loss.
I recommend surgery.
The middle fossa surgical approach is riskier to the facial nerve, but it's her only chance at retaining her hearing on that side.
We should do another MRI to verify.
With contrast.
Okay. Next stop.
Eddie.
Hey. I've been trying to call you.
Sorry. I was in the bathroom.
For three hours?
I'll tell you later.
What's with the dog?
It, uh, didn't work out, so I was wondering...
Oh. So cute.
So full of zoonotic disease.
(Hoover whimpers) Sorry, Eddie. I got to go.
That was weirder than usual.
<i> HEN:</i> <i> No known trauma to the brain.</i> BP's stable.
We should order a CT scan to assess the lesions in the brain stem, particularly cranial nerves three and five.

She said you're starting your third year at medical school.
And that's a demanding schedule.
Yeah, but it's just another year or two.
And then, start your residency.
Life as you know it is about to change.

In this house.
And we have all this space...
That you want to fill with your ex-girlfriend's kid.
Do you know how insane that sounds?
Can you put your jealousy aside for one minute?!
This it's jealousy, Hen.
You always said that you regretted not taking a stand with Eva earlier.
Well, this is me.
Taking a stand.
You need to tell her no.
And what if I can't?
<i> Then she walked out.</i> CHIMNEY: So, what are you gonna do?
HEN: I don't know.
It's so messy and complicated.
We bought a damn house together.
I never imagined that I'd need a lawyer to break up with my girlfriend.
(short chuckle) Hen, I know you don't want to hear this, but...
This is not about Eva.
Not in the way that you think it is.
Okay, so, how is it?
(sighs) Eva's using-- it didn't come from a recreational place.
The wounds she was trying to block out are old and deep.
I couldn't heal her and I couldn't save her.
But you can save the kid.
Feels like someone in this story should get a happy ending.
Zainab, thanks for looking after Denny.
I was so worried.
Of course. I'm just glad you're okay.
Yeah.
I just...
I just got lucky.
Are you okay? You sound a little...
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just... I have to catch my breath.
ATHENA: Oh, thank God.
Captain Nash?
Thanks again.
Take care. You bet.
(hyperventilating) Kar-Karen?
Ka-Karen, Karen. Karen!
Karen. Karen.
Karen, can you hear me?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Karen.
She's in V-tach. Pushing epi.
Let's shock her.
BOBBY: All right. Okay, clear.
<i> CHIMNEY:</i> <i> Karen, are you there?</i> What do you want, Howie?
<i> Karen,</i> <i> I don't know how to say this.</i> What, Howie?
Karen, Hen is dead.
♪ ♪ What? Wh...
What are you talking about?
Okay, okay, she's not. I'm sorry. Hen is not <i> actually dead, but-but she had</i> a pretty bad near-miss accident <i> last night.</i> What the hell, Howie?
You can't just say stuff like that.
<i> I know. I just, I...</i> We had a really tough call.
And it was rough and there was a minute when I thought Hen was dead, and it scared the crap out of me.
<i> KAREN:</i> <i> And</i> you decided to pay that experience forward?
Yes.
<i> Look...</i> (sighs) look, I know you two broke up.
And I just thought you needed to know what it would feel like if you woke up tomorrow and you found out <i> Hen wasn't</i> <i> in this world anymore.</i> Howie. <i> Karen,</i> you think about that before you get <i> on that plane, okay?</i> Goodbye, Howie.
And I'm so sorry, Karen.
<i> I'm so sorry.</i> <i> WOMAN:</i> <i> Attention, passengers</i> <i> on the flight 2112 to Houston.</i> <i> This is your last call</i> <i> for final boarding.</i> <i> Flight 2112...</i> <i> HEN:</i> <i> Karen! Come on, baby.</i> You can do this.
Okay, let's go again.
Clear.
Nothing.
Come on.
Come on, baby, you can do it.
(exhales) Uh. Hi?
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Never better.
Hen, what happened to you?
What are you doing here?
You don't live here anymore.
Howie said you got hurt.
(groans) I'm gonna kill him as so...
soon as I can get back on my feet.
Don't touch me.
Let me help you.
I don't need your help.
I don-I don't want you here. Just go.
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.
I was calling you, you wouldn't answer.
And now... (scoffs) Why are you here?
Because I thought you were dead.
When Howie called, there was a moment when I thought you died in that accident.
When I felt like I'd lost you forever.
And it scared me.
To think of you being gone.
Never having a chance to fix things or try again.
Karen, it's too late.
It's not.
As long as we are both here on this Earth...
As long as we have tomorrow, it's not too late.
Okay, we've got a normal rhythm.
(sobbing) (indistinct chatter) (panting) Oh... How's she doing?
Karen's out of surgery. They removed her spleen.
It must have gotten nicked when the tank shrapnel pierced her abdomen and then it burst when she got outside.
But you can live without a spleen, right?
Yeah, people do it every day.
She's gonna be okay.
They're gonna hold her for observation, but she should be able to go home in a couple of days.
(indistinct announcement over P. A.) Hey, hey, there, hey, there.
(groaning) (chuckling) Oh, thank God.
We were so worried about you.
Uh, is...
is everyone okay?
Hitu. Uh, my team?
Yeah, yeah.
Alvin and-and Hitu-- they'll-they'll need some time to heal, but they're gonna to be okay.
Oh, yeah?
And-and everyone else, they...
they got out with minor scrapes and burns.
And Zainab, she's...
she's in the waiting room.
She was so concerned about you.
Victor?
I'm sorry.
He died in the initial blast.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God.
Denny?
Denny-- what did he see?
He's fine. He's fine.
He's fine. He's sleeping over at Toni's till we're back home.
Was he scared?
Just worried about you.
We all were.
Right.
I thought I'd lost you.
(laughs) Nope.
Still here.
(both laughing) (Karen groans) I asked the nurse to, uh...
to give me some kind of a cot or something so that I could...
stay here with you tonight.
No. Go home.
No, Karen. I'm not...
Denny...
needs you.
He comes first.
Mama?
Oh, hey.
Hey, sweetie. You couldn't sleep?
No.
When's Mom coming home from the hospital?
I think it's gonna be at least another day or two before that.
But she's okay, right?
Oh, yeah, she's gonna be fine.
Little bit of rest and she'll be back to herself.
I was really scared.
I'm glad you were there to save her.
Me too.
Okay. You want some cocoa?
Yeah.
You get the cups and I'll get the milk started.
Okay.
(cupboard opens) (cupboard closes) Mama? You coming?
Yeah. I'm coming.
(baby cooing) Are we supposed to take him out of the carrier?
Uh...
Feels weird to have him on the coffee table.
You know, I don't....
He doesn't seem to mind.
I mean, or we could call your mom and-and ask her.
No, no.
She will take that as an invitation, and we will not be rid of her until he leaves for college.
(giggling) We can figure this out together.
Yeah.
(coos) (phone dings) And with the help of Google.
Yes. Yes.
(cooing) Google.
Okay.
Hey.
It's official.
What?
Senate votes 63 to 31 to repeal "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." (chuckling) (gasps) Finally.
So, what-- does this mean I'm about to be living with an astronaut?
Oh...
Do you have any idea what that would entail?
There's no way I can do that with a baby.
But Karen, this was your dream.
It was.
Now I have a new one.
Here on Earth.
With you.
And Denny.
(Denny crying) Oh. Uh...
Oh, oh, all right.
I-I'll grab the bottle.
I'll grab the baby.
Okay.
See?
Teamwork.
We got this.
HEN: All right, easy.
(grunts) Slowly.
Oh...
Here we are.
We got you set up on the couch.
We made you a little recovery room (chuckling) so that you don't have to get up and move around as much.
Hen, I'm fine.
You are not fine, and don't try to argue with me about it.
♪<i> And when your hope</i> ♪ ♪<i> Starts to fade...</i> ♪ (door closes) You heard your doctor.
You're on strict bed rest.
Don't make me give him a call.
♪<i> Don't be afraid...</i> ♪ Oh. (groans) I hate this part.
(Hen chuckles) And blowing up would have been a better part?
You know what I mean.
Endless hours of TV, book after book, magazine after magazine, just...
waiting for the body to heal itself.
Waiting is mind-numbing.
(chuckling) My wife.
The Eveready Bunny. (laughs) Well, I have to be.
'Cause my wife is starting year three of medical school.
And somebody's gonna have to pick up the slack around here.
I'm not.
I'm going back to work, not med school.
H... Hen, I-I'm gonna be back up on my feet soon.
You don't have to quit...
Listen, someone told me, recently, that my life as I knew it was gonna change completely.
Oh, okay. But we knew that, didn't we?
I'm not sure I did.
I mean, I was-I was dreaming of being a doctor, but I don't think I really considered the reality of what I'd have to give up or miss out on.
Being a firefighter, being a mom, being your wife?
That's what matters to me.
Grammy helped me make you a cake.
(chuckles) Thank you, sweetheart.
Come here.
I-I need another hug.
Are you gonna hug me every time I come into the room?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Did Mama tell you she's gonna be a firefighter again?
Oh...
Yeah, she did.
How do you feel about that?
I think her uniform's cooler than scrubs.
I mean, so, clearly, I've made the right decision.
(chuckles) Hen, are you sure?
That was your dream.
